## Fake media bubbles 


My goal for the project is to generate the fake title of articles based on a real dataset from 17 different newspapers:

- Atlantic
- Breitbart 
- Business Insider
- Buzzfeed News
- CNN
- Fox News
- Guardian
- NPR
- National Review 
- New York Post
- New York Times 
- Reuters 
- Talking Points Memo
_ Vox
- Washington Post
- Abc news 
- Tass
- Europe 

My model can also recommend real articles that are the most similar to the generated fake title.

You can also generate fake articles and predict what publication the most likely it can be.

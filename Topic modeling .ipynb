       "[['Betsy DeVos Confirmed as Education Secretary, With Pence Casting Historic Tie-Breaking Vote nan Michigan billionaire education activist Betsy DeVos was confirmed today to serve as the secretary of education in President Trump\\'s administration, after Vice President Mike Pence cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate. The Senate voted on DeVos\"?highly contentious nomination this afternoon, and the tally was split evenly, requiring Pence to use his authority as president of the upper chamber of Congress to break the impasse. This was the first time that a vice president has broken a tie to confirm a Cabinet nominee. Pence read the vote count 50-50 and then voted himself, rendering the tally 51-50. The day before the vote, Democrats staged a 24-hour marathon of speeches, with more than 30 lawmakers taking to the floor to urge at least one additional Republican to vote against DeVos and block her confirmation. \"It is hard to imagine a worse choice,\"?Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said before she read letters from constituents urging her to vote no. DeVos stirred up vehement opposition from teachers\"?unions and all 48 Senate Democrats. Many cited concerns about her support of school vouchers, which critics believe will weaken public schools, and her lack of experience, since she never attended or worked in the public education system. Others cited her lack of familiarity with a landmark law protecting the education needs of disabled children.     She was panned for a gaffe during her confirmation hearing, when she hedged on an answer about guns in schools by saying they might be needed in states like Wyoming to defend against \"potential grizzlies.\"?DeVos\\' nomination drew above-average negative reactions from the public, with voters flooding Senate phone lines and email accounts in recent weeks. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said his office received 14,000 calls about DeVos. In addition to the entire Democratic caucus, two moderate Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska announced they would not support DeVos. During a speech announcing her opposition, Collins said DeVos\"?focus on charters and vouchers \"raises the question of whether or not she fully appreciates that the secretary of education\\'s primary focus must be on helping states and communities, parents, teachers, school board members and administrators strengthen our public schools.\"?Before the confirmation vote, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee voted along party lines, 12-11, to refer DeVos\"?nomination to the full Senate.

       " ['Melania Trump Says White House Could Mean Millions for Brand nan First lady Melania Trump has said little about what she intends to do with her prominent position. But in new court documents, her lawyers say that the \"multi-year term\" during which she \"is one of the most photographed women in the world\" could mean millions of dollars for her personal brand. While the new documents don\\'t specifically mention her term as first lady, the unusual statement about her expected profits drew swift condemnation from ethics watchdogs as inappropriate profiteering from her high-profile position, which is typically centered on public service. The statement came Monday in a libel lawsuit the first lady re-filed in a state trial court in Manhattan. Trump has been suing the corporation that publishes the Daily Mail\\'s website over a now-retracted report that claimed she once worked as an escort. In the filing Monday, Trump\\'s lawyers argued that the report was not only false and libelous, but also damaged her ability to profit off her high profile and affected her business opportunities. Trump \"had the unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, as an extremely famous and well-known person, as well as a former professional model, brand spokesperson and successful businesswoman, to launch a broad-based commercial brand in multiple product categories, each of which could have garnered multi-million dollar business relationships for a multi-year term during which plaintiff is one of the most photographed women in the world,\" the lawsuit said. The products could have included apparel, accessories, jewelry, cosmetics, hair care and fragrance, among others, the suit says. The first lady is seeking compensatory and punitive damages of at least $150 million. Richard Painter, who advised former President George W. Bush on ethics, said the language in the lawsuit shows Melania Trump is engaging \"in an unprecedented, clear breach of rules about using her government position for private gain. This is a very serious situation where she says she intends to make a lot of money. That ought to be repudiated by the White House or investigated by Congress.\" Painter is part of a group of attorneys suing the president for an alleged violation of a constitutional clause that prohibits presidents from receiving foreign gifts or payments. In response to questions from The Associated Press, Charles Harder, Melania Trump\\'s attorney, said \"the first lady has no intention of using her position for profit and will not do so. It is not a possibility. Any statements to the contrary are being misinterpreted.\" Harder did not respond to a follow-up question about what the lawsuit means by \"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\" To Painter and others, there is no ambiguity. \"She\\'s not talking about the future,\" Painter said. \"She\\'s talking about earning money now.\" Scott Amey, general counsel of the Washington watchdog Project on Government Oversight, said it is \"another example of the first family blurring the line between public service and private business interests.\" Trump previously filed the lawsuit against Mail Media Inc. in Maryland, but a judge earlier this month ruled the case was filed in the wrong court. The lawsuit is now filed in New York, where the corporation has offices. Trump also had sued blogger Webster Tarpley for reporting the unsubstantiated rumors. Trump filed the lawsuit in Maryland after both Tarpley and the Daily Mail issued retractions. On Tuesday, Melania Trump\\'s attorneys said they\\'d settled the Maryland case against Tarpley. \"Mr. Tarpley has issued the attached retraction and apology to Mrs. Trump and her family, and agreed to pay her a substantial sum as a settlement,\" Harder\\'s office said in a statement. Melania Trump\\'s previous work in marketing has drawn scrutiny before. On Inauguration Day, the official White House biography for Melania Trump originally included an explicit reference to her jewelry collection, which it noted was sold on the home-shopping channel QVC. By the next day, that bio had been edited and simplified to say that she had \"launched her own jewelry collection.\" A spokeswoman for the first lady said the website was updated out of \"an abundance of caution\" and that the jewelry line is no longer available in any case. President Donald Trump continues to financially benefit from his global business empire, breaking from past practice. Previous presidents and their families have divested from business interests and placed their holdings in a blind trust, although there is no legal requirement to do so. Trump handed daily management of the real estate, property management and licensing to his adult sons and a longtime Trump Organization employee.'],\n",
       " ['As Trump Fears Fraud, GOP Eliminates Election Commission nan A House committee voted on Tuesday to eliminate an independent election commission charged with helping states improve their voting systems as President Donald Trump erroneously claims widespread voter fraud cost him the popular vote. The party-line vote came less than two days after Trump vowed to set up a White House commission helmed by Vice President Mike Pence to pursue his accusations of election fraud. \"We\\'re going to look at it very, very carefully,\" Trump said of voter fraud in an interview with Fox News that aired Sunday. \"It has to do with the registration, and when you look at the registration and you see dead people that have voted.\" Reports that Trump told congressional leaders in a meeting last month that 3 to 5 million ballots were cast illegally during the 2016 race were met with discomfort on Capitol Hill. While top Republicans have refused to disavow his charges of election fraud, they haven\\'t pushed for action on the issue, which remains a low priority for congressional leadership. The vote in the House Administration Committee underscored, once again, the political differences between the Republican president and the party\\'s rank-and-file. The GOP majority on the committee eliminated the Election Assistance Commission, which was created by Congress after the 2000 Florida recount to upgrade voting technology and provide election-related information to federal entities, state officials and election administrators. Republicans say the commission is a prime example of government waste. They\\'ve been introducing legislation to end the commission for years with little success. \"If we\\'re looking at reducing the size of government this is a perfect example of something that can be eliminated,\" said Rep. Gregg Harper, the committee chairman. \"We don\\'t need fluff.\" Harper said he hadn\\'t spoken to Trump about the legislation. \"He\\'s certainly welcome to call me at any time,\" he said. The bill was opposed by committee Democrats and voting rights groups, who argued that the federal agency plays a vital role in protecting elections from hacking and other types of interference. \"At a time when the vast majority of the country\\'s voting machines are outdated and in need of replacement, and after an election in which foreign criminals already tried to hack state voter registration systems, eliminating the EAC poses a risky and irresponsible threat to our election infrastructure,\" said Wendy Weiser, the democracy program director at the Brennan Center for Justice. The committee also voted to terminate the public financing system, which provides major party presidential nominees a lump sum grant of roughly $94.14 million in the general election. But by accepting the grant, a candidate may not raise any additional funds and is severely limited in how much of his own money he can give or lend to his campaign. President Barack Obama effectively ended the practice of candidates taking general election public financing in 2008, when he chose not to accept it. His Republican rival John McCain took the grant that year and was swamped by the Obama campaign\\'s spending. Neither Hillary Clinton nor Trump accepted public financing this year. Money for the public financing of campaigns is collected through voluntary $3 checkoffs on taxpayers\\' returns. The checkoffs do not affect how much money a taxpayer owes. The legislation would devote $63 million of the available funds to pediatric cancer research. The remainder would be returned to the Treasury for deficit reduction. It is not clear if the full House will vote on the measures.'],\n",
       " ['Appeals Court to Decide on Challenge to Trump\\'s Immigration Executive Order nan This afternoon, three federal judges from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals will hear oral arguments in the emergency legal challenge to President Trump\\'s executive order that temporarily bars immigration and travel to the U.S. for people from seven Muslim-majority countries and for refugees. The hearing, which will be conducted over the phone at 3 p.m. Pacific time, will allow each side to give 30-minute arguments. The plaintiffs in this appeal, Washington and Minnesota, will state their case, as will the Department of Justice. The public can listen to the hearings live on the 9th Circuit website. The judges are expected to rule on the future of the executive order after hearing oral arguments. While their decision won\\'t determine the constitutionality of Trump\\'s immigration ban, it will determine whether the suspension of the executive order, ruled by U.S. District Court Judge James Robart, will remain. The two states have argued that Trump\\'s order was likely to cause \"irreparable harm\" to businesses, schools, family relations and state residents\\' freedom to travel and is unconstitutional because it discriminates on the basis of religion. The Justice Department said the travel restrictions are a matter of national security and the administration was excluding people from countries with ties to terrorism, not people of a certain religion.     Today, Trump suggested that the legal battle between the two states and the Justice Department could make it all the way to the Supreme Court. \"We\\'re going to take it through the system,\" said Trump. \"It\\'s very important for the country, regardless of me or whoever succeeds at a later date.\" On Capitol Hill today, Secretary of >Homeland Security John Kelly defended the immigration executive order, calling it \"lawful and constitutional.\" Only a week old, the order has sparked protests and outcry across the country. The legal community has been grappling with the order, some travelers have been delayed, and others are wondering if they will be allowed previously approved entry into the United States. The order, called Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States, bars all people with immigrant and nonimmigrant visas from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from coming to the U.S. for 90 days. It also prevents the entry of refugees from anywhere in the world for 120 days, with an indefinite ban on refugees from the war-torn country of Syria. The Monday after Trump signed his order, Washington state filed a legal challenge that was joined by Minnesota. Robart, an appointee of President George W. Bush, on Friday issued a temporary restraining order, which covers the entire U.S., blocking the travel ban. Trump immediately took issue with the move, tweeting on Saturday, \"The opinion of this so-called judge ... is ridiculous and will be overturned!\" On Saturday the Department of Justice, challenging Robart\\'s ruling, turned to the powerful 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to try to immediately lift the restraining order while the appeal was being considered. The appeals court denied the request. The outcome of today\\'s hearing with the 9th Circuit could determine \"?at least temporarily \"?the fate of thousands of refugees, immigrants and travelers in the United States and abroad hoping to enter the U.S.'],\n",

Tornadoes were reported in New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Donaldsonville, Ponchatoula and Killian, according to ABC News meteorologist Melissa Griffin. Tornado watches were in effect for parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida panhandle. The tornado watch in Louisiana and Mississippi expired after 2 p.m., when the storms moved east, Griffin said. The tornado watch in Alabama and Florida is set to expire at 6 p.m. Severe storms are expected in cities such as Gulfport, Biloxi, Mobile and Pensacola. There could still be isolated and severe storms in North and South Carolina. As of Tuesday morning, at least 23 U.S. states were under winter weather alerts, and a tornado watch has been issued for parts of the Southeast as most of the country braces for severe weather this week. \"We are in a very active weather pattern all across the country, from California to New York,\"?ABC News senior meteorologist Max Golembo said. An atmospheric river, which draws massive amounts of water vapor from the Pacific Ocean, has taken aim at California, where the National Weather Service has issued flash flood and flood watches through Friday.   Copious rainfall is in the forecast for the West Coast until the end of the week, potentially bringing floods, mudslides and debris flows. ABC News\"?weather team predicts more than a half a foot of rain in Central to Northern California over the next several days. Additional rain is expected for Portland, Oregon, and Seattle. \"California will see waves of moisture on and off through Friday,\"?Golembo said.   Meanwhile, thunderstorms and damaging winds are expected to rattle Southern states, from the Gulf Coast to the Ohio Valley. The National Weather System has issued a tornado watch for portions of southern Louisiana, southern Mississippi and other parts of the region\\'s coast until 2 p.m. local time. \"severe storms are firing up already in Louisiana and Mississippi,\"?Golembo said. \"damaging winds are the biggest threat this morning.\"?  Northeastern states can expect to see rain, snow and ice this week, according to ABC News meteorologists. The first of two storms arrives today, bringing rain and ice for much of the region, with potential snowfall in Boston and other parts of New England. The icy weather moved through the Hudson Valley into southern New England this morning. By this afternoon, the snow and ice in Boston will transition to heavy rain, with some snow and ice lingering in New England and the upper Hudson Valley near Albany, New York.   ABC News meteorologists said a second storm will move into the Northeast on Thursday morning, bringing mostly snow to New York City and Boston. Heavy snowfall is in the forecast until Thursday afternoon. Some weather models are showing snow farther south in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. \"This could be a plowed event for major Northeast cities,\"?Golembo said. \"stay tuned. This is a changing forecast.\"? '],\n",

Rosie Ayliffe says the possibility of terrorism was discounted early in the investigation. \"My daughter\\'s death will not be used to further this insane persecution of innocent people,\" she wrote. Police in Australia allege that suspect Smail Ayad shouted \"Allahu akbar\" \"?an Arabic phrase meaning \"God is great\" \"?during the attack, but said there was no indication the assault was motivated by extremism. They have said they are investigating whether Ayad, who is French and was 29 years old at the time of killing, had a romantic obsession with Ayliffe-Chung. The attack took place in front of dozens of backpackers at a hostel in northern Queensland. Ayliffe-Chung was found dead at the scene. Jackson tried to stop the attack and was fatally wounded. \"This vilification of whole nation states and their people based on religion is a terrifying reminder of the horror that can ensue when we allow ourselves to be led by ignorant people into darkness and hatred,\" Ayliffe wrote.'],\n",

Last week, after Iran tested a ballistic missile, Trump tweeted that the country was \"playing with fire,\" saying they \"don\\'t appreciate how \\'kind\\' President (Barack) Obama was to them. Not me!\" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who makes the final decisions on all major policies in Iran, appeared to respond to the tweet in a remarks carried by State TV. \"Why should we be thankful to the previous U.S. administration?\" he said. \"Because it imposed anti-Iranian sanctions? Because of the extremist Islamic State group? Setting the region on fire in Iraq and Syria?\" He went on to mock Trump, saying: \"We are thankful to Mr. Newcomer, of course, since he has shown the real face of the U.S. and proved what Iran has said for 38 years about the political, economic, social and moral corruption of the U.S. government.\" He added that the Iranian people \"are not afraid of any threat.\" Trump has repeatedly criticized the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran, the U.S. and five other world powers, in which Tehran agreed to curb its uranium enrichment in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions, but he has not said what he plans to do about it. His administration said Iran was \"on notice\" over the missile test, and imposed new sanctions on more than two dozen Iranian companies and individuals. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, a moderate who has worked to improve relations with the West, said earlier Tuesday that the nuclear agreement could serve as a blueprint for resolving other Middle East disputes. As an example, he pointed to Russian-led negotiations in Kazakhstan aimed at firming up a shaky Syrian cease-fire and paving the way for the revival of peace talks to end that country\\'s nearly six-year civil war. Iran and Russia are close allies of Syrian President Bashar Assad, while the U.S. and other Western countries support the rebels fighting to topple him.'],\n",

In Escambia County, Florida -- where uniformed and plain clothed officers are increasing patrols -- the sheriff\\'s office on Monday called Boyette, 44, and Rice, 37, moving targets, saying they are believed to be moving through wooded areas and may be along the Florida and Alabama border. U.S. Marshals from across the country, along with bloodhounds and helicopters, are taking part in the search, officials said this morning. \"We have a killer in our midst,\" said Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan.     The first reported crime was on Jan. 31, in Santa Rosa County, Florida, when Alicia Greer, 30, and Jacqueline Moore, 39, were found shot to death at an inn, Morgan said. Boyette and Rice are both suspects, The Associated Press reported. Greer, a mother of three, was allegedly in an abusive relationship with Boyette, the victim\\'s father told ABC affiliate WEAR in Pensacola. Authorities say the other victims didn\"t appear to have any connection to Boyette. On Feb. 3, in nearby Baldwin County, Alabama, 52-year-old Peggy Broz was discovered shot to death in her driveway, Morgan said. Officials said today that both Boyette and Rice were involved in the fatal shooting. According to AP, investigators said the duo then stole Broz\\' car. On Feb. 6, in Escambia County, Florida, 28-year-old Kayla Crocker was shot and injured during a home invasion, they added. Crocker\\'s white Chevrolet Cobalt was stolen, and Morgan said that video surveillance showed the duo took the car.  We just received these recent pictures of Boyette and Rice.

       " ['Flu Takes a Toll in NYC With 4 Children Reported Dead in Seasonal Outbreak nan The flu season has been particularly rough in New York City this year with four pediatric deaths from the virus reported in the city, all in January, according to New York State Health Department. The flu has been spreading across the country, with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention seeing epidemic levels of flu activity late last month. There have been 15 flu-related pediatric deaths in the nation during this current flu season, the CDC reported last week. New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania all reported high levels of flu-like activity, according to a CDC flu report last week. Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said while the deaths are tragic, the New York cases are not unusual for the flu season. The New York State Department of Health did not disclose the ages of the children or whether they had been vaccinated or had an underlying condition that would have put them at additional risk for complications. \"Every year in our pediatric emergency room come children who are otherwise clearly healthy and they are seriously ill with the flu,\" Schaffner said of Vanderbilt. \"The lesson is that flu can strike even healthy children.\" During the previous flu season, a total of 89 pediatric deaths related to the flu virus were reported in the U.S., according to the CDC.     Public health experts have been concerned about vaccination rates since pediatricians may have had difficulty getting some children to get vaccinated against the flu if they have an aversion to needles, Schaffner noted. While in the past doctors could vaccinate needle-averse children with a flu mist vaccine, they were advised not to use the flu nasal spray this year, since it was found less effective than a vaccine injection. \"It\\'s clear that the substantial majority of children who die from influenza every year have not been vaccinated,\" Schaffner said, clarifying that he was speaking generally and not about the recent deaths in New York. Flu can cause symptoms of headache, fever, joint pain and cough. The seasonal flu generally spreads across the U.S. from November till March, with the peak number of cases often occurring in February. The number of people affected every year can vary widely, but generally, the CDC reports that \"millions of people are sickened, hundreds of thousands are hospitalized and thousands or tens of thousands of people die from flu every year.\" Children under the age of 1 are at increased likelihood of developing complications if they contract the flu.'],\n",

In an address to Parliament, President Klaus Iohannis, a critic of the two-month-old government, said the majority of Romanians now believed the country was going in the wrong direction. \"Romania needs a government that is transparent, which governs predictably by the light of day, not sneakily at night,\" the president said, referring to the late hour the government passed an emergency ordinance last week aimed at decriminalizing some forms of official corruption. The move \"?which bypassed Parliament and was not signed off by Iohannis, who has limited powers \"?ignited the biggest protests seen since communism ended in the country in 1989. As a result, the government will now seek to introduce the plan in Parliament. Thousands gathered for the eighth consecutive evening in Victory Square outside the government offices, shouting \"Social Democratic Party, the red plague!\" and \"Resign!\" In smaller numbers, about 2,000 protesters gathered outside the presidential palace yelling \"Get out, you traitor!\" Iohannis, who was elected in 2014 by direct vote, was chairman of the opposition Liberal Party. He quit the party that year to stand as president. He has been critical of the government headed by Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu, which came into being after the December parliamentary elections. The government \"has been saying publicly I can\\'t stomach the result of the vote ... that I\\'d overturn a legitimate government,\" Iohannis said. \"That\\'s false. You won, now govern and legislate, but not at any price.\" Some lawmakers booed and shouted \"shame on you!\" at Iohannis and walked out. Other lawmakers cheered. Despite the crisis, Iohannis said Romania didn\\'t need early elections, a view the government shares. Liviu Dragnea, chairman of the governing Social Democratic Party, and Senate speaker Calin Popescu Tariceanu refused to greet the president when he arrived at Parliament. In his speech, Iohannis pressed ahead with an earlier initiative to hold a referendum on another government initiative to pardon prisoners. Critics say the proposal will help government allies convicted of corruption. Dragnea, the main power broker behind the government, expressed disappointment Iohannis did not deliver a \"speech of unity,\" and said \"he should leave the government alone, to govern.\"'],\n",

He argued that the order, which blocks travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the country, \"will prevail [in court] and be able to take the steps necessary to protect our nation.\"     Kelly repeatedly disputed that the executive order is a Muslim ban, insisting it\\'s just a \"pause\" based on security concerns.

When asked to clarify, Kelly responded, \"Not until they act to blow something up or go into a mall and kill people.\" He continued, \"The vetting on the other end, in those seven countries, are suspect. And Mr. Trump, and certainly in my view, we have to do a pause, which he ordered. Now is under court action, so that we can take a look at what we\\'re doing on the other end.

Spicer did not offer any specific examples at the time, but said he believed that while some attacks or foiled attacks \"barely [get] coverage,\" extensive reporting has been done on some protests against the Trump administration. Included in a list of attacks that the White House provided Monday evening were the Paris attacks in November 2015, San Bernardino, in December 2015, Brussels in March 2016 and Nice, France in July 2016. Those incidents, each with multiple casualties, were among dozens of attacks the White House listed between September 2014 and December 2016. \"The point here is that these terrorist attacks are so pervasive at this point that they do not spark the wall-to-wall coverage they once did,\" a White House spokesperson said. During his brief remarks at the headquarters of the U.S. Central Command, the president seemed to make reference to his executive order banning immigration and visas from seven Muslim-majority nations that is currently the subject of a number of legal challenges. \"We need strong programs,\" he said, adding that \"people that want to destroy us and want to destroy our country\" must be kept out. Trump went on to defend NATO while simultaneously saying members of the alliance were not making \"full and proper contributions.\" Echoing President Ronald Reagan, Trump said the U.S. military should be guided by the mantra \"Peace Through Strength,\" before repeating his campaign refrain \"America First.\" '],\n",

It is important that history does not record that it was stolen in Texas.

The Patriots said Brady\\'s jersey and pads were taken off the field before the trophy ceremony Sunday night, Boston station FOX25 reported Monday morning; it appears the jersey disappeared at some point after that. This clarified an earlier Fox25 report that a team equipment manager had locked the jersey up. This morning, Brady told reporters he is still missing the jersey, saying he put it in his bag Sunday night and later it was gone. \"If it shows up on eBay somewhere, someone let me know,\" Brady said this morning. \"It\\'s unfortunate, because that\\'s a nice piece of memorabilia,\" Brady said. \"Those are pretty special ones to keep ...

The 51-50 vote ends Trump\\'s toughest confirmation battle yet. Senate Democrats debated through the night and into Tuesday morning in a last-ditch attempt to derail DeVos, buoyed by support from Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. Throughout the fight, Democrats argued they needed \"Just one more!\" to lure away another Republican vote. But Senate Republican leaders succeeded in delivering a victory to Trump in a confirmation fight that very few expected to become as tough as it did. DeVos\\' poor performance in her confirmation hearing -- punctuated by her suggestion that a school in Wyoming might want to have guns on premises to protect against grizzly bears -- contributed to roaring anger among public school supporters and teachers unions. Even before her hearing, critics pointed to DeVos\\'s lack of experience with public schools and her bankrolling of efforts like school vouchers that could take money from public institutions. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer voiced his displeasure with the vote moments after she was confirmed, tweeting, \"Today @VP Mike Pence did something no one else has ever done: cast the tie breaking vote on his own cabinet nominee.\" Devos tweeted after the vote, \"I appreciate the Senate\\'s diligence & am honored to serve as @usedgov Secretary. Let\\'s improve options & outcomes for all US students.\" Sen. Chris Murphy told CNN earlier Tuesday that DeVos seemed to have no knowledge of the federal law that protects students with disabilities. \"You put those two things together, lack of compassion for what\\'s happened to places like Sandy Hook and an inability to just understand the basic law around vulnerable students and it was clear at the end of that hearing that this was someone who shouldn\\'t be the secretary of education,\" the Connecticut Democrat said. DeVos\\' Senate vote comes after a dramatic 24 hours of protest from Democrats inside and outside the Capitol that lasted through the night, into Tuesday morning, with Democratic senators taking shifts in the Senate arguing against DeVos. The delay tactics have succeeded in stalling many of Trump\\'s most important Cabinet picks -- but Senate Republican leaders promised Monday to get votes for four nominees this week: DeVos, Health and Human Services nominee Tom Price, Treasury pick Steven Mnuchin and attorney general nominee, Sen. Jeff Sessions. Meanwhile, with each passing day, more questions have been raised about Trump\\'s Cabinet picks.

The views expressed in this commentary are her own. The limited scope of DeVos\\' education policy experience has raised questions for many about whether she is suited to run the federal agency charged with making American public education first-rate for all children. But there is another subterranean element to this debate, which now should be surfaced, especially given our racially charged environment and the role that segregated schools have long played in our politics. Racial animus was a primary catalyst of the move toward private and religious K-12 education almost 50 years ago, and racial segregation remains a dominant factor in all schooling, public and private, today. DeVos\\' track record suggests that as secretary, she will do little to combat these trends. In the wake of the 1954 Brown v. Board Supreme Court decision, which famously declared that separate schools for black and white children were not equal, the federal government began -- albeit slowly -- to desegregate. This applied to schools in the South that were previously forbidden by law from educating children of different races together and to schools in the North plagued by de facto segregation. The backlash, now infamous but perhaps too familiar even today, was fierce. From Alabama Governor George Wallace\\'s stance in the schoolhouse door and his proclamations of \"segregation now, segregation forever\" to Louise Day Hicks leading the Boston antibusing movement, the reaction to desegregation roiled American politics. But the Brown ruling did not apply to private schools. Thus, an estimated half-million white students left public schools between 1964 and 1975 to enroll in schools that were known as \"segregation academies.\" This move to private schools was part of a larger \"white flight\" movement. White flight was one of the greatest demographic shifts in American history. Millions of whites nationwide moved out of cities and into racially isolated suburbs. Scholar Kevin Kruse has called white flight \"the most successful segregationist response to the moral demands of the civil rights movement and the legal authority of the courts.\" The character and quality of most American schools today, like the neighborhoods in which they are found and which they shape, have a racial past. Now, American public schools are falling back into a kind of racial segregation that is reminiscent of our country before Brown. In the last 25 years, the number of severely racially isolated schools, defined as those with 0-10% white students, has tripled. In 2010 in New York City, 92% of black students and 88% of Latino students attended schools that were majority-minority, some of which see such severely racialized and concentrated poverty that they are dubbed \"apartheid schools.\" In DeVos\\'s own state of Michigan, which has seen two decades of charter school growth, enrollment and funding for public schools has waned while schools have become increasingly segregated. Nor does public funding for private schools, which DeVos advocates, seem to achieve much good for students of color. Voucher and other public funding programs are marketed as appealing because tax dollars \"follow the child.\" But research over the past fifteen years shows that private schools are even more racially segregated than public schools. This has negative consequences for both white students and students of color. Research shows that both black children who attend desegregated schools end up with more income, higher wages and better long-term health, with no negative effects on white students. Further, a range of studies strongly suggest that desegregated schools educate all children such that they can better contribute to American society and to a healthier American economy. It is therefore both a moral outrage and an economic mistake that so much of the current movement in favor of school choice and religious education carries the stain of racial animosity, even in dog-whistle form. Of course, many private and religious schools are excellent and inclusive places of learning. But let\\'s not be fooled. School choice is not really about freedom. Freedom, of course, is a bedrock American value. But the kind of \"freedom\" associated with the flight away from integration and toward racial isolation will never lead to a more truly free United States. So as senators consider DeVos\\' nomination to oversee public education for every American child, they would do well to remember the deepest values of public schooling, as well as the deeper meaning of appointing a Secretary of Education associated with a more exclusive and racially exclusionary vision.'],\n",
       " ['Trump \\'shows true face of US,\\' says Iran\\'s Supreme Leader (CNN)Iran\\'s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Tuesday that he\\'s grateful to President Donald Trump for showing \"the true face of the US.\" Khamenei told a gathering of Iran\\'s air force commanders in Tehran that the new US administration has shown the world \"the depth of corruption in US government,\" according to quotes published by Iran\\'s semi-official MEHR news agency. Khamenei reportedly told the commanders: \"We however thank this new guy in the White House, since he largely did the job we had been trying to do in the past decades: to divulge the true face of the US. We had been working to show the world the depth of corruption in US government and ranks and files of the ruling elite; Trump did it in few days after coming to the White House.\" He added: \"Their claims to human rights are no longer tenable.\" Khamenei also made an apparent reference to the five-year-old son of an Iranian mother who was detained at a US airport following Trump\\'s ban on visas for seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iran. According to Iran\\'s official news agency, IRNA, the Ayatollah said: \"Presently, too, by embarking on such actions, like putting handcuffs on a five-year-old kid, he [Trump] is demonstrating the reality behind the American human rights.\" Khamenei\\'s comments come amid escalating tensions between Iran and the US since Trump became president. The travel ban and sanctions enacted by the Trump administration, coupled with missile testing by Iran, have contributed to the deteriorating relationship. Concerns have been raised over the future of a deal, brokered by the Obama administration, that requires Iran to heavily restrict its nuclear program. On Saturday, a day after the Trump administration imposed fresh sanctions over an Iranian ballistic missile test, US Defense Secretary James Mattis called Iran \"the single biggest state sponsor of terrorism in the world.\" Two days earlier, Trump had tweeted that \"Iran has been formally PUT ON NOTICE\" and should have been \"thankful\" for the \"terrible deal\" brokered by the Obama administration. He declined to rule out military action against Iran. But a senior Iranian adviser to the Ayatollah, Ali Akbar Velayati, dismissed Trump\\'s remarks as \"baseless ranting.\" And this is not the first time that the Ayatollah has spoken in such terms about the US President. In November, during the election race, Khamenei lambasted both Trump and Hillary Clinton for revealing what he called the moral shortcomings of the US.'],\n",
       " ['Al Qaeda leader mocks Trump after Yemen raid (CNN)Days after a raid on an al Qaeda compound in Yemen led to the first US military combat death under Donald Trump, the leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula released an audio message taunting the new American President. In an 11-minute recording, AQAP leader Qassim al-Rimi condemned the January 29 raid, saying, \"The new fool of the White House received a painful slap across his face.\" The message was released online Saturday and translated by the SITE Intelligence Group. In the recording, Rimi also claimed \"dozens of Americans were killed and wounded,\" a number starkly at odds with the US account, which reported the death of one Navy SEAL, Chief Petty Officer William \"Ryan\" Owens. Three additional SEALs also were wounded. Rimi acknowledged the deaths of 14 men and 11 women and children in the raid, a joint counterterrorism effort between the United States and United Arab Emirates. A senior US military official told CNN on Monday that Rimi was a target of the operation. The recording was released after last week\\'s raid. Trump is using Obama as a security blanket Civilian deaths Reportedly among the dead was the 8-year-old the daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, the late US-born cleric who directed attacks against the United States. Awlaki was killed in 2011. Reprieve, a London-based nongovernmental organization, and a Sanaa-based human rights worker told CNN that at least 23 civilians were killed in the attack. \"When the Americans escaped, they dragged their killed and wounded, and they found no other alternative but to destroy their own planes so that it would not be proof of their scandal,\" Rimi said. The senior US military official told CNN on Monday that intelligence collection wasn\\'t the only objective of the Yemen raid but that it had also targeted Rimi. In the event Rimi wasn\\'t there, the US military believed it would find intelligence that would help lead to him, the official said. Green-lighting the mission was not dependent on al-Rimi being there, however, a senior US military official emphasized. But US Central Command, which oversees forces in the region, had strongly disputed that Rimi was the objective of the raid more than a week ago. \"It wasn\\'t a high-value target mission,\" Col. John Thomas told CNN, referring to operations aimed at killing or capturing terrorist leaders. Thomas added no hard intelligence indicated a \"high possibility\" Rimi was at the compound on the night of the raid, saying that Navy SEALs would have captured any leaders of the al Qaeda affiliate, including Rimi, as part of an intelligence-gathering operation. \"Anyone found on site would have been taken,\" Thomas said. NBC first reported that Rimi was a target of the raid. The chance to take out such a pivotal member of al Qaeda may explain the large allocation of resources used in the mission. Military botches release of video seized in Yemen raid Raid missteps Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula fighters detected the SEAL team before it reached its objective, leading to an intense firefight. Following news of the raid, the military had said the goal of the mission was to gather intelligence on the al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen. On Friday, the Pentagon released clips from an al Qaeda training video seized during the raid but later pulled them because the video was nearly a decade old. Government officials previously told CNN plans for the raid had been in the works for months and that Trump green-lighted the mission shortly after his inauguration. How Donald Trump\\'s first military action went from the Obama White House to deadly raid The Pentagon said the battle resulted in the deaths of 14 al Qaeda fighters, including two AQAP leaders. Many observers have considered al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula among the most dangerous, if not the most dangerous, branch of al Qaeda since its formation in 2009. Rimi reportedly became its leader following a 2015 drone strike that killed Nasir al-Wuhayshi.'],\n",
       " ['Trump teeing up a softer diplomatic approach with Japan Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump is turning on the charm. Or at least, he\\'s turning on his golf cart. After a combative round of telephone diplomacy with even the staunchest US allies, the commander in chief is planning a more genial approach this week when he decamps with Japan\\'s Prime Minister to his winter getaway in Florida for a round of golf. He\\'s not likely to instruct Shinzo Abe how to dance the Cotton-Eyed Joe, the way George W. Bush did when Vladimir Putin visited his Crawford, Texas, ranch. Nor is he hoping to replicate the courtside bro-out Barack Obama enjoyed with David Cameron at a March Madness game in Ohio. But in bringing Abe to his ornate southern retreat Mar-a-Lago, Trump is nonetheless continuing a long tradition of presidents melding recreation and negotiation in their encounters with foreign leaders. Trump, who is still seeking his diplomatic footing three weeks into his term, finds himself more relaxed at his oceanfront oasis than in the White House, where he\\'s lived for less than a month. He hopes the gesture will also put the buttoned-up Abe at ease. \"That\\'s the one thing about golf -- you get to know somebody better on a golf course than you will over lunch,\" Trump told a radio interviewer over the weekend. The President has told aides he hopes to use golf and visits to Mar-a-Lago as a way to develop warmer ties with his foreign counterparts, many of whom are approaching his presidency with uncertainty. Trump, who prefers to sleep in his own bed, has expressed little interest so far in traveling abroad, though he\\'s committed to attending a European NATO summit in May and accepted an invitation from Britain\\'s Queen Elizabeth II for a state visit this summer. RELATED: Theresa May in trouble over Trump\\'s UK state visit invite At Mar-a-Lago, Trump is happy to play host. Overlooking the Atlantic on Florida\\'s Gold Coast, the club is firmly Trump\\'s turf. On his first trip there as president last weekend, he mingled in the club\\'s living room with paying members even as a Washington state judge halted his controversial immigration order. Friends say Trump is most relaxed in the confines of his estate -- or playing golf on the courses he owns nearby. \"He\\'s able to relax on the golf course with people he knows and trusts and likes,\" said Robin Bernstein, one of Mar-a-Lago\\'s original members, who speaks with Trump frequently when he\\'s staying in Florida. \"I think that he finds golf kind of his outlet to relax. He loves it, he enjoys it, he\\'s a fabulous athlete, and that\\'s what he loves. Some people go fishing -- Donald loves golf.\" In Abe, Trump finds a leader eager to foster a closer bond with the US, particularly given Trump\\'s tough criticism of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, which Japan was a partner in, and the costs of US security support provided to the East Asian nation. \"This is a testament to the importance the United States places on the bilateral relationship and the strength of our alliance and the deep economic ties between the United States and Japan,\" White House press secretary Sean Spicer said on Tuesday after detailing the weekend trip. Abe enjoyed a congenial working relationship with Obama, but the two men never developed warm personal ties. When Abe tried bringing Obama to Tokyo\\'s best sushi restaurant in 2014, the US president grew restless as the dinner stretched for hours. Abe is hoping to start fresh with Trump, already meeting once with the real estate mogul in November. The pair discussed bilateral ties in Trump\\'s Louis XIV-style livingroom at Trump Tower in Manhattan. Abe brought along a gold-colored golf driver as a gift. \"I know he loves the game, and we\\'re going to have a lot of fun,\" Trump said in the radio interview this week. \"I\\'ll just make sure he\\'s my partner.\" Trump\\'s invitation for a weekend at his private club continues a well-established practice of vacation diplomacy for US presidents. His predecessors have acted both as hosts for their foreign counterparts and as guests at vacation spots and golf courses the world over. But no recent president has owned as lavish a getaway home as Trump, or been so eager to show it off. Obama, who maintained a residence in Chicago but rarely visited there himself, employed public properties instead to host foreign leaders away from the White House. Obama invited the new Chinese President Xi Jinping to the Sunnylands estate in Southern California for their first meeting, including a long ramble in scalding desert heat around the grounds. He used Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland\\'s Catoctin Mountains, to reassure Arab Gulf leaders of his Iran nuclear deal in 2015. Accustomed to more lavish environs, leaders like Saudi King Salman sent top advisers instead. More relaxing were his encounters with Cameron. After Obama flew him to Dayton for the NCAA tournament in 2012, Cameron reciprocated with a round of golf at the Grove Club in Hertfordshire. He was one of the few foreign leaders who joined Obama for golf -- others included the Prime Ministers of New Zealand and Malaysia. Bush, who swore off golf shortly after the start of the Iraq War, hosted more than a dozen leaders among the scrub brush at his Crawford ranch. His three-day summit there with Putin in 2001 featured line dancing and a barbecue, but little agreement on missile defense. A session with the Saudi King resulted in some awkward photos of the President holding the Gulf monarch\\'s hand. Bill Clinton used Camp David to try securing an agreement between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat at the end of his term. He wasn\\'t successful; the wooded retreat proved less inspiring than it had 20 years earlier, when Jimmy Carter brokered a successful peace accord there between Israel and Egypt. Like Trump, Clinton identified golf as an entry point into personal relationships with counterparts. A round in 2000 with Singapore\\'s Prime Minister in Brunei started late and stretched well past midnight. American leaders aren\\'t alone in using quieter retreats as a setting for talks. When Obama visited Saudi Arabia in 2014, then-King Abdullah received him at his desert getaway oasis, Rawdat Khurayim, 35 miles outside Riyadh. Trump, too, could soon find himself at another leader\\'s vacation home when he travels to Britain -- though not necessarily to make him more comfortable. Alex Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, suggested this week that Trump\\'s visit to the United Kingdom may take place at Balmoral, the Queen\\'s Scotland estate, to evade the expected masses of protesters in London. The palace later tamped down that speculation, noting the Aberdeenshire castle was privately owned by the royal family, and thus unsuitable for a state visit. But of the Queen\\'s other official residences, two -- Windsor Castle, outside London, and Holyroodhouse, in Edinburgh -- would at least move Trump away from the capital.'],\n",
       " ['Journalists call out White House claims on terror reporting (CNN)Journalists are calling out a White House claim that news outlets are failing to adequately report terror attacks. On Monday, the White House issued a list of 78 terror attacks to underscore President Donald Trump\\'s assertion that the media is failing to adequately report them. Trump told enlisted service-members at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida that attacks were happening \"all over Europe\" and that \"it\\'s gotten to a point where it\\'s not even being reported.\" \"And in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn\\'t want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that,\" Trump added. Later, the White House distributed a list of the attacks Trump was citing, saying \"most did not receive adequate attention.\" \"Below is a list of 78 major terrorist attacks targeting the West that were executed or inspired by ISIS since September 2014, soon after the terror group declared its caliphate. Most of these attacks did not receive adequate attention from Western media sources,\" a White House official said on background, when distributing the list. But reporters in print, on air and on social media have robustly covered many of those attacks and terror in general. \"As a journalist I\\'m really troubled by that,\" Washington Post columnist David Ignatius said on CNN\\'s \"The Lead\" on Monday, responding to Trump\\'s initial statement. \"We have brave colleagues who everyday are taking big risks to cover these stories. Look at The New York Times, which the President demonizes often. The New York Times this weekend had an outstanding piece of reporting about how ISIS has been reaching out, is more involved in some attacks in Europe and abroad,\" he said. Ignatius said he has about 100 examples of strong reporting he\\'d like to show the President. CNN\\'s Anderson Cooper also highlighted his coverage of many of the events listed. \"Not only did we cover many of the attacks on that list the White House has released, we covered them heavily. I know because I was there on the ground reporting a number of them,\" he said Monday night, before showing footage of himself reporting from Ottawa, Canada, in 2014; Paris in November 2015; San Bernardino, California, in 2015; in Orlando, Florida, in June 2016. He added: \"To be sure, we as a program did not cover each and every incident on the list, however other programs, as well as CNN International covered most if not all of them, many of them exhaustively.\" The attacks listed span from September 2014 to December 2016, and include the Paris attacks, the Orlando nightclub shooting, the truck attacks in Nice and Berlin, the Brussels airport attack, the Istanbul airport and Sultanahmet attacks, and the Sydney siege. But the White House only mentions attacks that appear to have been carried out with Islamist motives and omits other terror operations. It does not mention the recent attack on a mosque in Quebec City, or the racially motivated attack by Dylann Roof on a church in South Carolina, in which nine black worshipers were shot dead. White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters after Trump\\'s statement that the President \"felt as though members of the media don\\'t always cover some of those events to the extent that other events might get covered; that a protest will get blown out of the water, and yet an attack or a foiled attack doesn\\'t necessarily get the same coverage.\" Trump has used terror attacks to justify his controversial temporary ban on citizens from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the US. He has also repeatedly referred to media organizations critical of him as \"fake news.\"'],\n",
       " ['Trump travel ban oral arguments: what you need to know (CNN)Three federal judges on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals are set to hear oral arguments at 6 p.m. ET Tuesday in the challenge to President Donald Trump\\'s travel ban. The lawsuit, brought by attorneys general of Washington and Minnesota, has captivated the nation since last Friday when a federal district court judge put a stop to Trump\\'s executive order restricting travel for foreign nationals, and as a result, temporarily opened US borders to immigrants once again. The hearing will be by telephone and livestreamed; here\\'s what to listen for: What\\'s the hearing about? US District Court Judge James Robart upended Trump\\'s executive order nationwide Friday by temporarily halting the key provisions restricting travel for foreign nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries (Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen) and refugee admissions. The central question for the appellate court is whether Robart abused his discretion by putting a temporary hold on the travel ban. No court has addressed the constitutionality of the executive order thus far. The players The attorney general of Washington state, Bob Ferguson, filed the case and was later joined by the attorney general of Minnesota, Lori Swanson. The suit is being defended by lawyers at the Civil Division of the Department of Justice in Washington, DC. The randomly assigned three-judge panel includes Judge William C. Canby Jr, an appointee of President Jimmy Carter; Judge Michelle T. Friedland; who was appointed by President Barack Obama; and Judge Richard R. Clifton, an appointee of President George W. Bush. When is this hearing? The appellate court has set an hour-long telephonic oral argument in the case for Tuesday at 6 p.m. ET. It will be available for live streaming through the court\\'s website. Each side will get 30 minutes to make their case. What are the states saying? On Monday attorneys for the states that filed the lawsuit submitted their brief urging the appellate court to keep the travel ban suspension in place. The states say that the temporary restraining order should remain in place because the President had \"unleashed chaos\" by signing the order. They also argue that the government\\'s claim -- that it would be \"irreparably harmed\" by keeping Robart\\'s temporary suspension order in place while the case proceeds to the merits -- doesn\\'t make any sense. To accept DOJ\\'s position, they argue, \"would mean that until the (Executive) Order was issued, Defendants were suffering some, unspecified, ongoing irreparable harm. That makes no sense. ...Preserving the status quo against sudden disruption is often in the interest of all parties.\" What is the Trump administration\\'s argument? The government submitted its own brief in response Monday evening. DOJ continues to emphasize that the states do not have the ability to sue in this case and a district court judge does not have the right to second-guess the President\\'s national security judgment in the immigration context. But the government also raised a fallback argument in its latest court filing -- suggesting if the appellate court is inclined to uphold the Seattle district court\\'s decision, then it must at least limit it to the class of people who have been previously admitted to the US -- like someone traveling on a student visa. In the government\\'s view, aliens outside of the US who have never stepped foot on US soil have no constitutional right to enter the US. What happens next? The judges have a number of different options at their disposal to resolve this case, but it is unlikely that they would rule on whether the ban is constitutional (since that is not the question before them) -- the central issue is whether the executive order should remain suspended for now. For example, the judges could dismiss DOJ\\'s request for a stay of Robart\\'s decision because, as the government acknowledges, temporary restraining orders are generally not appealable, or they could uphold his ruling -- but under either scenario the suspension of the ban would remain in place while the case moves forward with further scheduled hearings. Alternatively, the appellate court could find Robart abused his discretion and overreached to include classes of people not protected under the Constitution (e.g., aliens living abroad) -- in which case the travel ban would go back into effect. After the three-judge panel publishes its decision, the losing party has 14 days to file a petition for rehearing the case by the full appellate court (but is not required to do so in order to get the case in front of the Supreme Court). Given the high stakes involved in this lawsuit, it is expected that whoever ultimately loses before the Ninth Circuit will most likely appeal to the Supreme Court. At the moment, there are only eight justices on the court, meaning if there is a 4-4 split then the Ninth Circuit\\'s ruling will be the law of the land.'],\n",
       " ['People appalled by corruption bill, Romanian President says (CNN)The President of Romania has attacked the country\\'s government in a speech in Parliament, saying \"Romanians are appalled\" over the corruption bill scandal that has rocked the country in recent days. President Klaus Iohannis said it is time for Romania to decide whether it wants to be a \"strong prosperous\" nation or a \"weak despised one\" -- and he called for a referendum so the people can have their say. Half a million citizens took to the streets on Sunday in the largest of a series of demonstrations over a bill that would have protected many politicians from being prosecuted for corruption. The Social Democrat-led government announced that day in a statement that it was repealing the decree, which had been approved last week without input from Parliament. However, Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu indicated that he still planned to push through the amendments to the criminal codes via legislation that would be put to Parliament for approval. Protests continued over the issue Monday night -- albeit on a smaller scale -- with calls for the government to be removed. \\'Transparent government\\' In his speech on Tuesday, Iohannis, a former National Liberal Party politician, said withdrawing the decree is too little. Although he stopped short of calling for a fresh election, he told members of the center-left government, which has been in power since December, \"Your first worry was to take care of the files of the convicted (politicians). Romanians are appalled. \"The withdrawal of Ordnance 13 is too little. Early elections, at this point, is too much. Who needs to come up with a solution? The Social Democrats, as they created the problem.\" At this point, members of the governing coalition -- made up of the Social Democrats and a smaller party, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats, walked out of the room. \"Are you already tired?\" asked the President. \"Too bad. Romania needs a strong government, a transparent one, whose governing is predictable, done in broad daylight, not stealthily at night.\" He went on to ask, \"What kind of nation do we want to be? Do we want to be a strong, prosperous one, which builds a rule of law and respects it, where justice is strong and independent? Or do we want to be a weak nation, despised, which risks everything to save a few from difficult times?\" This, he said, would be the \"question and the purpose\" of a referendum, which would \"really find out the will of the Romanian people.\" Demonstrations continue Around 25,000 demonstrators gathered in Victory Square, Bucharest, on Monday evening and around 20,000 elsewhere in the country, according to estimates by the Romanian media. Although they turned out in far smaller numbers than Sunday, they continued to call for the government to resign. A counter-demonstration with about 3,000 people gathered outside the presidential palace in support of the government, calling for Iohannis to resign. Speaking to CNN on Tuesday, Vlad Mixich, a Romanian journalist and political commentator, said of the President\\'s address to Parliament, \"He talked mainly to the people who protested in the last week in the streets. I think it was important for him to do that. \"This was one of the biggest protests in Romania since (the fall of communism in) 1989. So he had to speak directly to those people who were in the streets to protest even if the protesters don\\'t perceive the President as their leader\".\" Mixich said the referendum suggested by the President \"would be a symbolic gesture. One of the type that politicians love so much -- it will keep this topic on the table.\" A brighter future \"The protests won\\'t stop until some of the ministers will quit their jobs. We\\'ve had enough of them,\" said Bianca Dumitru, 25, a sports journalist who joined protests in her home town of Brasov, central Romania. \"The last week was incredible for the whole country. We got so united and motivated that we have to thank the government for this. But I think it\\'s time for them to let us enjoy the victory and live in a prosperous environment, with a bright future ahead.\" Parliament is due on Wednesday to debate a censure motion submitted by the opposition in a bid to remove the government from office. This is not expected to succeed, as the coalition holds a majority in the legislative body.'],\n",

Before returning to Washington, the former president dove into an aquatic and athletic challenge with his friend, Virgin Group founder and billionaire Richard Branson, while vacationing on the British Virgin Islands with former first lady Michelle Obama. Now that Obama is free from many Secret Service-imposed restrictions that did not allow him to partake in activities like surfing, Branson offered Obama the chance to learn how to kitesurf. But to make things more interesting, Branson took on a challenge of his own. \"We decided to set up a friendly challenge: Could Barack learn to kitesurf before I learned to foilboard? We agreed to have a final day battle to see who could stay up the longest,\" Branson wrote in a post on Virgin.com. Kitesurfing is riding on a surfboard while holding onto a kite and foilboarding is riding a surfboard with a hydrofoil that goes into the water lifts the board above the surface. Following a few days of training, the challenge was on and Obama kitesurfed his way to victory. \"We were neck and neck until the last run on the last day, when I got up on the foilboard and screamed along for over 50 metres, three feet above the water,\" Branson wrote. \"I was feeling very pleased with myself, only to look over and see Barack go 100 metres on his kiteboard! I had to doff my cap to him and celebrate his victory.\"'],\n",
       " ['Male contraceptive gel effective in monkeys, but will it work in humans? (CNN)When it comes to contraception, there are no long-lasting, easily reversible options for men. The only choices are condoms or a vasectomy. And it\\'s been this way for more than a century. But a new injectable gel that blocks sperm inside the body, preventing them from leaving while allowing seminal fluid to pass through, has proved effective in trials using monkeys. The researchers behind the product, known as Vasalgel, hope it could get trials in humans within a few years. \"What was important here was that this worked and was safe in animals similar to humans,\" said Elaine Lissner, executive director of the Parsemus Foundation, the medical research organization behind Vasalgel that is also leading the trials. A new study, published Tuesday, involved 16 male monkeys receiving injections of Vasalgel who were released into social outdoor housing with females. Any adverse effects, as well as their ability to impregnate females, was compared with a historical sample of monkeys that had received vasectomies. \"It was a simple efficacy study,\" Lissner said, meaning the researchers merely set out to see whether the gel was safe and worked to prevent pregnancy. The social groups were monitored for at least one breeding season, and the team reported in its paper that none of the females in the group conceived during that time. One monkey had the gel inserted incorrectly, and another developed a sperm granuloma, or lump of sperm, but the majority tolerated the gel and saw little inflammation, Lissner said, adding that rates of granuloma and inflammation are usually higher after a vasectomy. Lissner\\'s team is hoping to conduct clinical trials in humans next year and plans to stage further animal trials this year in preparation. But although the gel worked well in monkeys, it won\\'t necessarily translate perfectly to humans. \"This is a bigger, longer task than we first anticipated,\" Lissner said. Stopping sperm in their tracks Administering Vasalgel inside a man, or a monkey, involves a polymer injected into the sperm-carrying tubes between the testicles and penis, known as the vas deferens, to block sperm as they are released. The injection is given under anesthetic and mimics the effect of a vasectomy, but without the snip. \"It\\'s a sticky gel that goes into (the tubes) and basically filters out sperm,\" Lissner said. A similar polymer called RISUG is being trialled in India and has proved effective in men. The new gel is injected in a location similar to that cut during a vasectomy and allows fluids through while blocking sperm. The backed-up sperm are then reabsorbed by the body. A further benefit is that -- unlike with a vasectomy -- the gel is meant to disintegrate when a second solution is injected to break down the barrier and flush it out. This would make the process reversible. Reversibility was shown in trials on rabbits, but it was not tested in the new trial on monkeys. Recent trials on baboons also failed to reverse the effect. \"Successful reversibility will be the key to make this world-changing,\" Lissner said. Invasive procedure A further factor likely to impact numbers using this method is that Vasalgel still involves minor surgery to pull out the sperm tubes and inject the gel. What\\'s more, when sperm are reabsorbed into the body, there is a risk of an immune reaction, potentially leaving men less fertile after reversal -- similar to vasectomy, though risks with the gel are lower, according to Lissner. \"Fifty percent of men after a vasectomy reversal remain infertile,\" said Dr. Ilpo Huhtaniemi, emeritus professor of reproductive endocrinology at Imperial College London, who was not involved in the new study. However, he points out that this doesn\\'t prevent men from having children, as sperm can still be collected and used for in-vitro fertilization. The latest evidence on monkeys has many hoping a new form of contraceptive may be on the horizon, but experts believe more evidence is first needed on its reversibility. \"In order for it to have a chance of replacing the traditional surgical method of vasectomy, the authors need to show that the procedure is reversible, and it\\'s reassuring that apparently such studies are ongoing,\" said Allan Pacey, professor of andrology at the University of Sheffield who was also not involved in the new research. \"The idea of trying to replace the traditional method of vasectomy by inserting a gel into the tube which carries sperm from the testicles to the penis at ejaculation is not a new one. However, we haven\\'t seen much progress in developing the idea in recent years, so this study is a useful step in the right direction.\" A male hormonal birth control injection was shown to prevent pregnancy in a 2016 study but was ended early due to side effects. Other approaches have involved strategies to control the production of sperm by targeting the hormone testosterone, but this had side effects of depression and weight gain. In 2015, Japanese scientists discovered a protein, calcineurin, found to be crucial in helping sperm swim and break through the membrane of a female egg in order to fertilize it.

Doctors in the hospital where Vladimir Kara-Murza, 35, is being treated say they still \"have no real idea\" what caused his illness, but agree a \"toxic substance\" is to blame, his lawyer Vadim Prokhorov told CNN. Kara-Murza\\'s wife, Yevgenia, told CNN that doctors have tried to bring her husband out of a medically-induced coma but that when they did so, he \"had almost no reaction at all, except to his name being called.\" He is currently on dialysis and artificial ventilation. She said doctors have diagnosed him with \"acute intoxication by an unidentified substance\" and that there is \"no prognosis,\" adding that the risks are now more serious due to his previous illness. Prokhorov told CNN that an investigator from the Khamovniki district of Moscow contacted him last Friday to inquire about the circumstances which led to Kara-Murza\\'s hospitalization, but has not received any further updates about the ongoing investigation. \"The problem is that they are not paying any real attention to this,\" Prokhorov said. \"The investigative committee is only interested in this situation because of the media coverage.\" He said he has no direct proof his client was poisoned. The Kremlin has denied any involvement in Kara-Murza\\'s 2015 illness. Moscow denies involvement in 2015 health scare CNN spoke to Kara-Murza in 2015, months after a mysterious illness nearly killed him. \"I fell into a coma, all of my major organs began failing, one after another. It was the kidneys first, then the lungs, the heart, the liver,\" he said at the time. He said he believed his 2015 suspected poisoning was a politically motivated attack. \"Frankly there is no other possible reason,\" he said. \"I don\\'t have any money dealings. I don\\'t have any personal enemies. I didn\\'t steal anybody\\'s wife.\" The case had parallels with the killing of former Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko in London. A British public inquiry into that 2006 poisoning found two former Russian agents responsible for carrying out the poisoning with the radioactive isotope Polonium-210. Its final report concluded that Putin was \"probably\" aware of the operation. The Russian Foreign Ministry dismissed the UK inquiry as politically motivated and the Kremlin said Russia wasn\\'t involved. In February 2015, a leading Russian opposition figure and friend of Kara-Murza, Boris Nemtsov, was shot to death on a bridge near the Kremlin as he walked home from a restaurant. Kara-Murza became ill four months later. US lawmakers urge investigation Kara-Murza\\'s hospitalization has triggered an outcry from US lawmakers, who have called on the Trump administration to speak out on his behalf. US Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, said Putin should be held accountable if there is evidence the government poisoned Kara-Murza. \"Vladimir Putin does not deserve any benefit of the doubt here, given how commonplace political assassinations and poisonings have become under his regime,\" said Rubio, a frequent Putin critic. \"I am praying that Kara-Murza\\'s condition improves.\" He urged the White House and the State Department to question Russian authorities about the case. Kara-Murza, who splits his time between Russia and his family home in Virginia, is a dual Russian-British citizen. He is part of the Open Russia foundation, an organization of anti-Putin activists who call for open elections, a free press and civil rights reforms. When he fell ill last week, Kara-Murza was touring Russia for screenings of a documentary about Nemtsov.'],\n",
       " ['New law lets husbands sue wives to stop abortion - even in rape cases (CNN)A new Arkansas law will let a husband sue a doctor to stop his wife from getting an abortion. And it makes no exception for cases of spousal rape. The law, called the Arkansas Unborn Child Protection From Dismemberment Abortion Act, was passed and signed by Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, and goes into effect later this year. It prohibits dismemberment abortion, the most common procedure used in second-trimester abortions. A clause in the law states that the husband of a woman getting the abortion can sue the doctor to stop his wife\\'s abortion. The husband has to be the father of the child. And because there\\'s no exemption in the law for rape or incest, a woman\\'s rapist could theoretically file suit to stop the abortion. The ACLU of Arkansas claims the law is unconstitutional and plans to challenge it in court before it goes into effect. One Arkansas lawmaker said there wasn\\'t much debate about those parts of the law. \"It was not something that was talked about on the Senate floor,\" Arkansas state Sen. Joyce Elliott told CNN affiliate KARK. \"If we cannot make headway on something like an exception for rape and incest, I think it just felt kind of fruitless to make some sense out of the rest of what was in the bill.\" Elliott added, \"They don\\'t see the outrage in constantly putting the thumb on women to dictate what they can do and not do.\" But another lawmaker believes husbands should have a voice in these decisions. \"I think a woman does have control over her own body, but when you have created a life, you created a life with someone else,\" said state Sen. Missy Irvin. Kansas and Oklahoma passed similar abortion laws which are tied up in the courts, according to CNN affiliate KFSM. A few states, with conservative lawmakers emboldened by Donald Trump\\'s election, have passed strict new abortion laws, including Ohio, which passed a measure banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy.'],\n",

       " ['Chinese ships sail near disputed Japanese islands (CNN)Three Chinese Coast Guard ships entered waters near a chain of islands claimed by both China and Japan in the East China Sea on Monday, according to authorities from both sides. Japan controls the chain and calls them the Senkaku Islands, while China calls them the Diaoyu Islands. The sailing comes just days after US Defense Secretary James Mattis reaffirmed America\\'s commitment to defending Japan and its disputed islands. According to Japanese broadcaster NHK, protests were lodged with the Chinese Embassy in Tokyo and in Beijing through the Japanese Embassy. Tensions have flashed numerous times in recent years over the disputed islands,-including face-offs between Japanese and Chinese air and naval forces-that have been termed dangerous by both sides. EXPLAINER: How an uninhabited island chain split Japan and China China\\'s State Oceanic Administration, which oversees the country\\'s Coast Guard, put out a statement late Monday saying the three ships \"cruised within China\\'s Diaoyu Islands territorial sea.\" China\\'s Defense Ministry, which is separate from the Oceanic Administration, posted a statement on its website confirming the Coast Guard ship movement. Japan\\'s Coast Guard said the Chinese vessels spent two hours in Japanese territorial waters. It was the fourth time Chinese ships have entered Japan\\'s waters this year, the Japanese Coast Guard said. There were 36 such incidents in 2016, it said. Despite the frequency of the Chinese sailings, experts said having one so soon after Mattis\\' visit to Japan sent a subtle message to both Tokyo and Washington. \"It is both a signal that China won\\'t be intimidated from defending its interests/claims and a test to see how the new (Trump) administration responds,\" said Carl Schuster, a professor at Hawaii Pacific University and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command\\'s Joint Intelligence Center. Denny Roy, an Asian security expert at the East-West Center in Honolulu, said ship movements in disputed waters could result in a shooting incident. \"The danger is especially high considering military personnel on both sides are often eager to demonstrate their determination to defend what they consider national territory,\" Roy said. And a China-Japan military confrontation could bring US forces into play. During a press conference Saturday in Tokyo, Mattis said the US would defend the islands with Japan. \"I made clear that our long-standing policy on the Senkaku Islands stands -- the US will continue to recognize Japanese administration of the islands and as such Article 5 of the US-Japan Security Treaty applies,\" Mattis said in an appearance with Japanese Defense Minister Tomomi Inada. The US position was reinforced Tuesday in a phone call between Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and the new US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, according to a statement from Japan\\'s Foreign Ministry. \"The United States will be against any unilateral action made to damage the Japanese administration of the Senkaku Islands,\" Tillerson stated during the call, according to the Japanese statement. China responded quickly on Saturday to the US stance on the islands, saying it brings instability to the region. \"Diaoyu and its affiliated islands have been Chinese territory since ancient times. These are historical facts that cannot be changed. The so-called US-Japan security treaty was a product of the Cold War, and it should not harm China\\'s territorial sovereignty and legitimate rights,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said in a statement. \"We urge the US side to adopt a responsible attitude and stop making wrong remarks on the issue of the sovereignty of Diaoyu Islands,\" Lu said. The US commitment to the Senkakus is not new. In 2014, the Obama administration also said the remote chain fell under the treaty. In late 2013, China-declared an air defense identification zone (ADIZ) over much of the East China Sea, including the Senkakus, despite objections from Tokyo and Washington. Japan also has an ADIZ over the islands. Although the Senkakus are uninhabited, their ownership would allow for exclusive oil, mineral and fishing rights in the surrounding waters. While the Senkakus remain a source of friction in the US-China relationship, Mattis\\' visit seemed to have soothed relations a bit in another area, the South China Sea. Although the US defense chief said \"China has shredded the trust of nations in the region\" by fortifying disputed South China Sea islands, Mattis also said no increased US military maneuvers there were needed. Lu, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, on Monday welcomed that stance. \"As for Mattis\\' comment that there is no need for large-scale military operations in the area and the issue should be resolved through diplomacy, these remarks deserve our affirmation,\" Lu said.'],\n",

A suicide bomber detonated his explosives in a parking near the court in the Afghan capital, according to Basir Mojahid, spokesman for Kabul\\'s chief of police. The attack at around 3:45 p.m. local time targeted Supreme Court employees as they were leaving for the day, Mojahid said. At least 35 people were wounded in the blast, according to Saleem Rasooli, head of Kabul hospitals. There have been no initial claims of responsibility. An eyewitness told CNN that he felt the explosion shake the ground as he was leaving his office, opposite the Supreme Court. Nimatullah Mati said the area is home to several residential apartments and was crowded Tuesday afternoon with people who were heading home from work. Ambulances and firetrucks arrived on the scene within five minutes, Mati said. Afghanistan\\'s chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah, expressed his condolences on Twitter. \"The blood of our people isn\\'t cheap & won\\'t be wasted,\" he said. NATO also condemned the attack. \"Anyone who seeks to destabilize the pillars of a functioning government are enemies of Afghanistan,\" Italian army Lt. Gen. Rosario Castellano, deputy commander of the NATO mission in Afghanistan, said in a statement. The blast comes a month after at least 36 people were killed and dozens wounded in two suicide bombings near the Afghan Parliament in Kabul. The Taliban claimed responsibility for those January 10 attacks. Tuesday\\'s blast underscores the growing concern about the security situation in Afghanistan, where the country\\'s security forces and its international allies have been fighting Taliban militants and other radical groups for years. A new report Monday from the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said more than 11,000 people were killed or injured in 2016. That\\'s the highest number of civilian casualties in a single year since the United Nations began systemically documenting those in 2009. The report also shows a record spike in the number of children killed in the long-running Afghanistan War. Of the 3,498 killed last year, 923 were children, the report said. Anti-government forces, mainly the Taliban, were behind almost two-thirds of the casualties, according to the report. ISIS militants have established a presence in the country, and their attacks particularly target Shia Muslims, the report said.'],\n",

The human rights group says as many as 13,000 people have been executed at Saydnaya prison, north of the capital Damascus in a \"hidden\" campaign authorized by senior regime figures. Amnesty\\'s report, Human slaughterhouse, says prisoners are moved in the middle of the night from their cells under the pretext of being transferred. They are taken to the grounds of the prison, where they are hanged, likely unaware of their fate until they feel the noose around their neck, Amnesty alleges. The report is the culmination of a year-long investigation, including interviews with 84 witnesses including security guards, detainees, judges and lawyers, Amnesty says. Most of those hanged were civilians \"believed to be opposed to the government,\" the report finds. \"The horrors depicted in this report reveal a hidden, monstrous campaign, authorized at the highest levels of the Syrian government, aimed at crushing any form of dissent within the Syrian population,\" Lynn Maalouf, the deputy director for research at Amnesty\\'s Beirut office, said in a statement announcing the report. Amnesty International says there are two detention centers at Saydnaya prison. In the \"red building,\" the majority of detainees are civilians who have been arrested since the beginning of the conflict in 2011, according to the organization. In the \"white building,\" the detainees are mainly military officers and soldiers. CNN has asked the Syrian government for comment. The report contends that the executed detainees were given a sham trial by \"a so-called Military Field Court.\" \"The judge will ask the name of the detainee and whether he committed the crime. Whether the answer is yes or no, he will be convicted ... This court has no relation with the rule of law. This is not a court,\" a former judge said, according to Amnesty. Nicolette Waldman, an Amnesty International researcher, elaborated on the horrific conditions prisoners allegedly face. \"They have been actually dying in massive numbers as a result of repeated torture in combination with the systematic deprivation of food, water, medicine and medical care,\" she told CNN. \"(The report) has gotten the attention it deserved,\" Waldman said. \"It\\'s a big story. But for people who work on Syria, it was almost a test case for \\'Does the world still care, not just about death but the fact that it was organized, systematic?\\'\" In light of its findings, she said Amnesty is calling for investigation without delay and for the UN to act immediately. \"I want to be very clear that these practices are unacceptable, and they have to stop. They have to be brought to an end. Mass killings of civilians and extermination so that people are dying of starvation, of illness, of treatable diseases must stop, and Russia has a very special responsibility to uphold peace and security in the world,\" Waldman said. \"We are calling on them to use their influence with the Syrian authorities to push for access to independent monitors to all of the prisons in Syria run by the government where these atrocities are taking place so the perpetrators can be held to account.\" Speaking at the UN, UK Ambassador and Deputy Permanent Representative Peter Wilson responded to the report\\'s allegations. \"We have seen the report of Amnesty International on atrocities in Syria,\" he said. \"Our foreign secretary has said he is sickened by that report. We strongly condemn these atrocities, and we continue to effort to shine a light on what\\'s happening in Syria and to hold people accountable for these actions.\" \\'Just a headline\\' President Assad\\'s regime has previously been accused of extrajudicial killings and war crimes during the country\\'s civil war, which broke out in 2011. In 2014, CNN was given a copy of a report that found \"direct evidence\" of \"systematic torture and killing\" by the Syrian government, based on photographs leaked by a Syrian defector. One of the report\\'s authors called it a \"smoking gun\" proving the use of torture. But Assad has steadfastly maintained that many of the accusations leveled against him are politically motivated. \"I\\'m just a headline -- the bad president, the bad guy, who is killing the good guys,\" Assad told a group of western visitors, including The New York Times, in November. \"You know this narrative. The real reason is toppling the government. This government doesn\\'t fit the criteria of the United States.\" The UN estimates that about 400,000 people have been killed since the start of the war and another 4.8 million have fled the country.'],\n",

It\\'s a chilling prospect and it\\'s just the beginning of the men\\'s downhill course in St. Moritz. The start hut is cut into a rock face and the slick slope is so steep -- 100% or 45 degrees -- TV cameramen must abseil into positions wearing crampons. But the one skier able to conquer their fear and harness this breakneck speed will be crowned world downhill champion for the next two years. The race is the highlight of the 2017 World Championships, which start this week in the chic Swiss town. St. Moritz, the jewel of the Engadin valley, has been a longtime destination for the jetset and draws a well-heeled international clientele to its fine-dining restaurants and five-star hotels.  Often dubbed the \"home of winter sports,\" St. Moritz has hosted two Winter Olympics and four previous World Championships. A total of 600 athletes from more than 70 countries will compete across six alpine skiing disciplines -- slalom, giant slalom, super-G, downhill, super combined (downhill and slalom) and the team event. Outside of the Olympics, it\\'s the biggest event in the sport and carries more cachet than the World Cup circuit. \"It\\'s winning, basically, the Olympics minus all the other sports -- that\\'s what the World Championships is for us. It\\'s big,\" Mikaela Shiffrin, who leads the World Cup overall and slalom standings, told CNN\\'s Alpine Edge. The 21-year-old American is going for a third straight slalom world title after winning gold in Schladming in 2013 and Beaver Creek two years ago. She also won the Olympic slalom gold in 2014, and is aware she has set herself a very high benchmark. \"Not winning stinks -- it makes me feel like I\\'ve done something wrong,\" Shiffrin adds. But the headline attraction will be her compatriot Lindsey Vonn, the second most successful ski racer of all time -- male or female -- with 77 World Cup wins, behind only Sweden\\'s Ingemar Stenmark (86). Speed queen Vonn, the 2010 Olympic downhill champion, won her only world title in 2009 and is back on the circuit following a broken arm and severe nerve damage to her right hand sustained in a crash shortly after returning from knee surgery. Vonn won in only her second race since returning to the circuit in Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Germany in January, but crashed in a downhill at Cortina d\\'Ampezzo in Italy this month. In St. Moritz Tuesday, she skied out during the opening run of the World Championships\\' first race -- the women\\'s super-G -- after trying to regain grip on her pole. \"I just kind of lost my concentration there for a minute,\" Vonn, the 2015 bronze medalist, told reporters. \"I stayed on my feet, so that was the important thing.\" Austria\\'s Nicole Schmidhofer won the gold medal from Tina Weirather of Liechtenstein and home favorite Lara Gut in perfect conditions, after two days of heavy snow had canceled the men\\'s and women\\'s downhill training sessions. Defending champion and Olympic gold medalist Anna Veith didn\\'t make the second run after missing a gate. The women\\'s downhill start is lower than the men\\'s but still a considerable test of skill and stamina. Vonn\\'s main rivals on Sunday will be World Cup overall champion Gut and Slovenia\\'s Ilka Stuhec, this season\\'s World Cup downhill leader. Another Slovenian Tina Maze, who has since retired, won the world title in 2015. The men\\'s downhill takes place Saturday on the legendary \"Free Fall\" course, which was dreamed up by Bernhard Russi, the Swiss two-time downhill world champion and 1972 Olympic gold medalist.

Switzerland\\'s Patrick Kung is the defending champion, but Italy\\'s Peter Fill won the 2015-16 World Cup title and leads the standings this season. Norway\\'s Kjetil Jansrud and Italian Dominik Paris, the winner in Kitzbuhel, are second and third in the World Cup standings. Former wold junior champion Beat Feuz triumphed at St. Moritz last year and the 29-year-old Swiss skier could improve on his World Championship bronze from Beaver Creek in 2015. The men\\'s slalom on February 19 is likely to be a shootout between Austria\\'s Marcel Hirscher and Sweden\\'s Henrik Kristofferson. Hirscher, 27, has won four World Championship golds and a record five overall World Cup titles, while 22-year-old Kristofferson is last year\\'s World Cup slalom champion. It is worth keeping an eye on Briton Dave Ryding, who has been making waves after scoring his country\\'s joint best result in a World Cup race with a second place in the slalom in Kitzbuhel last month.

       " ['Of microbes and machines: How art and science fuse in bio-art Sean Redmond is one of the curators of the Morbis Artis: Diseases of the Arts exhibition. Darrin Sean Verhagen works for RMIT University. He has previously received funding from the Australia Council, Arts Victoria and City of Melbourne. There is art in science -- the artistic precision of the scalpel, the cool aesthetics of the laboratory, and the intimate observations undertaken by scientists to discover new materials and microbes living unseen in the world. Bio-art, an artistic genre that took hold in the 1980s, solidifies, extends and enriches this organic relationship. According to the artist and writer Frances Stracey, it represents: \"a crossover of art and the biological sciences, with living matter, such as genes, cells or animals, as its new media.\" Bio-artists might use and incorporate imaging technologies within the artistic space; bringing living and dead matter into the gallery. They draw upon biology metaphors to imbue artwork with healing and wounding propensities. In BioCouture, for example, fashion, art, and biology are weaved together, blossoming new materials into existence. As author Suzanne Anker has noted, \"Donna Franklin and Gary Cass have invented dresses made from cellulose generated by bacteria from red wine. Suzanne Lee composes \\'growing\\' textiles produced by sugar, tea and bacteria to fashion jackets and kimonos.\" Lee makes jackets out of cellulose produced by bacteria in baths of green tea and sugar. Bio-art includes the skins and cells of celluloid and digital video, the membranes of sound, and the liquids and fluids of body parts and eyeballs. To take another example, in Christian B?k\\'s The Xenotext, a \"chemical alphabet\" is used to translate poetry into sequences of DNA for subsequent implantation into the genome of a bacterium. When translated into a gene and then integrated into the cell, the poetry constitutes a set of instructions, all of which cause the organism to manufacture a viable, benign protein in response. Writes B?k: \"I am, in effect, engineering a life-form so that it becomes not only a durable archive for storing a poem, but also an operant machine for writing a poem \"-one that can persist on the planet until the sun itself explodes...\" Scientists and artists work together in what become teeming new spaces of co-creation. Together, they often set Bio-art within current debates and concerns about what constitutes life, what counts as a sentient being, and who gets to determine what lives are saved, exploited or destroyed. Bio-art draws together the hopes and concerns of scientists and artists as we hurtle into an age where human life and everyday living seems to be undergoing radical and sometimes dangerous transformations. As author Sheel Patel suggests in relation to Bok\\'s work: \"If a living cell can be cultured to spit out and produce novel poetry, could we eventually live in a society where humans are no longer needed to produce new thoughts, and works of literature?\" Arts and disease In the interactive art-science exhibition Morbis Artis: Diseases of the Arts, actual and metaphoric communicative diseases are employed to explore the often toxic relationship between human and non-human life. The exhibition explores the thin doorway that exists between life and death in a vexing age of species and habitat destruction, and the increasingly permeable tissues of contemporary bodies. The discourses of science in particular train us to see and to look for disease in every location. Science\\'s microscopic and bio-technological powers allow it to reach into every atom. Of course, dominant discourse also communes that some spaces, things, and objects are more diseased than others. We are taught to see disease in the homes of outsiders and the nests of insects, in the fabric of pariah nation states and the tissues of certain religions and philosophies. At the same time, new materialism and animal philosophy question the very parameters of what life is, where it can be found, and they turn the question of disease onto humankind, whose activities are seen to infect all that it touches and taints. There is a frightening collision, then, between the possibilities and limitations of human and non-human life: caught as it were between nightmare and dream. Morbis Artis: Diseases of the Arts is composed of 11 artistic works, with each piece using a different media or art form to explore the chaos of the world it draws upon. Each artist imagines disease differently, and yet within the terror of their imaginings there is great beauty, and much hope. In Drew Berry\\'s video projection, infectious cells are \"set free\" so that the very connective tissue of the exhibition room teems with the droplets of life and death. Herpes, influenza, HIV, polio and smallpox bacteria are projected onto the gallery wall as if they have taken flight. Magnified and chaotic, those entering the space are hit by their scale and size. Lienors Torre\\'s multimedia and glass work on degenerative vision explores how our view of the world is metered and tainted by digital technologies. We see two large glass eyeballs, a liquid animation, and a glass cabinet full of jars filled with water in varying degrees of opacity, with engraved eye images on them. Eyes quickly become raindrops as the liquidity of vision is brought to watery life. There are tears and scars that reflect across the eyes of this exquisite art-piece. In Alison Bennett\\'s touch-based screen work, the viewer is presented with a high-resolution scan of bruised skin. Viewers can use the touch-screen to manipulate the soft and damaged tissue before them, and their eyes become organs of touch. What does it feel like to touch a bruise and be bruised? The gallery is thus, both laboratory and studio. In all its variant forms, and with a scalpel and a paintbrush to hand, Bio-art fashions the world anew. Morbis Artis: Diseases of the Arts is currently exhibited at the RMIT Gallery until February 18, 2017.'],\n",
       " ['Joost van der Westhuizen: Fearless rugby legend \\'broke the mold\\' (CNN)Joost van der Westhuizen finally lost his brave battle with a body-wasting disease, but his powerful legacy lives on in modern rugby. Wheelchair-bound and barely able to talk in his later years, the South Africa legend passed away Monday aged 45. Motor neurone disease had left him a shadow of the gladiator who helped the Springboks win the World Cup in 1995, but his contribution to the game will never be forgotten, says former teammate Cobus Visagie. \"Joost basically created the new requirements for a modern No. 9,\" the former South Africa front-row prop told CNN\\'s World Sport show Tuesday. Van der Westhuizen was 6 foot 2 inches tall, but played at scrumhalf -- a position traditionally occupied by the game\\'s smallest players, providing the link between teams\\' backs and forwards. \"Some days I looked down when we were standing in a circle and saw a man with boots three sizes bigger than myself -- a scrumhalf!\" added Visagie, who played alongside van der Westhuizen at the 1999 World Cup and won 29 caps for his country. \"He had incredible speed, he had incredible bravery -- he\\'s very well known for the tackles he made in the crucial 1995 World Cup, but also in all other games.\" In the 1995 World Cup final against New Zealand, van der Westhuizen stopped a rampaging Jonah Lomu when the giant winger had broken through the South African defense. The Springboks went on to win 15-12 in extra time, in the first major sporting event to be staged in South Africa after the end of Apartheid rule. The \\'95 side has achieved iconic status, notably through the Hollywood film \"Invictus.\" \"Who could forget that \\'95 World Cup tackle?\" former Springboks forward Alistair Hargreaves told CNN. \"He was fearless, and for a scrumhalf he certainly broke the mold. As a young boy, he epitomized what South African rugby was all about. We idolized him.\" READ: Blitzboks star leaves sevens on a high READ: Scotland stuns Ireland in Six Nations opener READ: Van der Westhuizen vows to fight motor neurone disease Courage on the field -- and off it Van der Westhuizen was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2011, having retired from international rugby in 2003 with what was then a record 89 caps for the Springboks. Also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig\\'s disease, the condition causes muscles to weaken and waste away over time. In 2014 the \"Ice Bucket Challenge\" became a worldwide phenomenon, with millions of people helping to raise awareness and funds to research the disease. Although he never played alongside van der Westhuizen, Hargreaves -- who left South Africa in 2012 to play domestic rugby in England -- was fortunate enough to met his childhood hero later in life. \"I met him after his career and I probably met him at a time that his illness really kicked in,\" Hargreaves said. \"If he was resilient on the field, he certainly proved to be resilient and even more courageous when he found out about the terrible circumstances he found himself in. \"What a brilliant battle he fought. You can only respect the man for what he did.\" After his diagnosis, van der Westhuizen set up the J9 Foundation, a charity dedicated to helping sufferers of motor neurone disease. \"It is incredibly sad, but Joost fought a long battle,\" Hargreaves added. \"He was aware of the struggle he faced and I presume there is a certain amount of relief at the end of it. \"The guy has achieved so much, he\\'s done so much for rugby, I\\'m sure they\\'re going to hold him up as a real legend of the game.\" Visit cnn.com/rugby for more news and videos A public memorial service will be held on Friday at Loftus Versveld Stadium in Pretoria, South Africa, the home ground of van der Westhuizen\\'s provincial side the Blue Bulls.'],\n",

Nothing is okay anymore (CNN)In the 26th century BC, the Egyptians constructed the Great Pyramid of Giza, an architectural marvel that would remain the tallest structure in the world for millennia, and still stands to this day. In 1499 AD, Michelangelo completed the Pieta, a transcendent marriage of classical ideals and divine imagination long considered one of the finest works ever freed from stone. In 2017, a Flamin\\' Hot Cheeto that looks like a dead gorilla was put up for sale on the internet. Well, we had a good run. We\\'re going to choose NOT to believe the Cheeto -- which \"looks like Harambe the Gorilla\" in the way any given Cheeto looks like anything -- sold for almost $100,000 after a 132-episode bidding war. That\\'s what the eBay page says, but if you believe that, then you are admitting the flame of human innovation dies here, snuffed out under an amorphous log of cornmeal and monosodium glutamate. The seller of this foul totem does, however, appear to be legit. The account has been active since 2008 and has enough buyer and seller feedback for there to be a dim possibility that someone doled out a luxury cars\\' worth of cash on a Cheeto. CNN has reached out for comment. Really, we did. To salt the wound, there are now dozens of Harambe Cheeto-related items polluting the eBay listings, a cruel burlesque at the nadir of consumerism and irony and possibly humanity itself. If you want one, you can buy one with your hard-earned money. Or, you could open up any bag of Cheetos and squint. It doesn\\'t matter. Nothing matters anymore.'],\n",
       " ['Lion-killer Maasai turn wildlife warriors to save old enemy (CNN)The Maasai have roamed Tanzania since time immemorial. Cattle in tow, the East African pastoralists have circled the land looking for fresh grass, co-existing with nature for as long as anyone can remember. But nature is not always kind. Fifty percent of the world\\'s lion population lives in East Africa -- and lions like to eat livestock. Historically the Maasai would use deadly force to protect their herds, often heading out in revenge parties to hunt and kill lions. There were ritual killings also, known as \"Ala-mayo.\" Killing a lion, a symbol of strength and power, was a rite of passage for Maasai initiates into \"Morani,\" the warrior class. Armed with a spear, these youths became men in the process, returning to the tribe to be treated with new-found respect. The Tanzanian government banned ritual killing in the 1970s, but certain pockets of activity were silently condoned. In Ngorongoro Crater, north west of Tarangire National Park and a conservation area since 1959, the practice was judged sustainable due to the high lion concentration and low human presence. In the 1960s the tribe claimed no more than 10 animals per year, but as with so much of the world in the 20th century, the Maasai\\'s population grew in Ngorongoro. Forty lions, if not more, are now under threat annually in the conservation area, and all over Tanzania lion numbers are declining. Conservationists know the problem needs to be addressed, and in a remarkable turnaround they\\'ve enlisted the very best gamekeepers to patrol the Maasai Steppe: the Maasai themselves. At around 5am the Maasai \"Wildlife Warriors\" rise to birdsong, nature\\'s alarm clock. A bowl of porridge and cup of chai to start the day. Slipping on a pair of sandals, their soles recycled from old car tires, the Warriors head out of their \"kraal,\" a small sheltered community, to begin tracking. These Maasai have traded in their hunting ways for a life of conservation. Part of an initiative run by the Tanzania People and Wildlife Fund, an organization specializing in human-animal conflict, the Warriors are spread across communities in Tarangire and the surrounding rangeland, using their skills, their lifeblood, to protect what was once their adversary. Beyond the \"boma,\" a low wall surrounding the \"kraal,\" tracks line the dirt. They betray the lions, hyenas and wild dogs who visit in the night, drawn to livestock and, in the dry season, the community\\'s water supply. On an uneventful day, Warriors might take a car owned by the Fund and conduct an animal headcount, circling the Steppe in the early morning. But sometimes tracks start inside the \"boma,\" suggesting a big cat. When big cat footprints are involved, they usually lead to a kill. The next step is crucial. \"People are becoming more and more angry towards wildlife,\" says Wildlife Warrior Lucas Lengoje. In the past a carcass resulted in retribution. The head of cattle per person has decreased among the Maasai in recent years, meaning the pain of every loss is felt all the more. \"The community finds it very difficult to comprehend the importance of the wildlife,\" Lengoje adds. \"It takes time to calm them down and for them to believe you, as they care more about their livestock than wildlife.\" Some of the reprisals have become extreme. Aside from spearings, Maasai have begun poisoning carcasses between a lion\\'s initial gorge and second feed. This not only kills the lion, but anything that feeds on the lion\\'s subsequent carcass. Wildlife Warriors intercede, dissipate the situation, and ultimately provide solutions for their communities and those around them. One of their primary concerns is to document the attack and location, using GPS to map the incident on the Fund\\'s database. They\\'ll also warn neighboring herders of the dangers nearby, and sometimes provide contact details so Maasai can claim compensation from the government. Then begins the long-term approach to preventing cattle loss. \"Living Walls\" (African myrrh trees joined by chain link fences) are being used by the Fund and built in collaboration with the Maasai, and have been rolled out across communities. \"The difference between the \\'boma\\' and the Living Wall is that the living wall uses chain link,\" explains Elvis Kisimir, from the Fund. \\'Bomas\\' contain dried twigs from the thorny acacia bush, but chain link is infinitely more effective, especially when fortified with living, fast-growing thorny trees, which only become more impassable with age. In the wet season these walls reach over 12 feet high. \"We currently have more than 700 \\'bomas,\\' and the Living Wall is a program that has safeguarded 99% of our livestock at night,\" says Kisimir. This immediate success is being supplemented with education programs fronted by Maasai Wildlife Warriors, aimed at neutralizing any antagonism between man and his fellow predators. \"If we decided to do this on our own, we wouldn\\'t achieve much,\" admits Kisimir. \"Community is everything.\" Laly Lichtenfeld, executive director of the Fund, describes this as \"the next step,\" and a way to help create a self-regulating environment in which both Maasai and lions can prosper. \"The Maasai people are absolutely critically integral to the conservation process in northern Tanzania,\" she adds. \"This is their land, and their livelihoods are so dependent on wise environmental stewardship. \"Healthy grasslands mean healthy livestock. And the livestock, the cattle, are core of their being -- who they are. It\\'s their pride, it\\'s their identity; it\\'s their economic wellbeing. And so if they can manage to really keep these ecosystems intact and healthy, then everything in the system benefits.\"'],\n",
       " ['Playful humor: The Dalai Lama\\'s secret weapon (and how it can be yours, too) (CNN)When you are the spiritual leader of an entire people, you\\'ve lived your entire adult life in exile, your movements are restricted by ever-watchful bodyguards and you must watch every word for fear of setting off an international incident, you would think your face would reflect the weight of the world. But when you are the Dalai Lama, the deepest lines on your 81-year-old skin are laugh lines. His Holiness knows how to find joy in nearly everything and everyone, largely because of his sense of humor. It is something he uses regularly to quickly win over crowds and something he thinks everyone should embrace in order to have a better life. When he presided over the Emory-Tibet Symposium in December at an imposing temple owned by the Tibetan community in exile in Mundgod, India, he showed his teasing nature right away. Gathered were thousands of saffron-robed nuns and monks, world-renowned scientists, Tibetans and many interested followers, eager learn how to \"bridge science and Buddhism for mutual enrichment.\" The crowd looked as serious as the topic. As they waited in the temple, they murmured quietly and shifted in their seats. Finally, the low moan of a guttural chant began, and everyone quieted and sat up a little straighter. When His Holiness finally emerged from a side door, the sound of scraping plastic chairs echoed throughout the hall as the crowd stood and applauded. Some prostrated themselves on the ground. His Holiness walked in slowly, surrounded by monks in traditional robes and bodyguards in Western dress. Two monks gently guided him down a small set of steps. At the bottom, the Dalai Lama smiled with great joy, laughing and waving at the friends gathered in his honor. \"When you smile, I notice everyone around you smiles. I notice it is very contagious as well,\" said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN\\'s Chief Medical correspondent, in an interview with His Holiness after the event. \"Basically, we are social animal,\" the Dalai Lama replied. \"We need friend. In order to develop genuine friendship, trust is very important. For trust, if you show them genuine sort of respect, genuine love, then trust come, so here I think the expression of genuine warm feeling smile I think part of that, that\\'s genuine smile.\" But it is clear that joking around is also key to winning over a crowd. At the event, the Dalai Lama finally sat in his floral chair, against what looked like a pillow one of the monks must have grabbed from his bed, hoping to make him more comfortable. The crowd quieted, leaning forward to hear what His Holiness had to say. But instead of a prayer or a gentle word of wisdom, he decided it was the perfect time to wipe his brow. He took his time and then, rather than putting the white washcloth on the table next to him, he immediately put it on his head, where it rested like an absurd floppy hat. Giggling, he wore it through first part of the meeting, for about an hour. Then, he reached with some ceremony for a glass jar of candy on the low table in front of him. \"This is not decoration,\" he joked, holding it up. He pointed to himself -- \"eat\" -- and promptly unwrapped the gold foil to pop a hard candy into his mouth. His impish behavior, laughing and joking did the trick. The solemn and respectful crowd began laughing with him, warming up immediately. Everyone seemed ready to listen to a discussion of heavy topics such as \"What are the fundamental constituents of the universe, and how did it originate?\" and \"How is knowledge established and what constitutes valid reasoning?\" When Gupta later asked His Holiness about why he decided to wear the washcloth so comically, the Dalai Lama admitted it was, in part, because he is practical and gets hot. But he also hinted that there was something deeper: It\\'s important for leaders, particularly spiritual leaders, to \"act like a human being\" and to be playful. Often, \"everyone too much formal,\" he said, \"That is self-torture.\" And though he knows he must respect those leaders, despite \"no word, no movement\" from them, he has sometimes developed \"a strange thinking\" and often hopes something unexpected will happen to make that leader act more \"like a human being.\" \"I had this experience (in) 1954 when I was in Peking,\" His Holiness said. \"Some Indian ambassador, he call on me, come to my room, then as usual, some Chinese foreign ministries officials come. \"Everyone too much formal like that,\" he said then mimed being stiff. \"Then somehow they brought some fruit, somehow dumped over, and then everyone acted like a human being,\" he said, laughing and miming people scrambling around, as he saw them do around on the floor. His Holiness suggests everyone let themselves be playful and find the funny in life. In his book \"My Spiritual Journey,\" he calls himself a \"professional laugher\" and writes that he comes from a cheerful family that is always \"amusing ourselves, teasing each other, joking. It\\'s our habit.\" A quick laugh and an ability to see humor in daily situations and to be playful have been shown to help adults lower stress levels, both for themselves and for those around them, studies show. By being playful and using humor, people also become more observant and more empathetic. They are often bored less, they learn more, they have more friends, and studies show that people who are willing to let out their playful side tend to have a better sense of all-around well-being.  His Holiness believes that no matter how difficult your life may be, this approach will bring you something much deeper. \"Thinking only of the negative aspect doesn\\'t help to find solutions and it destroys peace of mind,\" he writes. \"I love smiles, and my wish is to see more smiles, real smiles. ... If we want those smiles, we must create the reasons that make them appear.\"'],\n",

       " ['Trump\\'s terrorism claim is baloney Peter Bergen is CNN\\'s national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the author of \"United States of Jihad: Investigating America\\'s Homegrown Terrorists.\" Now comes President Donald Trump\\'s claim Monday at the key US military base overseeing the war on ISIS -- US Central Command in Tampa, Florida -- that the media aren\\'t reporting terrorism for \"reasons\" the President didn\\'t elaborate upon. Trump told the CENTCOM audience, \"You\\'ve seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe, it\\'s happening. It\\'s gotten to a point where it\\'s not even being reported. And in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn\\'t want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that.\" To \"prove\" that the media aren\\'t covering terrorism adequately the Trump White House, which is fighting in court to reinstate a refugee ban citing the terrorist threat, on Monday night released a list of 78 \"major\" terrorist attacks since September 2014, claiming, \"Most have not received the media attention they deserved.\" This is one of the biggest baloney sandwiches this White House has foisted on the public since ... well ... the \"Bowling Green massacre,\" but it\\'s a much bigger and harder-to swallow helping of baloney because it is the President who is forcing it down our throats rather than one of his aides. Taking the White House timeline of terrorist attacks, I ran it through the Nexis database, which is an authoritative resource for tracking media hits of all types, including in newspapers, magazines, wire service reports, TV news shows and the like. The results show that terrorist attacks over the past couple of years are, in fact, some of the most well-reported stories of our times. The total number of media hits for the 78 terrorist attacks that the White House released Monday is 80,878, or about an average of slightly more than 1,000 mentions per incident. And those numbers clearly understate how much coverage the media have given these incidents because a Nexis search only will display a maximum of 3,000 mentions for any given search. There are 16 terrorist attacks on the White House list of purportedly under-covered attacks that each elicited more than 3,000 media mentions. The following are a representative sample: \"?In Ottawa in October 2014 Michael Zehaf-Bibeau killed a Canadian soldier. \"?Two months later in Sydney, Man Haron Monis killed two Australians. \"?In March 2015, 21 tourists were killed at the Bardo Museum in Tunis, Tunisia. \"?Two months later in Garland, Texas, two ISIS-inspired militants attacked a Prophet Mohammed cartoon contest. Luckily no one was killed except the terrorists. \"?In Tunisia, also in 2015, 38 were killed at a beach popular with Westerners. \"?In October 2015, 224 were killed in Sinai, Egypt, when ISIS brought down a Russian passenger jet with a bomb. The terror attacks in Paris and Nice, France, that Trump cited in his CENTCOM speech also received more than 3,000 media mentions. The terrorist attacks that didn\\'t get as much coverage were -- surprise --- the ones where there were no deaths or that took place in countries such as Saudi Arabia or Bangladesh where there is little independent media reporting. In three cases, there were no articles listed in the publications included in the Nexis database, and in each of those cases there were no casualties. The media, including CNN, have exhaustively covered terrorism around the globe since the 9/11 attacks made the issue a central national security concern. Indeed, the wall-to-wall media coverage of the ISIS attacks in Paris in November 2015 in which 129 were killed and the ISIS-inspired attack in San Bernardino, California, a month later in which 14 were killed was instrumental in boosting Trump in the polls, according to the polling analysis site FiveThirtyEight Many Americans felt threatened by the ISIS-directed and ISIS-inspired attacks. As the presidential campaign was in full swing at the beginning of 2016, just over half of Americans said they were very or somewhat worried that they, or a member of their family, would be victims of a terrorist attack. This was the largest number to feel that way since just after the 9/11 attacks. And how did so many Americans learn about the terrorist attacks they were so scared of? Here\\'s a clue: It wasn\\'t through telepathy. Below is the official White House timeline of terrorist attacks since September 2014 with my annotations in bold about the media coverage they each received. (There are a number of incorrectly spelled words I have left as they were in the original.)

       " ['Trump vs. America: The fight for democracy Frida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review, and a former CNN producer and correspondent. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Trump was defending the Russian President after Fox\\'s Bill O\\'Reilly called Putin a \"killer.\" His response, \"You think our country is so innocent,\" reveals Trump\\'s dismissive attitude toward the most fundamental democratic norms that America has aspired to embody. Clearly, the United States has made many grave mistakes throughout history, but the country\\'s guiding principles have remained unchanged: the fierce defense of individual liberties and an unshakeable commitment to democratic ideals. In Russia, by contrast, Putin has decimated the opposition, imprisoned critics and taken control of all branches of government. The free press is a faint shadow of its former self, and Putin\\'s critics, including journalists, continue to turn up dead under suspicious circumstances. One of Putin\\'s most vocal critics, Vladimir Kara-Murza, remains in a Moscow hospital in \"grave condition\" after suffering a \"full organ failure\" that, as his lawyer told CNN, doctors agree is the result of a \"toxic substance.\" Despite Trump\\'s comments and recent executive actions, Trump should expect push-back from a country committed to liberal democratic principles. This division between the President and the American people makes the United States the latest battleground in a worldwide clash of ideologies. When the wave of populist authoritarianism started, few would have expected the United States, the principal beacon of modern democracy for over 200 years, to fall under the spell of nativist politics. But fall it did. The many Americans who remain skeptical of Trump and now find themselves protesting on a weekly basis can take comfort in knowing they are not alone. On Sunday, while the American public was rapt in the Super Bowl, an astonishing sight came into focus in Romania. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets to protest a government push to decriminalize corruption. The remarkable part was that protesters had already won. Demonstrations had begun six days earlier, after the government tried to quietly pass a decree that would have cleared the records and freed from prison people convicted of corruption for amounts less than $47,000. The government agreed to rescind the order. But the demonstrations only grew, with protesters saying they came out to protect their democracy. Romanians knew they had to fight for democracy because of their recent communist past and the onslaught in neighboring countries against liberal democracy, which requires separation of powers, a free judiciary, free and fair elections and, yes, freedom to protest. Sadly, now, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and the surge of refugee arrivals, demagogic politicians have leveraged popular discontent, lashing out against foreigners, vowing to put their country\\'s \"true\" residents first, and gradually dismantling the foundations of liberal democracy. Romanians seem to have won round one. But the forces defending democracy elsewhere, including in neighboring Hungary, have been losing. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban openly declared he\\'s building an \"illiberal state,\" and is making strides in his quest to imitate regimes run by the likes of Putin. Democratic freedoms have suffered sharp reverses in recent years. Turkey is slipping into dictatorship, Venezuela remains mired in autocracy, as do countries in every continent. But what\\'s ahead for the United States? Some veterans of the battle are pessimistic. When millions of mostly women took to the streets the day after Trump\\'s inauguration, Julia Ioffe, whose family fled Russia, threw cold water on their jubilant movement, tweeting, \"The happy, feisty crowds, the clever signs - it all feels like the protests in Moscow in 2011. That went nowhere.\" It\\'s true that protests have not achieved much against other authoritarian regimes. In Venezuela, the Chavista regime came to power in 1999, and despite every effort from a determined opposition, it remains in power. In Turkey, mass demonstrations, and even what seemed like electoral victories, have failed to stop Recep Tayyip Erdogan\\'s march to de facto dictator. In Russia, Putin is all but unchallenged, with a quiescent legislature and near-complete control of the news Russians consume. But the story is likely to have a different outcome in the United States. Yascha Mounk, a Harvard expert in right-wing populism, observed that Trump is turning out to be \"more authoritarian than I feared,\" though the opposition is also proving \"more courageous than I expected.\" America has deeper democratic roots than any of the countries whose liberal democracies has been toppled. The national religion is freedom from tyranny. The day after Trump took office, Americans put on what may have been the largest national demonstration in the country\\'s history. A week later, when Trump issued his travel ban for seven Muslim-majority countries, spontaneous demonstrations materialized at major airports across the country. Lawyers filed legal briefs on the spot. While the Republican-controlled Congress has proven mostly silent in countering Trump\\'s attacks on the independent media and the judiciary, the press appears determined to do its job and judges seem unintimidated by White House bullying. Even members of the executive branch are speaking out. Many Americans support Trump, but there are signs that his sharp break with democratic traditions, his attacks on judges, his fulminations against the media and against critics of all stripes -- from comedians to restaurant reviewers -- are producing a backlash. History is being written by two opposing forces -- those fighting for and those fighting against liberal democracy. President Trump\\'s likening of America to Putin\\'s Russia puts him on the illiberal side. But the American people have spent hundreds of years building a strong democratic system, and they are prepared to fight to defend it.'],\n",
       " ['Trump has become Putin\\'s ally in Russia\\'s war on the West Edward Lucas is a senior editor at The Economist, where he was the Moscow bureau chief from 1998 to 2002. He is also senior vice president at the Center for European Policy Analysis, a Washington, DC, think tank. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. \"Whataboutism\" was a favorite Kremlin propaganda technique during the Cold War. It aimed to portray the West as so morally flawed that its criticism of the Soviet empire was hypocritical. Any criticism of the Soviet Union (the war in Afghanistan, martial law in Poland, persecution of dissidents) was met with a list of Western abuses (supporting fascist dictatorships, trampling trade unions, racial oppression). It was well encapsulated in a joke about the fictional Radio Yerevan (a staple of Soviet-era humor) in which a caller asks what is the average wage of an American manual worker. The real answer would undermine Soviet claims to economic superiority, so after a pause, the pundit replies: \"Over there they lynch Negroes.\" By the time the system collapsed, that phrase had become a derisive synecdoche for Soviet propaganda as a whole. \"Whataboutism\" seemed to have died in the 1990s when Russia\\'s official aim was to become like the West. But it made a comeback under President Vladimir Putin, whose propaganda machine specializes in spreading FUD (Fear Uncertainty and Doubt) in the West. If Americans, Britons, Germans and others can be made to believe that their rulers are crooks and idiots, and that legality and liberty are a sham, then they will be much less likely to take risks and make sacrifices in defending their own countries. To some extent, \"whataboutism\" is a sensible tactic in argument. Criticism delivered from a purported moral high ground deserves special scrutiny. We shouldn\\'t take lessons from Russia about minority rights, say, given the way that the Kremlin mistreats its own indigenous populations -- Maris, Buryats, Komis and the like. But unlike Putin\\'s Russia, the West is genuinely well placed to make such criticisms. We are not perfect. But we are self-critical and self-correcting. The cornerstone of our system is contestability. Of course, our elected representatives and government officials make mistakes -- but they are constrained and challenged for them. They risk civil and criminal legal actions, impeachment, media scrutiny, public protest and being tossed out of office into a lifetime of disgrace. These checks and balances are imperfect too, but they do work. President FranÃ§ois Hollande has misruled France only mildly by Russian standards. But whereas he won\\'t get a second term, President Putin can stay in office as long as he wants. President Trump has made an outrageous mistake in his visa ban and has immediately run into legal obstacles. When was the last time a Russian court told Putin that his actions were illegal? All this is lost on Trump. He appears to wish that America were more like Russia. He finds legal constraints on executive power outrageous. That view is not just mistaken: it is dangerous. All over the world, people look to America as a beacon of freedom and justice. It sets a standard (albeit sometimes a theoretical one) by which other political systems are judged. That represents a huge store of political capital. Trump is squandering it with every word he utters. Moral relativism corrodes sentiment in the frontline states of the new cold war. In places like Bulgaria, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, pro-Western figures are feeling that their struggle is doomed. Why bother fighting for freedom when the leader of the free world has given up? Worse than this, the thinking will spread that maybe Putin is right: the world is all about power and money, and the political currency that really works is coined from lies and fear. If those are the real rules of the game, then better to play them. It seems to have worked for Trump, after all.

       " ['Sean Spicer has a problem: Melissa McCarthy S.E. Cupp is the author of \"Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media\\'s Attack on Christianity,\" co-author of \"Why You\\'re Wrong About the Right\" and a columnist at the New York Daily News. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. Let\\'s hope these came in handy when he watched Melissa McCarthy parody the White House spokesman on \"Saturday Night Live\" over the weekend.  We all know his thin-skinned, humorless boss, President Donald Trump, has not taken kindly to SNL\\'s countless spoofs, complaining on Twitter that SNL is \"unwatchable,\" \"totally biased\" and \"not funny.\" He\\'s also said that Alec Baldwin\\'s impersonation \"just can\\'t get any worse.\" I happen to largely agree with that assessment. \"SNL\" has taken to merely mimicking Trump and his antics through Baldwin, rather than cleverly satirizing him. Despite plenty of material to work with, thus far, the Trump-SNL era has been, well, boring and predictable.  Until this weekend, that is. The difference between the usual Trump spoofs and McCarthy\\'s take on Spicer is that hers was actually hilarious.  A podium-wielding McCarthy plays on Spicer\\'s rocky start at the White House -- his oratorical stumbles, his new, Trump-like scorn for critical press, his equally Trumpian fact-manipulation -- with a well-studied ear for his tics and tone.  Exaggerating a White House spokesman might sound like inside-the-beltway kind of humor that average viewers won\\'t appreciate or find funny. But in the theatrical, reality-television era of Trump, everyone around him is a character, too. And in this case, \"SNL\" writers didn\\'t just mimic Spicer, they encapsulated a far bigger story: this is what it looks like when a normal, professional political operative becomes Trumpified. And if you didn\\'t laugh out loud, you may have Trump\\'s thin-skin disorder. But will Spicer follow his boss\\'s lead, tweeting out how unfunny \"SNL\" is, or telling reporters that the show is biased and unwatchable? Not if he\\'s smart, he won\\'t.  If an \"SNL\" spoof is funny, there\\'s only one way for the spoofee to handle it -- embrace it. At his next press briefing (Monday\\'s was called off), where he will undoubtedly be asked about it, he should laugh it off, say he was flattered, and then make a joke at his own expense. He already took a crack at this approach in an interview with Extra on Sunday, telling AJ Calloway that McCarthy \"could dial back\" a bit, but also managing to call the show \"funny.\"  If he can keep this up, he\\'d be following a long tradition of politicos taking parody in stride.  In 1995, House Republicans invited Chris Farley, who\\'d been impersonating Speaker Newt Gingrich on \"SNL,\" to impersonate him to his face at the conference meeting while Gingrich laughed along.  After spoofing George H.W. Bush for four years, Dana Carvey was invited to the White House to meet him. After Bush lost to Bill Clinton, he had Carvey come cheer up his staff.  In October of 2008, after Tina Fey spent weeks perfectly portraying then Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, Palin appeared on \"SNL\" alongside Fey and Alec Baldwin, who \"mistakes\" her for Fey -- his former 30 Rock co-star -- and asks how she could appear on the show with the real Palin, \"that horrible woman.\"  But that was all BT -- Before Trump. I know dozens of people in his new administration and many have become more like him, at least outwardly. They\\'ve become defensive, self-serious and aggressive, and they\\'ve adopted Trump\\'s rhetorical penchant for hyperbole, bombast and fact-blurring. They say things publicly that I know they never would have said before. It seems like they\\'re playing a part in a new Trump reality show. I wouldn\\'t be surprised if Spicer reverts to Trump\\'s lack of humor toward unflattering satire, just to stick to script. But that would make it infinitely worse. It\\'s already problematic that the credibility of the White House and its staff is being lampooned only two weeks into the job. With the elevation of Trump political adviser Steve Bannon, some are wondering who are the cooler heads and saner voices surrounding the president. If the White House wants to allay these fears -- and perhaps they do not -- Spicer should be his cooler, saner, pre-Trump self, and play along with McCarthy\\'s performance. Otherwise, the notion that Trump\\'s White House can\\'t take a joke gets a lot more serious.'],\n",
       " [\"#MyFreedomDay: Students stand up to slavery on March 14 (CNN)Right now, between 21 and 45 million people are trapped in slavery. At least 5.5 million of those are children. Although slavery is outlawed in every country, criminals earn more than $150 Billion every year from enslaving people.  But you can do something about it. On MARCH 14, 2017, we want YOU and your school to join us for #MyFreedomDay. We're asking students to organize events at their school on the day to highlight modern slavery and celebrate freedom. The schools that show the most spirit in fighting slavery will be featured on CNN TV, CNN.com and CNN Facebook. A few schools will even receive a visit from a CNN correspondent, who will report live from the school on the day. So how do you take part? We're encouraging students and teachers to come up with their own ideas, but here are some suggestions for the kind of thing you could do.  Film Screening - Look for movies or documentaries that deal with human trafficking. If you want to use a CNN documentary, we'll let you show it for free. You can watch the videos at cnn.com/myfreedom.  Art Show -- Create art work, in any media, and show it off at the school then post it to Twitter or Instagram using #MyFreedomDay. The theme can be anti-slavery and should include peaceful, hopeful messages; art work about survivors and traffickers, and any form of expression that highlights human trafficking in a way that will raise awareness to your community.  Stand for Freedom -- Students can stand for 45 mins (or 45 hours, if you're really dedicated!) to represent the 45 million victims of slavery in the world today.  Holi Day - The Indian Festival in March celebrates love and color to raise awareness and money. Festivities involve washable pigmented powders that can be thrown at each other. Add music and a booth for human trafficking information and you have a full day of fun for the community.  Panel Discussion -- Invite local lawmakers and anti-trafficking organizations to discuss the issue and what it looks like not just abroad, but in your hometown.  Day of Service -- Support a half-day of service where students volunteer at rehabilitation centers, visit their local lawmakers for a call to action, or collect items needed for survivors in conjunction with local organizations.  It doesn't matter what you do, as long as you do something. Let us know your plans by telling us on Twitter or Instagram, using #MyFreedomDay. (You must be aged 13 or older to post on social media).  Find out more at cnn.com/myfreedom. And you can use the same hashtag to tell us what freedom means to you. - It could be the freedom to see your friends or family - Freedom to be yourself - Freedom to do the job you choose - Freedom to travel - Freedom to express yourself the way you choose  Whatever freedom means in your life -- the important thing is the message, and encouraging people to think about the freedom they may take for granted.\"],\n",
       " ['The other migrant crisis: Thousands risk journey through Latin America Paso Canoas, Costa Rica (CNN)Yolanda ticks off the countries she and her husband have passed through in the last three months: Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama and now Costa Rica. But she is no tourist. \"A lot of roads, lots of bus rides, and a lot of walking too,\" she tells CNN, agreeing to be interviewed but asking that we only use her first name and not show her face. \"For a 7-month pregnant woman, that is a long, long time.\" Yolanda says she is originally from Congo. She and her husband are among tens of thousands of migrants -- many from Africa and Haiti -- criss-crossing South and Central America trying to reach the United States. Now they\\'re stuck in the border town of Paso Canoas, Costa Rica, waiting for the travel documents that will let them enter the country and continue their journey northward.  \"I hope to leave soon, for my turn to come fast so I can see a doctor,\" she says. \"I don\\'t want my baby to be born on the road.\" Read: Deadly crossing into Europe Long an obligatory stop on an important trade and tourist route, Paso Canoas has seen an unprecedented influx of migrants trekking north in recent months.  The huge surge in undocumented arrivals is a logistical and humanitarian nightmare for the government of Costa Rica.  \"At this moment Costa Rica is absolutely overwhelmed with our immigration situation and we\\'re doing our best to protect the human rights of the people who are coming,\" said Mauricio Herrera Ulloa, the Costa Rican Communications Minister and point person for the migration crisis.  \"No one was prepared or was thinking about the possibility that we would receive 10,000 people from Haiti or Africa.\" Perilous journeys Since April, when Costa Rica first started issuing transit visas for undocumented migrants, more than 18,000 people have crossed the border into the country. There are no comparative figures because the demand simply wasn\\'t there in previous years so the visas didn\\'t exist, officials say.  It is a situation that is being replicated in border towns throughout the Americas.  Experts say migrants are risking their lives in perilous journeys that expose them to crime and hunger and leave them vulnerable to human trafficking. \"They offer (migrants) something that they really need and in the case of these people, what they really need is to get one more border north,\" says Cy Winter, director of border management for the International Organization for Migration (IOM). More on human trafficking That means they often pay so-called coyotes for illegal border crossings -- breaking their ties to the state and public administration system. They often fall prey to false job offers \"just over the border.\"  \"But then, on the other side, what\\'s arranged there is completely different,\" says Winter. \"So they end up in a place where they have to work and they\\'ve got no way to get away from it.\" \\'Congo isn\\'t a country, it\\'s a password\\'  The IOM and other experts believe the majority of migrants are Haitians, many of them pretending to be Congolese in order to avoid deportation since it would be too costly for most Latin American countries to fly them to Africa. And in both Haiti and Congo, French is spoken.  \"The people I\\'ve spoken to claiming to be from Congo, barely know the capital and don\\'t know the dialects that are spoken in the Congo and don\\'t know the football jersey,\" said Winter.  According to the US Secretary of Homeland Security, some 40,000 Haitian migrants are working their way north, already overwhelming many border crossings into the United States.  Many of them entered Brazil as legal refugees after the 2010 earthquake. But the economic crisis in Brazil has made it increasingly difficult for migrants to get jobs, sparking an exodus. \"We\\'ve seen accumulations of up to 5,000 people on the border in various countries in South America so it is a concerning uptick in arrivals,\" said Winter.  One migrant I met on the Panamanian-Costa Rican border told me that every single one of the dozens of \"Congolese\" migrants milling about the migration office was actually from Haiti.  \"Here, Congo isn\\'t a country, it\\'s a password,\" he said, explaining that he and others destroy their passports so that they can re-invent themselves.  The bottlenecks at borders have raised serious concerns. The IOM has begun offering workshops at schools like Colegio Progreso -- in Panama, just across the border from Paso Canoas -- teaching students about the connection between migration and human trafficking.  In the past, the school was used as a shelter for hundreds of Cubans trying to make their way to the United States. The regional school director says she heard stories of women turning to prostitution in desperation.  \"In relation to the people being trafficked, we\\'ve heard horror stories,\" said Flor Bonilla.  In San Jose, the capital of Costa Rica, Marilia Morales is just as worried. She founded the non-profit Rahab Foundation 20 years ago to rescue, rehabilitate and support survivors of sexual exploitation. Now she\\'s launching a project on Costa Rica\\'s northern border with Nicaragua.  \"We have an avalanche of people coming, we have Africans, Haitians, we have people coming from a lot of places,\" Morales told CNN.  \"We are in the process of training our personnel and we are going to be working with this community directly because they have to be aware that they could be victims of human trafficking, either for slave labor, sexual slavery and other ends,\" she said.  Nicaragua has closed its borders to undocumented migrants forcing thousands on the border into deplorable makeshift shelters and tent villages.  On Costa Rica\\'s southern border, officials are trying to process migrants as quickly as possible. They\\'re admitting 100-200 a day, but there is a long waiting list. In Yolanda\\'s case, her hopes for a quick trip through Costa Rica were quickly dashed. Upon arrival, she was told she would have to wait six weeks just for an appointment with immigration officials.  Without the laissez-passer, she and her husband can\\'t access the shelters set up by authorities in conjunction with the Red Cross -- warehouses and schools where migrants get free meals and a mattress to sleep on.  For the time being, they are sleeping in a makeshift hostel just a short walk from the border. They pay $5 a day and squeeze in with some 50 other people.  Yolanda says she left Congo for Brazil, where she worked in a restaurant for a year. She says both she and her husband lost their jobs in the recession -- just as they discovered she was pregnant. Now, their dream is for their daughter to be born in the United States.  But the odds are not in their favor. The money they borrowed from family back home is running out and she says they can\\'t ask for more.  While Yolanda says she is from Congo, when I first met her, she couldn\\'t at first remember or pronounce what she said was her hometown: Brazzaville, the capital of Congo.  When the time came to say goodbye to Yolanda and her husband, I couldn\\'t help but wonder where they came from, and where this journey will ultimately take them.  Unfortunately for Haitians trying to make their way into the United States, officials recently eliminated the generous benefits and easy entry that were established after the 2010 earthquake.  Which means that even if they make it to the US border after months of travel and hardship, neither Haitian nor Congolese migrants are likely to get in. '],\n",

But Chopek is finally speaking out, determined to shake the guilt and shame that she knows should stalk her perpetrators instead of her. \"Now I see that I was just a child,\" says Chopek, now sitting serenely in a safe house, a healing lodge in rural Manitoba that cradled her in the love and protection she so needed when she escaped her life on the streets. Now 19, Lauren was just 14 when she was sexually exploited and trafficked for sex in her hometown of Winnipeg. But as an indigenous girl in Canada, her story is hardly rare. More from the CNN Freedom Project Canada\\'s indigenous population is very small -- just 4% of the population -- yet more than 50% of all sex trafficking victims in Canada are indigenous. The reasons are complicated and varied but are ultimately rooted in a legacy of poverty, racism and abuse. \"I was actually making these bad choices for a reason,\" explains Chopek. \"You know when you experience sexual abuse it\\'s really confusing. You never know if it\\'s your fault or is it theirs.\" \\'Targets of violence and abuse\\' Diane Redsky runs Ma Mawi Wi Chi Itata Centre, which advocates for indigenous women and children, specifically sex trafficking victims. Her organization runs the rural healing lodge where Chopek stayed, as well as safe houses, rehabilitation and prevention programs throughout Manitoba. Read: Trafficked women tattooed by their pimps Redsky says the history of racism against indigenous Canadians feeds into the cycle of violence and exploitation against them. \"It\\'s really difficult to be able to fight those stereotypes as indigenous women when a whole society is targeting indigenous women and girls, particularly for violence and abuse -- and that spills over into sex trafficking,\" says Redsky. Tanay Little\\'s story shows how insidious the abuse can be. Little was just 11 when she was sexually exploited on the streets surrounding her family\\'s home in Winnipeg. An older girl, someone who pretended to be her friend she says, was actually preying on Little, first luring her with drugs and then trafficking her for sex. \"I remember one time that she put me in a room and then two guys, one, not together, but one would come in and then I would have sex with him and then the other the other guy would come in. And then I\\'d get high after that,\" says Little. She is blunt about what would happen if she refused to have sex with anybody. \"If you\\'re not beat up, then you would get raped by a few of them at once,\" explains Little. \"There is a debt bondage that\\'s between $1,000 and $2,000 a day that these girls must bring, must hand in to their trafficker or else,\" says Redsky. These startling anecdotes have been heard in family homes, police stations and safe houses for years in Manitoba. The province is now taking the lead on an innovative approach to prevention and rehabilitation. Focus on the victims Redsky and others in Manitoba are now leading transformative programs to help identify the threats and risks so prevalent in indigenous communities. It is a new approach to help fight sex trafficking, one that focuses on the needs of the victims. Jennifer Richardson runs Tracia\\'s Trust, Manitoba\\'s strategy to combat sexual exploitation and sex trafficking of children. Crucially, Manitoba\\'s government has committed more than $10 million Canadian a year to fund it, a huge sum for a population of only about a million people. \"Within a 10-year span Manitoba has really grown this massive strategy that is just recognized throughout Canada as being kind of the frontier leaders in this area,\" says Richardson. Read: \\'I was raped 43,200 times\\' The program is different and revolutionary for Manitoba because it uses not only targeted funds, but also words, deeds, and training to fight human trafficking in a whole new way. Outreach on neighborhood streets is one strategy that is executed with the help of law enforcement officers. Almost daily, Winnipeg Police dispatch an elite unit on the streets to try and counter sexual exploitation and human trafficking. The approach is a departure for Winnipeg Police, who now say their efforts are firmly focused on helping victims. Outreach is conducted in a way to help victims and then bring their perpetrators to justice. Law enforcement officials acknowledge a history of bias and racism that in the past prevented police from truly understanding how and why indigenous girls are vulnerable and at risk. \"There is bias in the police service. We recognize it, that there\\'s implicit bias. We certainly have taken steps to try to address that in a myriad of ways,\" says Danny Smyth, Winnipeg\\'s deputy police chief. \"We have a team that\\'s dedicated just to outreach. Just to being out there and trying to get to know who\\'s out on the street, and trying to establish a relationship with them,\" adds Smyth. The legacy of years of abuse and racism though are making it difficult for Canada\\'s indigenous community to heal and move on. Canada will soon launch an inquiry that will focus on why hundreds of indigenous women and girls have gone missing or been murdered over the years. Canadian and independent studies have revealed that indigenous women and girls are five times more likely to die in violent circumstances than non-indigenous women and girls. \"We\\'re still in a society that targets indigenous women and girls. In fact the national task force concluded that there\\'s a market for indigenous girls,\" says Redsky, adding, \"what that leads to is a society who views indigenous women as less than, and in fact of no human value.\"'],\n",
       " ['How child predator was caught by tiny clue in photo he posted online (CNN)In a bathroom, the predator has placed a child on the counter to photograph his evil acts. In the background of the photo, which was posted online, are products including prescription medication. But zooming in on that pill bottle makes the details unreadable. In a small, dark lab Jim Cole, special agent and supervisor of Victim Identification at the Homeland Security Investigations Cyber Crimes Center gets to work using the latest technology available. Using technology to identify abusers \"Utilizing some technology that hadn\\'t even been released to the public yet we were able to take a look at the bottle and reverse out some of the motion blur,\" Cole said. They can now see the offender\\'s first name \"Stephen,\" the first two letters of the last name and the first three digits on the prescription order. With that he applies to the pharmacy for the customer details of every person who fits that criteria. It narrows the list down to a man named \"Stephen Keating.\" But that\\'s not all. The offender\\'s fingers are also in the picture and incredibly this crack team manages to pull the fingerprints from the image. \"That was the first time we were able to do that,\" Cole said. The evidence was strong enough to put Stephen Keating behind bars for 110 years. Investigators rescued his 14 victims. No victim left behind Cole co-founded Project VIC: their aim is that no victim is be left behind. \"We strive to find these children as quick as possible,\" Cole said. \"The longer it takes us the longer that child is in harm\\'s way.\" Read: Raid reunites trafficked sisters It\\'s not an easy task when Cole says they are seeing 500,000 images a week: that\\'s over 25 million a year. The Keating case ran for about three weeks and in the past it could have taken months -- or worse, the image may never have been uncovered at all. Using technology known as \"Photo DNA\" their computers can wade through the hundreds of thousands of photos fast, categorizing the ones they\\'ve already seen to allow his team to focus on the new victims. \"What used to take us nine months now takes us a month,\" said Cole. \"It helps us review video on a scale of about 100 times faster than previously,\" he added. \"It\\'s been a complete game-changer for law enforcement and we get that feedback from the field all the time.\" Easing psychological burden The efficiency not only saves time, it helps ease the psychological burden on investigators. \"We definitely see a mental health benefit because the nature of our offenders is they are trading material we\\'ve seen hundreds of thousands of times in addition to the new material,\" Cole said. Read: Vietnamese girls smuggled in to China, sold as brides The technology helped investigators find a seemingly harmless photo of a known offender with her victim on vacation. The image showed the pair holding fish at a campsite. The fish were isolated from the image and sent to Cornell University, which provided investigators with a geographical area where those fish can be caught. The campsite image, with the child and perpetrator removed, was sent to every single campsite advertiser in that location. Upon tracking down the actual campsite they found the same photo posted in the reception room. \"Within four hours we had her identified,\" Cole said. The child was rescued and the woman is now serving a 25-year sentence. On another image of an offender with a young girl, the Project VIC team noticed a company logo on the man\\'s sweatshirt but they couldn\\'t decipher what was written. Some cutting edge technology helped make the logo almost completely readable. An online search for names that might match the letters led investigators to a plumbing business. The offender, a former employee, was tracked down and four victims were rescued. Global problem The number of images like these being shared online is on the rise. Last year the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) received 4.4 million reports to its CyberTipline. That\\'s a nearly 800% increase in reporting since 2013. Tip-offs come from the public, and also companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, who are mandated by U.S. regulations to report any such images. According to Lindsay Olson, director of the Exploited Child Division at NCMEC, 94% of the cases last year were outside the United States. \"The CyberTipline receives reports of child porn, online enticement of children for sexual acts, online sex trafficking, child molestation; any type of child exploitation can be reported to the cyber tip line,\" said Olson. \"We make reports available to law enforcement in about 100 countries and we also work with Europol and Interpol.\" Swedish based company Griffeye was one of the founding partners of Project VIC. Director Johann Hofmann says it donates its software to be used in child exploitation cases. \"As more and more crime is becoming more and more digital as data is being distributed online,\" he said. \"You see a new type of police officer that is behind a computer screen and with the right tools they can crack these cases.\" The Internet has no borders so law enforcement agencies need to overcome traditional geographic boundaries to work together. Project VIC is now being used by Interpol, Europol and agencies in 35 countries including the United Kingdom and Canada, and it\\'s about to be rolled out in Australia. In the United States the results speak for themselves. \"We\\'ve been absolutely floored by the success we\\'ve seen with Project VIC,\" said Cole. \"Going back a few years we were seeing victims in the low hundreds and in this past year we\\'ve rescued over 1,000 victims just in HSI (Homeland Security Investigations -- a division of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)). alone and we\\'ve seen similar results in other agencies as well.\"'],\n",
       " ['Vietnamese girls smuggled into China and sold as child brides The names of the trafficked girls in this story have been changed to protect their identities. Lan remembers the night that changed her whole life. While preparing for university along the border in northern Vietnam, a friend she met online asked her to a group dinner. When she was tired and wanted to go home, the people asked her to stay and talk and have a drink. Next thing she knew, she had been smuggled across the border to China. \"At that time, I wanted to leave,\" says Lan. \"There were other girls there in the car but there was people to guard us.\" The villages along the Vietnamese-Chinese border are a hunting ground for human traffickers. Girls as young as 13 say they are tricked or drugged, then spirited across the porous border by boat, motorbike or car. Young Vietnamese women are valuable commodities in China, where the one-child policy and long-standing preference for sons has heavily skewed the gender ratio. To put it simply, Chinese men are hungry for brides. \"It costs a very huge amount of money for normal Chinese man to get married to a Chinese woman,\" explained Ha Thi Van Khanh, national project coordinator for the U.N.\\'s anti-trafficking organization in Vietnam. Traditionally, Chinese men wishing to marry local women are expected to pay for an elaborate banquet and to have purchased a new home to live in after the wedding. \"This is why they try to import women from neighboring countries, including Vietnam.\" Diep Vuong started the Pacific Links Foundation to combat trafficking in Vietnam. She says that Vietnamese brides can sell for upwards of $3,000 to the end buyer and that they are often considered desirable because of cultural similarities to the Chinese. Nguyen was just 16 when a friend\\'s boyfriend drugged her and smuggled her into China. She tried to resist a forced marriage. For three months, she refused, even though her traffickers beat her, withheld food and threatened to kill her, she says. Finally, she relented. She says her husband was kind to her, but she never stopped missing her family in Vietnam. \"My desire to go home was indescribable,\" Nguyen said. \"I agreed to marry the man but I could not stay with a stranger without any feelings for him.\" When her mother-in-law realized Lan was never going to warm to the marriage, the family returned her to the traffickers. They got their money back, Nguyen says, after which she was forced into a second marriage. A refuge for escaped women The Pacific Links Foundation runs a shelter for trafficking victims in the city of Lao Cai, northern Vietnam. The young women stay for an average of two to three years. They go to school or get vocational training. They do art therapy. They learn to cook and sew and keep a big garden. Surrounded by other woman with similar experiences, the shelter helps them get back on their feet and then to find jobs to support themselves. \"Once that whole investment process can happen with these young women then it is much easier for them to have their own lives,\" says Diep. Her organization also does community outreach to try and stop more girls from falling into the hands of traffickers. About once a month, a group of trafficking victims visits the market at Bac Ha, a regional hub for buying food, fabric and livestock. On this day, on a stage overlooking hundreds of shoppers, they talk about their experiences, take questions and play games with the crowd. When they ask people to share personal experiences concerning trafficking, more than 20 people come forward. \"I think awareness is the only tool,\" Diep says. Ha from the U.N. agrees that the top priority is to spread awareness, especially in the poor, rural regions along the border. She also believes reducing poverty will help stop women going to China seeking work, another common way traffickers lure victims. Saved at the border During CNN\\'s trip to the border, the government called and told us the police had just rescued five girls as they were about to cross the border with a trafficker. We met the girls, who are just 14 years old. They said they were promised $600 to go to work in China by a neighbor from the same village. They didn\\'t tell their parents they were going. The neighbor is now under arrest. The Vietnamese police are sometimes able to rescue women even after they have crossed into China, by enlisting the help of Chinese authorities. Nguyen Tuong Long, the head of the government\\'s social vice prevention department in Lao Cai, says last year they rescued and returned 109 Vietnamese trafficking victims. \"Because of cooperation between the Vietnamese and the Chinese police, we have found and caught trafficking rings,\" Nguyen says. \"We\\'ve found women far inside China, at brothels where they\\'re forced to become sex workers.\" Trafficked women who aren\\'t rescued in raids have to find ways to get out on their own. Some of them say they were able to contact their families from China, but they couldn\\'t get help from police because they didn\\'t know exactly where they were. Lan and Nguyen ended up in the same town in China. After two years, together they managed to slip out of their homes and take a taxi to a local police station. The whole time they were afraid their husbands\\' families would find them. The Chinese police investigated and eventually returned them to Vietnam. The women were free of their forced marriages, but they paid a high price. Both left their babies in China. Lan says if she saw her daughter again, she would apologize for leaving her behind. \"I hope she\\'ll have a better life there,\" she says. Both Lan and Nguyen say in school their teachers had talked to them about trafficking. At the time, neither believed it could happen to them.'],\n",

WASHINGTON \"?Hundreds of state and national medical groups on Tuesday sent President Donald Trump-scientific evidence debunking the theory that childhood vaccines cause autism.- \"Claims that vaccines are unsafe when administered according to expert recommendations have been disproven by a robust body of medical literature, including a thorough review by the National Academy of Medicine,\"?reads the-letter, which was signed by groups including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics.- The medical groups attached summaries of more than three dozen studies that found no link between vaccines and neurological problems, and noted that immunization has eradicated several diseases in the U.S. Trump has repeatedly espoused the discredited theory that children can get autism from vaccines. He hosted Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a proponent of the autism theory, in January at Trump Tower in New York City. Kennedy said afterward that Trump had asked him to head a commission investigating vaccine safety.- A Trump spokeswoman previously said no decision had been made about whether to create a commission. The White House press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.-- Public health groups have been wary of wading into the political fray on vaccines, reluctant to give the impression that there\\'s any legitimate debate among scientists over whether people should have their children immunized. The letter had been in the works since Trump\\'s vaccine doubts resurfaced last month, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Several government bodies already vouch for the safety of vaccines, and nongovernment researchers have repeatedly probed the link between vaccines and autism since a 1998 paper first caused alarm.

Researchers found that people who switched from smoking regular cigarettes to e-cigarettes or nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) such as gum or patches for at least six months had much lower levels of toxins in their saliva and urine than those who continued to smoke. \"ourstudy adds to existing evidence showing that e-cigarettes and NRT are far safer than smoking, and suggests that there is a very low risk associated with their long-term use,\"?said Lion Shahab, a specialist in epidemiology and public health at University College London who led the work. E-cigarettes, which heat nicotine-laced liquid into vapor, have grown into an $8 billion-a-year market, according to Euromonitor International - more than three times that of NRT products. They are, however, still dwarfed by a tobacco market estimated by Euromonitor to be worth around $700 billion. Many health experts think e-cigarettes, or vapes, which do not contain tobacco, are a lower-risk alternative to smoking and potentially a major public health tool. But some question their long-term safety and worry that they may act as a \"gateway\"?to taking up conventional cigarettes. The U.S. surgeon general in December urged lawmakers to impose price and tax policies that would discourage their use. Monday\\'s study, published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, analyzed saliva and urine samples from long-term e-cigarette and NRT users as well as smokers, and compared levels of key chemicals found in their bodies. It found that smokers who switched completely to e-cigarettes or NRT had significantly lower levels of toxic chemicals and carcinogens compared to people who continued to smoke tobacco cigarettes. Those who used e-cigarettes or NRT but did not completely quit smoking did not show the same drop in toxin levels. This underlined that a complete switch was needed to get the long-term health benefits of quitting tobacco, the researchers said. The World Health Organization says tobacco is the world\\'s biggest preventable killer, with a predicted cumulative death toll of a billion by the end of this century if current trends continue. Tobacco smoking currently kills around 6 million people a year. Kevin Fenton, national director of health and wellbeing at the government authority Public Health England, said the findings held a clear message for tobacco smokers. \"Switching to e-cigarettes can significantly reduce harm to smokers, with greatly reduced exposure to carcinogens and toxins,\"?he said in a statement. \"the findings also make clear that the benefit is only realized if people stop smoking completely and make a total switch. \"the best thing a smoker can do, for themselves and those around them, is to quit now, completely and forever.\"?(Reporting by Kate Kelland; Editing by Kevin Liffey)'],\n",
       " ['Should scientists engage in activism? nan By Ivan Oransky, New York University and Adam Marcus, Johns Hopkins University Have you heard that scientists are planning a march on Washington? The move is not being billed as a protest, but rather as a \"celebration of our passion for science and a call to support and safeguard the scientific community,\" although it comes as a direct response to recent policy changes and statements by the Trump administration. Not everyone thinks the nonprotest protest is a good thing. It\\'s \"a terrible idea,\" wrote Robert Young, a geologist at Western Carolina University, in The New York Times. The march, Young said, will just reinforce a belief among some conservatives that \"scientists are an interest group,\" and polarize the issue, making researchers\\' jobs more difficult. Others find that argument less than convincing, pointing out that science and politics have always been intertwined. As the founders of the blog Retraction Watch and the Center for Scientific Integrity, we often see researchers reluctant to push for or embrace change - whether it\\'s to the conventional way of dealing with misconduct in journals (which for years was basically to not do so) or addressing problems of reproducibility of their experiments. To the timorous, airing dirty laundry, and letting the public in on the reality of science, could endanger public trust - and funding. So this isn\\'t the first time scientists and engineers have voiced similar concerns. Take the example of Marc Edwards and his colleagues at Virginia Tech: To many people watching the Flint water crisis, they were heroes. After being asked to visit by concerned residents, they found, and announced, that people in the beleaguered city were being exposed to excessive amounts of lead through their tap water. They also launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise money for water filters for city residents and created a website to push their findings about the hazards of the city\\'s water supply and shame governments at all levels to act. If not for their tireless efforts, thousands of children may have been exposed to dangerous amounts of lead for far longer than they already were. Even the Environmental Protection Agency has acknowledged that it waited too long to sound the alarm.   But that\\'s not exactly how the editor of a leading engineering journal sees things. In October, a remarkable editorial appeared in the journal Environmental Science & Technology. The essay, by University of California, Berkeley engineering professor and Water Center Director David Sedlak, ES&T\\'s editor-in-chief, expressed concern that some of his colleagues in the field had crossed the \"imaginary line\" between scientist and advocate. \"Speaking out against a corrupt or incompetent system may be the product of a culture where idealism, personal responsibility, and Hollywood\\'s dramatic sensibilities conspire to create a narrative about the noble individual fighting injustice,\" Sedlak wrote. By becoming \"allies of a particular cause, no matter how just, we jeopardize the social contract that underpins the tradition of financial support for basic research.\" In other words, don\\'t cross Congress - which many scientists already view as hostile to their profession - and risk retaliation in the form of budget cuts. That\\'s no small pie, either. Through its oversight of the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Energy and other agencies and programs, Congress holds the strings to a research purse worth nearly US$70 billion a year.  Let\\'s take a moment to absorb all that. Some (unnamed but easily identified) scientists, lulled by the media, have cast themselves as superheroes in a struggle against villains born of their own conceit. Their arrogance and vanity threaten to awaken the master, who will punish us all for the sins of a few. We rarely get the opportunity to watch a chilling effect in action, but you can almost see the breath of researchers caught up in a debate over the proper role of scientists in the crisis. It\\'s not just engineers who fear speaking out. \"We have too often been reluctant to voice our protest, for fear of incurring the [National Institute of Mental Health\\'s] displeasure (and losing whatever opportunities we still have for funding),\" wrote neuroscientist John Markowitz in The New York Times last fall. In a refreshing piece, Markowitz was arguing that \"there\\'s such a thing as too much neuroscience.\" As cofounders of Retraction Watch, a blog that focuses on some of science\\'s nasty episodes, we are occasionally admonished that pointing out cases of fraud - even when we also praise good behavior - will give anti-science forces ammunition. In some ways, we should be glad scientists are acknowledging these concerns, instead of pretending they\\'re never swayed by the almighty dollar. But anyone who clings to the notion that science exists in a pure vacuum, untainted by politics, economics or social justice needs also to understand that science is a human endeavor and scientists have the same eyes and ears for injustice and outrage as the rest of us. Although the conduct of science demands honesty and rigor, nowhere is it written that researchers must remain silent when governments or other powerful players either misuse science or suppress findings in the service of harmful policies. And before Edwards and his efforts on behalf of the Flint community, some scientists have spoken out. Claire Patterson, a physical chemist, put himself on a decades-long collision course with industry when he took on lead poisoning. John Snow earned the ire of Londoners when he removed the pump handle on a cholera-infested well, and wasn\\'t vindicated until after his death. It took Peter Buxtun several years to stop the infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiment; he eventually had to leak documents to reporter Jean Heller in 1972. Edwards and his colleagues, we would argue, are part of a long tradition of bridging the worlds of science and policy. They have been instrumental in bringing not only attention but change to the beleaguered city of Flint. And money: Thanks in part to their pressure, the Senate in September voted overwhelmingly to approve $100 million in aid for Flint, and hundreds of millions more in loans from the Environmental Protection Agency for upgrading municipal water infrastructures and studying exposure to lead.   In a stinging rebuke to Sedlak, Edwards and three coauthors - Amy Pruden, Siddhartha Roy and William Rhoads - blasted the critical editorial as a \"devastating, self-indictment of cowardice and perverse incentives in modern academia.\" Indeed, scientists who accept funding with the tacit agreement that they keep their mouths shut about the government are far more threatening to an independent academy than those who speak their minds. Since Nov. 8, it has been painfully clear that science will be playing defense for a while. The United States has never seen a regime so hostile to science and the value of the scientific method. President Donald Trump has declared climate change a \"hoax\" cooked up by the Chinese. He has flirted seriously with debunked anti-vaccination views and declared that polls (read, data) that are negative about his ambitions are \"fake news.\" Science and politics are not always compatible. And science need not always triumph over policy: After all, research shows that steroids improve athletic performance, but we have a compelling political interest to ban them. The same can be said of eugenics. Research must always be ethical, and ethics is a conversation that includes scientists and policymakers. Still, while the two domains are separate, the divide is, and should be, bridgeable. As Edwards and his colleagues write, \"The personal and professional peril is great, the critics are numerous and vocal, but staying silent is to be complicit in perpetrating injustice. And no matter what may come of the rest of our lives or careers, we are certain of one thing: Flint was a community worth going out on a limb for, and by upholding a just cause, we enhanced the social contract between academics and the public.\" That could easily be said of the March for Science. Except now it\\'s not just a limb but the entire tree that\\'s in peril.

       " ['How to Minimize Risks and Maximize Returns in Art Investments nan Many investors interested in alternative assets often shy away from art due to the overwhelming amount of risks and responsibilities that come with acquiring investment grade art. In this article, we identify these risks, and tell you how investing in art through Arthena will make you want to start today. Comparables, Experience and Costs: Needless to say, investment grade art is not the stock market or the real estate market where you can compare prices of one asset to another. With art assets, the ability to determine the legitimacy and the price, comes with expertise - this barrier makes it difficult for the traditional investor to confidently invest. When evaluating a work of art, art appraisers look for: Authenticity, condition, rarity, provenance, and value. Art appraisers\\' expertise can charge anywhere between $50 dollars to several hundreds of dollars an hour, and not all have equivalent experiences. Additional time is needed to ween out truly experienced art appraisers from those who are not. How can Arthena help? By investing through Arthena, we take away all the troubles of doing your own research, determining which work to purchase, placing the right bid, and hiring the right appraiser. At Arthena, we use our very own regression analysis to determine works of art to purchase for investment purposes. We organize artworks with similar core characteristics into logical groups according to their specific criteria, in accordance with USPAP (Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice) guidelines, which is also known as a IRS appraisal. The characteristics include artist, genre, date range, content, materials, size, coloration, and style, among others. Then, Arthena targets works by artists that have shown appreciation over the past 5 years and are projected to grow by 20% +/- YoY over the next five, or the lifetime of the fund. From storage to insurance, Arthena takes all these burdens away from the traditional art investor. By investing a minimum of $10k into our funds, we handle every troublesome task when it comes to acquiring a work of art. Just sit back, and watch your investment grow. Illiquidity: Generally, the art market is relatively illiquid in comparison to traditional assets such as equities and stocks. Therefore, art assets are ideal for long-term investments. That being said, there is varying liquidity within the art market itself. Determined by the difference between the ask and bid price, the lower the bid price from the ask price, the more illiquid the asset is. The greater the bid is from the ask price, the more liquid it is. Let Arthena identify the art market\\'s most liquid assets: Arthena acquires works in the emerging, PWC, and Modern market sectors, which in total account for over 70% of the US market, and have shown the highest rate of growth over the past 10 years. Art market analysts have identified the most liquid sector of the art market are works of art under $250,000. Arthena confirms that the artist and art work fit our growth metrics, rate at 1 or above for Sharpe Ratio, to confirm that it is a high growth investment with low volatility, and determine its maximum acquisition price Lack of Data: Many reports have noted upon the lack of transparency in the art market. As a result, companies have created indices such as Mei Moses and Artnet index to amend this \"problem\". Nonetheless, these indices bring in a new set of issues. Such indices as the two mentioned do not encompass the entire art market. For example, Mei Moses\\'s data lies primarily on numbers from Sotheby\\'s and Christie\\'s, negating their online sales as well as other auction houses and private sales. Another problem is that some indexes rely heavily on repeat sales, but does not include bought in lots, which variates some data. How Arthena operates through transparency: As such, Arthena acquires works at auction for increased price transparency to the benefit of our investors and our methodology. When works from Arthena\\'s index of artists appear at auction, Arthena uses regression modeling to determine maximum acquisition price. Once acquired, investors can view their art collection through Arthena\\'s online dashboard, allowing our clients to have full access into their investments.  Stock market vs. art market performance: Multiple art market analysts have determined that the art market has a low correlation to the stock market, while other analysts have deemed that there is still a certain level of correlation between the two because of the notion that investors would only spend disposable income on collectibles and luxury assets when the market is bullish rather than vice versa. Regardless, the art market has proven itself to be a great store of wealth especially during times of economic uncertainty. Notably, it only took the art market 16 months to return to pre-recession levels in 2008, while the stock market took six years. As such, according to Deloitte: \"Increasing awareness of art as an asset class: 53% of wealth managers had a high level of awareness of developments linked to art as an asset class, up from 43% in 2012 and 33% in 2011; this signals that increasing attention is being paid by the wealth management community to the art and collectibles market.\" - Deloitte and ArtTactic Art & Finance Report 2014  Arthena takes a new approach to investing in art. Like a hedge fund, Arthena identifies specific market segments and artists that have shown impressive historical performance and creates buy orders to acquire said works.

       " ['Progressives Hang Onto Hopes For Ivanka Trump Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) hopes President Donald Trump would be receptive to a paid family leave plan because his daughter has spoken about the issue. WASHINGTON \"?Progressives wondering whether President Donald Trump will give any notice to their concerns hold out hope that his daughter Ivanka will intervene. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), a longtime champion of paid family leave, on Tuesday reintroduced her Family Act, which would guarantee 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave for all workers. The legislation, which proposes a universal paid leave program funded by a small payroll tax, failed to advance in the previous session of the Republican-led Congress, and likely faces the same fate under Trump. But Gillibrand and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), sponsor of a companion bill in the House, on Tuesday expressed optimism that the president would be receptive, in part because Ivanka Trump has spoken about the issue. \"I am hopeful that the administration will reach out to me and work with me on a national paid leave plan,\"?Gillibrand said on a call with reporters. Gillibrand referenced Ivanka Trump\\'s speech at last summer\\'s Republican National Convention, in which she presented her father, who has a record of demeaning women, as a champion for women\\'s rights and a supporter of equal pay for women. It led many progressives to hope that her influence would encourage-\"?or at least make it possible \"?that the president pivot from his campaign promises. Ivanka Trump also tried during the campaign to deflect attention away from her father\\'s history of misogyny and climate change denial. Last week, Ivanka Trump and husband Jared Kushner, a senior White House adviser, reportedly convinced the president not to roll back LGBTQ protections, a important achievement of former President Barack Obama. Trump\\'s proposed paid leave plan, like most of his policy proposals, contains little substance and is limited in scope. It allows for six weeks of paid leave, and only applies to mothers. Ivanka Trump said in an interview when her father\\'s leave plan was announced in September that it is intended to \"help mothers in recovery in the immediate aftermath of childbirth.\"?She would not elaborate on whether it would apply to LGBTQ, adoptive or foster parents, or people caring for aging parents. \"we\\'ll wait to see what the dimensions of it, what the details are,\"?DeLauro said of Trump\\'s proposal.- \"I don\"t know when they will move forward with making a substantive proposal,\"?she added. \"We\\'r waiting for them to join the debate. We\\'r on the field. The U.S. remains the only industrialized country without mandated paid family leave. Sunday was the 24th anniversary of the Family Medical Leave Act, which provides 12 weeks of unpaid leave for people who work at companies with more than 50 employees. The push for universal paid leave is growing, with state legislatures and businesses enacting more expansive plans. Gillibrand said she hopes to gain bipartisan support because the issue affects everyone. \"Despite the fact that we don\"t have a Republican yet, I am optimistic that people will be demanding action on this issue, that people will rise up and say we need a national paid leave plan, and really call on their elected leaders to listen to the challenges that they\\'r facing,\"?Gillibrand said. \"I am hopeful that the new administration will focus on it because they did run on it, they did talk about it, and it should be nonpartisan.\"?,-1\"'],\n",

Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) also pointed to \"the good things\" that came from the shooting of black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina. Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) vehemently defended President Donald Trump\\'s ban on refugees and travelers Tuesday, arguing that terrorists who come from the Middle East are an existential threat to the United States and totally different from white domestic terrorists,-who just commit \"Ane-off\"?incidents that the government can\"t do anything about.- Duffy said Trump was justified in stopping Syrian refugees from entering the United States \"until in Syria they figure out this conflict in the civil war and this hotbed for terrorism.\"?Presumably, however, once the conflict is over, women and children, for example, won\"t feel it is as necessary to escape their country to find a safe haven.- Host Alisyn Camerota pressed Duffy on Trump claiming that the media were intentionally covering up terrorist attacks and either not reporting or underreporting them. The White House later Monday released a list of 78 attacks it said backed up Trump\\'s claim. The list notably did not include a recent attack on Muslims inside a Quebec City mosque that killed six people. Trump, who frequently tweets about terrorist attacks, also has not mentioned this one.- Duffy argued in his CNN interview that attacks by white people \"?such as the one in Quebec City \"?aren\"t as big of a problem.- \"You don\"t have a group like ISIS or al Qaeda that is inspiring people around the world to take up arms and kill innocents. That was a one-off. That was a one-off, Alisyn,\"?Duffy said. Camerota then pointed to the massacre of black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015 and the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, as acts carried out by white terrorists. Duffy tried to make lemonade out of the Charleston attack, in which a white supremacist killed nine people:- CAMEROTA: How about Charleston, congressman? He was an extremist. He was a white extremist?- DUFFY: Yes, he was. OK? CAMEROTA: How about that? That doesn\"t matter?- DUFFY: No, it does matter. It does matter. Look at the good things that came from it. [Then-South Carolina Gov.] Nikki Haley took down the Confederate flag, that was great.- But you want to say I can give you a couple of examples. There\\'s no constant threat that goes through these attacks. And you have radical Islamic terrorists and ISIS that are driving the attacks, and if you want to compare those two, maybe you can throw another one \"\\x95Â?CAMEROTA: You can.- Duffy claimed that people on the left were manufacturing outrage, saying there was plenty of blame to go around.- \"Look at Gabby Giffords. The Marxist, who took her life, a leftist guy, and now you see violence and terror in the streets all across America, burning and beating people with Donald Trump hats. The violence you have to look in, you\\'r trying to use examples on the right,\"?he said. Former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.) is not dead. As a congresswoman in 2011, she survived an assassination attempt, and she remains an outspoken proponent of gun safety reform. Duffy said he be happy to help do something about white supremacy but he just didn\"t know what to do: \"Can we vet that? How should we vet that to keep ourselves safe? I will join you in that effort, what do you do?\"?- Watch Duffy\\'s full interview below:- Camerota: Why isn\\'t the president talking about white terrorism? Duffy: There\\'s a difference. https://t.co/YEgSitUsdS The Southern Poverty Law Center has tracked radical-right terrorist plots that have occurred since the Oklahoma City bombing and has a list here.- There have been zero fatal terrorist attacks on U.S. soil since 1975 by immigrants from the seven countries listed in Trump\\'s executive order.

       " ['I Was Ghosted 3 Times In The Last Year. Here Are 6 Things I Learned. Hello? Helllllllllllllo? Ah, dating in the 21st century. If disappointing websites, drug-resistant STIs and troublingly short attention spans weren\"t enough to make us lose our minds (and possibly our libidos), we\\'r also now stuck grappling with another modern phenomenon: ghosting. The New York Times defines ghosting as \"ending a romantic relationship by cutting off all contact and ignoring the former partner\\'s attempts to reach out.\"?This has happened to me three times in the past year. Granted, I don\"t believe it necessarily needs to be a \"relationship\"?in the traditional sense in order for one party to be ghosted. It could (or should) also include entanglements that involved meeting up or hanging out or hooking up with someone two or more times before the other person vanished without a trace. I haven\"t been in a formal relationship in almost four years, but I frequently meet guys that I find worthy of getting to know better (both with and without my clothes on) and the exchanges that result from those interactions are meaningful to me in one way or another \"?at least meaningful enough to want some closure if or when they end. After investing some time and energy and possibly saliva or other body fluids in another person, it\\'s disconcerting when they suddenly disappear. Of course, if you\\'re only been on one or two \"dates\"?(however you want to define that term) with someone and at the end of your time together neither of you reaches out to the other, that\\'s not ghosting. That\\'s just life.-And I understand that dating is hard and that finding someone who ticks \"?or if we\\'r really lucky, tickles \"?all of our boxes is virtually impossible but I still (perhaps naively) cling to the (perhaps now radical and totally outdated) idea that it\\'s a mature move to give someone a heads up if you\\'r going to stop talking or seeing or fucking them. So, in light of my experiences over the past year, here are a few humble and totally unscientific thoughts on ghosting: 1. Just don\"t do it. Be an adult and send a text that reads something like: \"Hey. Glad we hung out but I\\'m just not feeling a connection. Stay awesome\"?or whatever other generic and possibly hurtful or patronizing or maybe just uncomfortable (but at least emotionally clear) and instructive language you want to use. I\\'ll respect you for it even if it bums me out and that way neither of us has to dread randomly running into the other at Whole Foods or at that bar with all those vintage pinball machines that I stupidly and regretfully introduced you to because I thought you were cool (or at least we won\"t experience more than the usual basic human level of dread that accompanies those kinds of surprise social interactions). 2. If you do it, do not \"?as two of the three guys who originally ghosted me have done \"?start texting me again three to four weeks later and pretend like nothing happened as if you unexpectedly slipped into a coma and then suddenly woke up again or went on a hot air balloon trip around the world and didn\"t have access to your phone and just forgot to tell me. The only thing worse than ghosting is re-materializing a month later \"?and I mean worse for both of us because at that point, I\"ve had all that time to think about how bad your taste in music actually is or question a million other questionable things you told me in our short time together and now that I\"ve thought about it, I don\"t want to see you again. 3. Being ghosted made me realize I\"ve probably ghosted guys in the past-(and now that I\\'m publishing this piece, I\\'m guessing one or two or 74 of you will come forward and say as much). If I ghosted you, I\\'m sorry. I was an asshole. I was immature. And I was probably scared of hurting your feelings or just didn\"t know how to verbalize why I didn\"t want to see you again. Chances are it was something innocuous and had nothing to do with your character. And I\\'m sure if you asked any of the guys who ghosted me, they say exactly the same things. But that doesn\"t excuse it and going forward I\\'m vowing taking my own advice, no matter how awkward it might feel. 4. Human beings are finicky creatures and, what\\'s more, as our cultural ideas about and understanding of what dating and relationships and couples and families look like continues to shift and destabilize,-linking up and breaking apart is probably only going to get trickier. These days many of us aren\"t looking to get married or have kids (or at least aren\"t looking to get married and have kids the way our parents or our grandparents-did) and so, the way we think about how we enter and exit relationships is mutating and not always in ideal ways, which means we have to be even more mindful of our (in)actions. 5. Communicating is hard \"?and getting harder.-As much as I think the guys who ghosted me suck, I get it. And in many ways, aside from reminding me to treat others the way I\\'d like to be treated, being ghosted also has made me rethink who and what I\\'m looking for in a partner or a fuck buddy \"?or just someone I want to go and have a donut with. What\\'s more, it\\'s made me rethink how I communicate with other human beings in general and reevaluate what the best way is to express myself and my needs and my desires to friends and family and colleagues, too. Email and texts make it easy to send a message but we have to stop to think about the quality of those messages. And are those forms of communication appropriate for what we need to say?-What is the value of face to face contact and experiencing the world offline? What are the best ways to grow a relationship and how often do I rely on technology as a crutch to deal with \"?or get out of \"?something? These are all questions that have been pacing the hallways in my head lately and it feels good (or at least productive) to think about them. 6. Ghosting aside, there\\'s something kind of nice about dating as a 38-year-old because I know what I want better than I did when I was 25 or even 32 and I put up with less shit. And if, in the end, someone doesn\"t text me back, the truth is I\\'m totally happy to spend Friday night watching \"the Great British Bakeoff\"?all by myself (maybe, if I\\'m being totally honest, even happier).'],\n",
       " ['Despite Ban, These Orthodox Jewish Clergywomen Are Determined To Serve Not even a ban from the religious establishment will stop these women from fulfilling their calling. The Orthodox Union, one of the largest-networks of Orthodox Jewish synagogues in America, recently adopted a policy that bans women from serving as clergy.- Opinions about whether women should be allowed to serve as clergy have caused some division within America\\'s Modern Orthodox Jewish community. The religious establishment, including the OU\\'s counterpart, the Rabbinical Council of America,-is strongly opposed to women\\'s ordination.-On the other hand, some OU synagogues have embraced the idea of women clergy. The new policy attempts to clear up the confusion. But despite the enforcement of this glass ceiling, Orthodox women who have felt the pull to serve as spiritual leaders aren\"t backing away from their calling.- Rabba Sara Hurwitz is the co-founder and Dean of Yeshivat Maharat, an-Orthodox Jewish seminary that ordains women as clergy. The school has graduated 14 female clergy and 28 others are currently students. Hurwitz told The Huffington Post that nine of the their graduates are currently employed in synagogues. She said students remain committed to \"learning, teaching, being a pastoral presence for people in their time joy and vulnerability, and being a role model for others.\"?\"their reaction [to the policy] is to keep marching forwards, fulfilling their passion to become clergy,\"?she wrote in an email. The OU\\'s decision comes down to a difference in opinion about God\\'s will for men and women. According to a statement, OU leaders said that they had been approached by Orthodox rabbis and lay leadership for definitive guidance about women\\'s ordination. The OU placed the question in front of a group of seven modern Orthodox rabbis. After months of reviews and forums with community members, the panel concluded that more should be done to encourage women towards leadership positions. However, their interpretation of Jewish law found that men and women have-different gender roles and obligations when it comes to serving in a synagogue. OU leaders argued that the idea of gender equality in religious practice \"inexorably clashes\"?with the Orthodox interpretation of Jewish scripture. In their worldview, individual autonomy must always submit to the will of God, as interpreted by rabbinic leaders. The rabbis agreed that women can serve as administrators, educators, and counselors. They can even advise other women about Jewish law as it relates to marriage, sexuality and women\\'s health.- But on the matter of ordination, the rabbis concluded that women weren\"t allowed. As a result, the OU adopted a policy on February 1 that discourages-member synagogues from employing-women clergy, or allowing women to perform tasks typically associated with clergy \"\\x95Â\\xa0such as officiating at significant life-cycle events, delivering sermons from the pulpit, and serving as a synagogue\\'s primary religious teacher. Instead of focusing on what women are prohibited from doing, the leaders asked the community to focus on what women are allowed to do.- \"Women must be encouraged to share their Torah knowledge, and their enthusiasm and wisdom, with the broader community,\"?the leaders said in a statement. \"Let us focus our energy and communal creativity on increasing and enhancing the contributions that women make to our shuls and communities, rather than being consumed with limitations.\"?But some female Orthodox clergy are determined not to let these restrictions stop them from acting as spiritual leaders. Maharat Ruth Balinsky Friedman, an ordained spiritual leader at Washington D.C.\\'s Ohev Sholom - The National Synagogue, told The Huffington Post that she\\'s determined to keep doing her job. \"I am grateful to have an extremely supportive community, and so this decision does not affect me personally. However, some of my colleagues are personally affected, and this decision caused them a lot of upset and worry,\"?she told The Huffington Post in an email. \"therefore, my top reaction is one of anger.-That these rabbis made this decision without considering the effects it would have on the women who are currently serving as clergy, or who are training to serve, is disgraceful.\"?The OU\\'s statement does not explicitly state whether the rabbinic panel listened to ordained women\\'s voices and opinions during the review process. The Huffington Post\\'s requests for comment were not returned. The Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance, a group that advocates for expanded roles for women within the community, was \"dismayed\"?by the OU\\'s decision.- \"there are various ways of practicing Judaism, halachic Orthodox Judaism,\"?Sharon Weiss-Greenberg, the group\\'s executive director, told the Forward. \"We are disappointed, however, that the OU is attempting to squash that healthy debate and impose their [religious ruling] on hundreds of synagogues, thus centralizing power\"?and not giving autonomy to communities\"?lay and professional leaders.\"?Bracha Jaffe, a member of Yeshivat Maharat\\'s Class of 2017, is still hoping to take the title of \"rabba\"?after her ordination this year. She told The Huffington Post that she feels the forum doesn\"t reflect the diversity within the Orthodox community. She said the OU\\'s decision has encouraged her and her colleagues to \"do our work in a more public fashion\"?to raise their visibility.- \"\\x9cVisible female clergy presence in Orthodox synagogues lends validity to women\\'s participation, gives voice to the women\\'s side and creates a welcoming space and role models for women of all ages in our synagogues,\"?Jaffe told The Huffington Post. \"Let us not deprive the Orthodox world of what these talented and dedicated women have to offer!\"?,-1\"'],\n",

       " ['Inspired By Erotic Arabic Poetry, Women Artists Depict Radical Love \"Radial Love: Female Lust\" features 48 women artists from around the world interpreting ancient poetry. Wallada bint al-Mustakfi was an Andalusian poet who lived and wrote in 11th-century Spain,-sometimes sewing her verses onto the trim of her transparent tunics and wearing them around town. The daughter of a caliph, Wallada eventually inherited her father\\'s palace and transformed it into a literary hall where she\\'dmentor young women of all backgrounds in poetry and the arts. Her poems mixed themes of spiritual worship and erotic yearning \"?sometimes exalting her beloved, other times scolding the lovers who had done her wrong. She wrote: \"I am made for higher goals and by Allah I am going my way with pride. I allow my lover to touch my cheek And bestow my kiss to him who craves it.\"When Irish born, London-based actress R¨®is¨ªn O\\'Loughlin unexpectedly encountered Wallada\\'s poems last year, she was struck by how contemporary they felt. \"they read like the best pop lyrics,\"?O\\'Loughlin said in a statement. \"Short and sweet in their intense defiance, desire, lovesick longing, pride and fun.\"?In an email to The Huffington Post,-O\\'Loughlin said they reminded her of the songs of contemporary songstress FKA Twigs, who infuses her erotic lyrics with hints of spiritual reverence.- Astounded by her discovery, O\\'Loughlin began to research other women poets from the ancient Arab world. She landed upon the collection of Abdullah al-Udhari, comprised of verses written by women between the 7th and 12th centuries. Like Wallada, the other ancient poets spun verses that praised pleasures both carnal and divine with the same fearless breath.-One piece by 11th-century poet Itimad al-Rumaykiyya reads: \"I urge you to come faster than the wind to mount my breast and firmly dig and plough my body, and don\"t let go until you\\'re flushed me thrice.\"?Lyrics like these \"?lavish and unapologetic \"?contradict the persistent, patriarchal myths that cast women, and especially women of Muslim faith, as submissive or silent. These ancient Arabic poets revealed that for millennia, women of various backgrounds, classes and faiths have expressed their feelings and beliefs in no uncertain terms, through passages that vibrate with conviction and lust, sometimes directed toward another person, and alternately, toward life itself.- \"I was really attracted to the poems, in part, because they didn\"t have any agenda,\"?O\\'Loughlin told HuffPost. \"Today the idea of empowerment is sold to us. It\\'s become an advertising tool used to sell dresses or soap. These artists, their way of speaking, just felt really free. They felt like celebrations of life.\"?Inspired by these visionary poets whose words still resonate centuries later,-O\\'Loughlin brainstormed how to usher this little-known pocket of ancient, erotic feminist literature into contemporary discussions, in a time so many of the stereotypes regarding femininity, Islam and the Arab World still persist. She decided to match present-day artists with their poetic predecessors, inviting women of today to create visual testimonies to accompany the written works that came before them.- O\\'Loughlin collected 24 total poems from Arabic women poets \"?most are Muslim, though one is Jewish and one predates Islam. She recruited two female contemporary artists from different cultural and artistic traditions to craft an artistic responses to each poem. The resulting exhibition, called \"radical Love: Female Lust,\"?features 48 artworks made by women around the world, approximately half of whom are of Arab descent. Hailing from countries including Syria, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Lebanon, Egypt, Russia, America, Pakistan and Ghana, the featured artists use ancient Arabic poetry as a point of departure, visualizing desire and worship in a dizzying array of manifestations.- The show will take place at the Crypt Gallery in London, a former burial ground located beneath a church. According to O\\'Loughlin, \"Here the words of these poets who have been silenced are given voice again, and in doing so the desire for life that is present in the female rises in the work of the modern artist.\"?The curator funded the entire exhibition herself, and is currently crowdfunding on Generosity to help with the cost. She hopes to earn enough to divide all proceeds from the show between the participating artists and the Global Fund for Women,-helping Syrian refugees who have relocated to Lebanon.- The image above, a print by by Saudi artist Hend al-Mansour, was inspired by the poet Juml, a young Bedouin woman who, in 9th-century Iraq, served as a concubine to poet Idris Ibn Abi Hafsah. Al-Mansour riffed off the style of the Arabic storybook Maqamat Badi\"?al-Zaman al-Hamadhani,-adding splashes of neon pink and her heroine\\'s salty expression.- Another work, by Dublin-based photographer Deborah Sheedy titled \"I Keep my Passion to Myself,\"?was inspired by a poem by Zahra. Her airy, black-and-white photo depicts a woman spinning in a white dress, appearing like something between an embodied human and imagined chimera. The photo-\"?blurred and bubbling from the edges \"?transforms what photographers often construe as mistakes into opportunities for additional experimentation and play.- The motley assemblage of artists have a few things in common:-urgency, a desire to express core emotions like strength, vulnerability and love. \"they are a deliberate and timeless resistance to the silencing and patronizing of females,\"?O\\'Loughlin added. \"Whatever external restraints were placed on these women, they retained a vitality and independence of spirit, a powerful tonic to these troubling times.\"O\\'Loughlin originally began researching ancient Arabic poetry in 2015 -Before Brexit, before Trump\\'s election, and before the president\\'s-executive order barring immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations. Islamophobia and the xenophobic myths that such thinking engenders were palpable then. \"I was shocked by Brexit and I was shocked by Donald Trump being elected,\"?she said. \"But I was aware that people were being reduced to their ethnicity or their faith.\"?Through her exhibition, O\\'Loughlin hoped to reveal the futility of defining human beings through such sweeping labels,-demonstrating the depth and difference that exist within every cultural category.- \"It\\'s crazy that the word \"Muslim\"?is being described to define millions of people who are from different places and cultures,\"?O\\'Loughlin continued. \"people from Pakistan or Palestine or Algeria come from such distinct cultures. And every single woman has a different relationship to God.\"?Subsequently, the featured artists in her exhibition do not disclose their faiths alongside their work. That, O\\'Loughlin expressed, is an aspect of themselves they are not compelled to explain to anyone. \"they are women and artists, that\\'s all they have to be.\"?Radical Love: Female Lust-is on view Crypt Gallery, St Pancras, London from Feb. 14 through March 5.

       " ['A Valentine For POTUS nan Dear POTUS, This year, I\\'m sending you a Valentine, not because I love you or respect you, but because I love my country. And you are the duly-elected symbol of that country. You may not know that I love my country, since I\\'m not in the pro-life movement, I don\\'t attend church, fear immigrants, or verbally wave the flag every chance I get. I\\'m not even Christian, which I suspect is becoming ground zero for patriotism. In fact, I pretty much don\\'t fit any of the recent descriptions used for those who love our country. My love of country stems, instead, from deep, unwavering gratitude. Gratitude that my parents were allowed to emigrate here, and that this country made room for them. Gratitude that I was given a childhood that was dramatically different than theirs. Gratitude that my life choices were those of people who have enough food to eat, a home to live in, and a government that protects them and not hunts them down. I had only to decide which clothes to wear for school that day, which homework assignment should be done first, and which children\\'s shows I would look forward to seeing on TV over the weekend. These were decisions my parents never got to consider when they were growing up. I also love my country because my experience growing up was that people of different religions living together was entirely normal. My friends were Jewish, Protestant, Catholic. We attended the same school, borrowed books from the same library, watched movies on Saturday morning at the same theater. My parents did not experience this. Because of their religion, they lived only where the government allowed them to live. Their lives were so insular that they never learned the languages of the countries in which they lived. This is what I\\'d like you to understand, that, because of who I am and because of the circumstances of my family history, I love my country. You and I speak the same language, and we may use the same terms, but I may mean something a bit different than you when I do so. For example: pro-life: My belief is that life is sacred, and that being pro-life means that we have an obligation to those, like my parents, who seek asylum within our borders. And we have an obligation to those who live here now, to be inclusive. Pro-life means not shutting them out, either economically, socially, or educationally. I do not believe that they are here to suck us dry or kill us. I believe they are, like my parents, here to have a chance at a better life. \"radical Islamic terrorism\": a favorite term of yours. You\\'ll be happy to know that I believe radical Islamic terrorism exists and that it is a threat to us and to the world. I also believe radical non-Islamic terrorism exists. It has resulted in Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma City bombing, Dylann Roof and the Charleston Church shooting, Adam Lanza and the Newtown School shooting, Charles Roberts and the Amish school shooting, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold and the Columbine High School massacre. The list goes on and on. Terrorism, no matter its motivation, is unacceptable. \"government-run education monopoly\" Democracies depend on the educational system they provide their citizens. Corporations that are monopolies have consumers at their mercy, and may set prices to increase profit. They don\\'t have to consider the welfare of the people who use their products or services. Education, as a monopoly, ensures that common standards are upheld. They are beholden to the people who use their services. There is a big difference between a business and an educational system. People of means will always have the option of sending their children to private school, just as people of faith will always have the option of sending their children to faith-based school. And people will (and should) have the option of home-schooling or sending their children to charter schools. But none of these alternatives should impact in any way whatsoever on the public school system that the vast majority of Americans attend. Alternatives mean choice, not the standard. \"fake news\": I agree wholeheartedly that fake news exists. But, in this era of unlimited avenues in which people can gather information, it\\'s irresponsible to accept any news (no matter where it comes from) without checking sources. If you limit yourself solely to one source or one way of thinking, you become vulnerable to manipulation. And that is a very dangerous place to be. A free society is based on a free press. It is not up to any leader of this country to decide what people should read and/or listen to. It is up to us, the people,to do due diligence to weed through news sources, in order to make ourselves better-informed citizens. I also have definitions that differ from yours, regarding what it would take to \"make America great again\" and \"make the inner cities safe\" and \"keep our borders safe.\" I will happily share them with you, if you\\'d like. So, here\\'s your Valentine, POTUS, from a grateful-to-be-here patriot of this amazing country. I suspect that no matter what path you choose to lead this country down for the foreseeable future, I will make my opinion known. I will continue to exercise the right that was not given to my parents. And I will continue to love this country as much as anyone possibly can and to get chills whenever I say the Pledge of Allegiance or sing the national anthem.'],\n",
       " ['Brexit rebellion avoided after \\'meaningful vote\\' offer The government has seen off an attempt to add conditions to its Brexit bill as a Conservative rebellion was avoided. The government has seen off an attempt to add conditions to its Brexit bill as a Conservative rebellion was avoided. MPs rejected a bid by Labour\\'s Chris Leslie to force the government to consult Parliament on the deal struck with the EU before it is finalised. It came after ministers pledged that a \"meaningful\" vote would be offered. Labour and some Tories had pushed for MPs to have a decisive say on the final terms, but the 326 to 293 vote means the bill remains unchanged. MPs are still debating other elements of the draft legislation, which will authorise the prime minister to formally begin Brexit negotiations under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Theresa May has already promised Parliament will get a say on the final deal, but critics, including some Conservatives, said they wanted more than the \"take it or leave it\" vote being offered. Any possibility of a Conservative rebellion appeared to be halted by comments from Brexit Minister David Jones. Mr Jones said MPs would get a say on the final draft Brexit agreement before it was voted upon by the European Parliament. \"This will be a meaningful vote,\" he told MPs. \"It will be the choice of leaving the EU with a negotiated deal or not.\" However, some MPs questioned whether any concessions had in fact been offered. Asked what would happen if Parliament rejected the Brexit deal or if there was no agreement with the EU to vote upon, Mr Jones said that in each scenario the UK would still leave the EU but \"fall back on other arrangements\". This would effectively see the UK default to World Trade Organization trade rules, involving potential tariffs on exports and imports. Opponents of Brexit have said this would cause real damage to British business, but supporters say the UK can live with the consequences if necessary as the UK would then be free to negotiate its own trade arrangements. Mr Jones said the government wanted to avoid a situation in which ministers were sent back to the negotiating table to hammer out a better deal. This, he said, would be hard given the two-year limit for talks and would also be \"the surest way of undermining our negotiating position and delivering a worse deal\". Former chancellor Ken Clarke - the only Tory to vote against kickstarting the Brexit process last week - said Parliament should have the opportunity to shape the final deal, while former SNP leader Alex Salmond said MPs should have a genuine choice without the \"Sword of Damocles\" hanging over them. Labour\\'s Chuka Umunna said the choice facing MPs was \"unacceptable\", Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg described it as a \"symbolic handout\" while Green Party leader Caroline Lucas said MPs were being \"duped\". But Labour\\'s font bench claimed the move as a \"significant victory\" in response to its repeated demands for a \"meaningful\" vote at the end of the two-year negotiation process. The party withdrew its proposed amendment before Mr Leslie\\'s was defeated. MPs, who overwhelmingly backed the European Union Bill last Wednesday, are currently in the middle of three further days of more detailed debate, with the Commons looking at amendments proposed by MPs. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who backed the Remain side in last year\\'s EU referendum, has ordered his MPs to support the government\\'s bill, whether his party\\'s amendments are accepted or not. If passed by Parliament - with the House of Lords due to scrutinise it after the Commons - the bill would allow Prime Minister Theresa May to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, getting divorce talks with the EU under way. Mr Corbyn argues that it would be undemocratic to ignore the will of the people, as expressed in last June\\'s EU referendum. Shadow business secretary Clive Lewis has vowed to oppose the bill unless Labour amendments are passed in the Commons. Frontbench members of parties are generally expected to resign from their post if they ignore a three-line whip.'],\n",
       " ['Speaker John Bercow defends his comments on Donald Trump Commons Speaker John Bercow has defended voicing his opposition to Donald Trump addressing Parliament. Commons Speaker John Bercow has defended voicing his opposition to Donald Trump addressing Parliament. His comments, including accusing the US president of \"racism and sexism\", had been made \"honestly and honourably\" and were within his remit, he told MPs. Several Conservatives have criticised the Speaker, one saying his career could be in \"jeopardy\" and another that he had damaged the national interest. Downing Street called his comments \"a matter for Parliament\". The US president has accepted an invitation from the Queen for a state visit to the UK, which can include an address to both Houses of Parliament, later this year. However, responding to a point of order in the Commons on Monday, Mr Bercow said he was opposed to Mr Trump speaking to MPs and peers - as some other international leaders have done. He said it was \"not an automatic right\", but an \"earned honour\", to applause from Labour and SNP MPs. Questioned in the Commons on Tuesday about his remarks, he replied: \"The House has always understood that the chair has a role in these matters.\" He added: \"I was honestly and honourably seeking to discharge my responsibilities to the House.\" Mr Bercow said it was time \"to move on to other matters\". Conservative MP Sir Gerald Howarth said there had been a \"rather subdued aspect\" among his party\\'s MPs when Mr Bercow had spoken. He added: \"I do hope that you will help us to ensure that we can have full confidence in your impartiality, because that\\'s the way for the House to proceed.\" The \"relationship between the United Kingdom and United States is an extremely important one\", Sir Gerald also said. However, Labour MP Paul Flynn said the Commons owed Mr Bercow \"a debt of gratitude for deciding that in this case such an invitation should not be supported by this House.\" And SNP MP Alex Salmond, who had several run-ins with Mr Trump when he was Scottish First Minister, told Mr Bercow: \"If ever a statement deserved clapping, then yours did yesterday.\" Mr Bercow is one of three \"key holders\" to Westminster Hall - where Mr Trump\\'s predecessor Barack Obama spoke in 2011 - along with the Speaker of the House of Lords, Lord Fowler, and the Lord Great Chamberlain, a hereditary peer in charge of certain parts of the Palace of Westminster. All three must agree in order for an address to take place there. Lord Fowler addressed peers on Tuesday, saying Mr Bercow had not informed him ahead of voicing his opinion on Mr Trump, adding that Mr Bercow had told him he was \"genuinely sorry\" for this. He added: \"I don\\'t intend to argue the case for or against Mr Trump\\'s visit. That\\'s not my role as Speaker. \"But let me say I have spent the last 30 years campaigning against discrimination, particularly against LGBT people and people with HIV/Aids.\" As speaker, Mr Bercow is the highest authority of the House of Commons and must remain politically impartial. Several senior Conservatives have been highly critical of his comments. One unnamed Tory MP and former cabinet member told the BBC he \"must be close to standing down\" as Speaker, while another said his remarks had gone \"way beyond what is acceptable\". Conservative MP Nadine Dorries said: \"When he loses support for what was a very partisan moment I think his position will become more and more in jeopardy.\" Crispin Blunt, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said Mr Bercow was going to have to deal with \"the consequences\" of his comments. He added that the Speaker, \"who\\'s meant to referee all of this, should keep himself above that\". What is a state visit? Former Culture Secretary John Whittingdale told Sky News: \"It was a performance, it was John Bercow playing to the gallery and I think it was damaging to the national interest. I think it is regrettable that he did it.\" Fellow Conservative Nadhim Zahawi, who has been critical of Mr Trump\\'s travel ban on nationals from seven mainly Muslim countries, said the Speaker prided himself on his neutrality and to become the story was \"a bad place to be\". He said Mr Bercow had opened himself up to accusations of hypocrisy after allowing other controversial leaders, like the Chinese president, to speak, and urged him to explain his thinking to MPs. Meanwhile, Joe Wilson, a Congressman for Mr Trump\\'s republican Party, told the BBC\\'s Newsnight programme Mr Bercow\\'s interjection had been \"very disappointing\". \"If ever in recent years there\\'s been a more pro-British president of the United States, it\\'s Donald Trump,\" he said. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Bercow had \"abused his position\" and that to have expressed his opinions in the way he did \"devalues this great office\". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has called for the state visit to be postponed, welcomed the intervention, while Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said Mr Trump was \"not welcome\". A petition to withdraw the invitation to the US president - and another one backing the visit - will be debated by MPs later this month. No date for Mr Trump\\'s visit has been announced.'],\n",

RAF fighter jets have been scrambled to divert a Pakistan International Airlines plane to Stansted Airport. Stansted said the flight from Lahore to Heathrow had landed in Essex at 14:50 GMT after being escorted by Typhoons. Essex Police said the diversion had been due to reports of a disruptive passenger and was \"not believed to be a hijack situation or terror matter\". In an unrelated matter, a passenger due to be arrested by police on arrival at Heathrow was held at Stansted instead. The Met said the 52-year-old had been arrested on suspicion of committing fraud offences in the UK and was being transferred to a London police station. The Airbus A330 was held away from the airport after its diversion and Pakistan International Airlines said passengers were provided with \"surface transport\" to London. Stansted remained open as usual throughout the incident. An Essex police spokesman said: \"An aircraft was diverted to Stansted Airport at around 3pm this afternoon while over UK airspace en route to Heathrow Airport due to reports of a disruptive passenger on board. \"The plane is currently at the airport and officers are making enquiries. There is no disruption to the ongoing operation of Stansted Airport.\" However, Pakistan International Airlines said in a statement that UK authorities had received \"some vague security threat through an anonymous phone call\" regarding the flight. Pakistan\\'s Civil Aviation Authority tweeted: \"#PIA flight bound for Heathrow from Lahore has been diverted to #Stansted due to reasons aboard the aircraft.\" The RAF confirmed that Quick Reaction Alert Typhoon aircraft had been scrambled from RAF Coningsby, in Lincolnshire.

The man accused of murdering children\\'s author Helen Bailey has told a court he \"never stopped loving\" her. Ian Stewart, 56, denies murdering his fiancee and dumping her body in order to inherit her money. Mr Stewart broke down in tears as he told jurors there was \"no way\" he was responsible for killing the Electra Brown writer. St Albans Crown Court heard he sent her texts while she was missing, begging her to return. Mr Stewart is accused of drugging and probably suffocating his bride-to-be as part of a plot to acquire her riches. He was repeatedly overcome by emotion as he recalled the early days of their relationship, saying: \"We totally clicked and worked together as a couple.\" The 51-year-old writer was last seen on 11 April and reported missing by Mr Stewart on 15 April. She was found beneath the garage, together with that of her dachshund Boris, on 15 July. Mr Stewart denied knowing she had died until her body was found in a cesspit, Simon Russell Flint, defending, asked him: \"Did you have any knowledge of her death until you heard her body had been found?\" \"No,\" he replied. When it was suggested he had killed his fiancee, he responded: \"No way\". The former software engineer said he first met Ms Bailey on a Facebook group for widowers and widows following the death of his wife in 2010. The pair started out comforting each other over their losses - Ms Bailey\\'s first husband drowned in 2011 - but eventually began a relationship. \"We totally clicked and worked together as a couple,\" he told the court. \"I had fallen in love with her quite quickly but she warned me once to never say the L word. But then I went to hug her and I said it and she replied instantly, \\'I love you too\\'. \"I never stopped loving her.\" The prosecution alleges Mr Stewart murdered Northumberland-born Ms Bailey for her money. She was worth more than ?3.3m at the time of her death, the court heard. They also allege he disposed of her phone. Mr Stewart, of Baldock Road, Royston, also denies preventing a lawful burial, fraud and three counts of perverting the course of justice. The trial continues.'],\n",
       " ['Education nominee Betsy DeVos wins Senate confirmation vote The US Senate has confirmed President Donald Trump\\'s controversial nominee for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, by the slenderest possible margin. The US Senate has confirmed President Donald Trump\\'s controversial nominee for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, by the slenderest possible margin. US Vice-President Mike Pence cast the tie-breaking vote to secure her cabinet role, splitting the chamber 50-50. It was the first time ever that a vice-president has interceded in such a way for a cabinet secretary. Mrs DeVos, a billionaire who has no experience with public schools, faced a rocky confirmation hearing last month. Moments after voting ended, she tweeted: \"I appreciate the Senate\\'s diligence & am honored to serve as @usedgov Secretary. \"Let\\'s improve options & outcomes for all US students.\" Senate Democrats staged a 24-hour debate into Tuesday to hold up her confirmation. They hoped their all-night speaking marathon would pressure more Republican senators to oppose the nomination, but their efforts were in vain. Mr Pence was also the first vice-president to cast a deciding vote in the Senate since 2008, when Dick Cheney voted on a tax adjustment plan. No Democrats voted in favour of Mrs DeVos. Two Republican senators stood by their plan to oppose her confirmation, leaving the Senate in a deadlock. In the end Donald Trump is going to get the team he wants. Betsy DeVos\\'s education secretary nomination looked a bit shaky for a while, but no Republican senator was willing to be the third \"no\" vote that would have sunk her. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\\'s ties to Russia made some conservatives uneasy, and prompted sharp questioning from Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, but the former oil magnate\\'s party closed ranks behind him. The only real question mark left is labour secretary nominee Andrew Puzdner, whose confirmation hearings have been postponed four times amid reports that he has not fully disentangled himself from his sprawling fast-food business empire. If he withdraws, however, it will be quietly, before a confrontation with Democrats heats up. Democrats always faced an uphill battle in bringing down any of Mr Trump\\'s cabinet nominees, given the mathematical reality of being in the Senate minority. Republicans were loath to deal an early, embarrassing setback to the new president, possibly earning his long-term enmity. The fight over Mrs DeVos and other nominees has engaged the Democratic base, however. Now the question is whether they will stay engaged in the months and years ahead - or if this initial surge of activism will recede over time. Critics say Mrs DeVos, who advocates for charter schools, is not qualified to run the Department of Education. She faced intense scrutiny before a Senate committee in January, when she made headlines for noting that a Wyoming school might need a gun to defend against grizzly bears. Labour unions, rights groups and teaching organisations have also spoken out against her nomination. Groups including the American Federation of Teachers and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights held protests against Mrs DeVos outside of Congress on Monday evening. The 59-year-old is a wealthy Republican Party donor and a former Michigan Republican Party chairwoman who has long campaigned for education reform in the state. Her husband Dick DeVos was a chief executive of the beauty and nutrition giant Amway and her brother is Erik Prince, the founder of the controversial private security company Blackwater. She is among several of Mr Trump\\'s cabinet picks whom Democrats have been trying to block from being approved. Democrats said in January they would target eight of Mr Trump\\'s nominees based on their lack of qualifications and policy positions. Before Mrs DeVos\\' approval, just six of Mr Trump\\'s cabinet picks had been confirmed, compared with former President Barack Obama\\'s 12 cabinet secretaries at this point in 2009 and 16 of George W Bush\\'s in 2001, according to the Washington Post. The slowed process is also partly due to the fact that some of Mr Trump\\'s picks have not completed a lengthy vetting process typically required of Cabinet candidates, which helps identify potential conflicts of interest. Hundreds of staff positions also remain vacant as the fate of 15 of Trump administration\\'s nominees hangs in the balance.'],\n",

The government has vowed to build more affordable houses and help people buy and rent, after admitting the current market is \"broken\". The new housing strategy for England includes giving councils powers to pressurise developers to start building on land they own. Ministers also pledged to make renting more \"family-friendly\" with longer tenancies offered. Labour called the measures announced \"feeble beyond belief\". The government says at least 250,000 new homes are needed each year to keep pace with demand and councils and developers need to \"get real\" to the scale of the challenge. Mr Javid set out the details of the housing White Paper in a statement to MPs, with measures including: So-called starter homes, championed by former Prime Minister David Cameron, will be aimed at \"households that need them most\", those with combined incomes of less than ?80,000, or ?90,000 in London. Starter homes are new homes built for first-time buyers between 23 and 40 years old and sold at least 20% below market value. The maximum price after the discount has been applied is ?250,000 outside London and ?450,000 in the capital. Under the new proposals, starter home buyers will need a mortgage, \"to stop cash buyers\", and some or all of the discount will have to be repaid if the property is resold within 15 years, \"to reduce the risk of speculation\". A proposal that 20% of all larger developments had to be starter homes is to be dropped and replaced with a \"clear expectation\" that at least 10% of developments will be \"affordable home ownership units\". The 22-year-olds who bought their own home (without mum and dad\\'s help) Ruby Willard, a recruitment consultant, and engineer Sam Bardell bought a ?182,200 two-bedroom terraced house in Havant, Hampshire, last year. They took advantage of the government\\'s Help to Buy Isa, but to save for the ?18,000 deposit, it was a case of being \"quite tight\", she says. \"When we decided we were going to buy, I thought I\\'m not going to spend money elsewhere when I don\\'t need to... \"I get commission and Sam gets overtime so we probably earn ?55,000 overall, which meant we were in a position we could borrow maybe more than people on minimum wage.\" Read how other 20-somethings managed to do it Mr Javid said: \"Walk down your local high street today and there\\'s one sight you\\'re almost certain to see: young people, faces pressed against the estate agent\\'s window, trying and failing to find a home they can afford. \"With prices continuing to skyrocket, if we don\\'t act now, a whole generation could be left behind. We need to do better, and that means tackling the failures at every point in the system. \"The housing market in this country is broken and the solution means building many more houses in the places that people want to live.\" Mr Javid admitted there was \"no one single magic bullet\" and there had to be a \"proper conversation about housing need\". Ministers have admitted the government is behind schedule in its efforts to build one million new homes in England by 2020. For Labour, shadow housing minister John Healey said: \"We hoped for better and we needed better. His disappointment will desperately disappoint millions of people struggling to cope with a housing crisis. It was feeble beyond belief.\" He added: \"We were promised a White Paper; we are presented with a white flag.\" The Lib Dems criticised the \"utterly vacuous\" proposals for not mentioning the government\\'s stated aim of a million new homes by 2020, a target ministers have insisted they are still aiming for. BBC home editor Mark Easton This government seems to speak with two voices on housing: the communities department wants to shift the balance of power firmly towards new development in places people want to live, but Number 10 and some influential Tory backbenchers are sympathetic to the passionate concerns of those who wish to protect the countryside and particularly the green belt. The real question that lies behind all the rhetoric and policy bullet-points is whether the balance of power between development and local opposition has fundamentally changed. Ministers now accept England needs 250,000 new homes every year, they have described the housing market as \"broken\" and they agree that radical change is the only way to mend it. But many have yet to be convinced that this White Paper amounts to a \"realistic plan\" to achieve that. Read more from Mark Former Conservative housing minister Grant Shapps told the BBC\\'s Daily Politics the problem would not be solved simply \"by slotting in a few more homes in converted former industrial sites\". He added: \"Housing ministers over the years have come out with documents or bills, and the truth is none of them are going to make much difference - and I don\\'t suppose this will make that much difference either. \"The reason is this - unless you build literally two, three, million more homes then you\\'re not going to solve the problem.\" The Local Government Association said the White Paper contained \"some encouraging signs\" on increasing housing supply and affordability. It welcomed the new \"flexibility\" around starter homes and called for new power and funding to allow councils to build affordable homes directly. The Campaign to Protect Rural England welcomed what it said was a focus on addressing current failings rather than \"meddling\" with the planning system. \"We are pleased that ministers have recognised that weakening the Green Belt is unnecessary,\" said chief executive Shaun Spiers. \"But with 360,000 houses already proposed for Green Belt land the government needs to do much more to uphold national policy and stop councils releasing it for development.\" Daniel Bentley, editorial director at the think tank Civitas, said: \"The problem is not sites with planning permission standing idle, except in limited circumstances. \"It is with sites that are being developed, but too slowly to get ahead of demand and make any difference to the affordability of housing.\" Graeme Brown, interim chief executive of the homelessness charity Shelter, said: \"The White Paper poses the right questions. What we need now is quick and bold action that helps people in need of a decent home tomorrow, not in 10 years.\" Where can I afford to live?

The mother of a backpacker who was stabbed to death in Australia has criticised the White House for labelling her death a \"terror attack\". Mia Ayliffe-Chung, 20, who was killed at a hostel in Queensland in August, did not die as a result of terrorism, police have said. Despite this, her death was included on a list of 78 alleged \"terror\" attacks released by the Trump administration. Rosie Ayliffe said Mia\\'s death must not be used to persecute innocent people. How the BBC covered Trump\\'s list of \\'under-reported\\' terror attacks The White House released the list of attacks to back up Mr Trump\\'s claim the media was \"under-reporting\" attacks committed or inspired by the Islamic State group. The list included the Bataclan theatre attack in Paris, the shootings in Sousse, Tunisia, which killed 30 British tourists, and Ms Ayliffe-Chung\\'s murder. The 20 year old, from Wirksworth, died from multiple stab wounds, during the attack at Home Hill, near Townsville. Australian police have ruled out the possibility her death - which was widely reported by media in the UK and abroad - was the result of a terror attack. Mr Trump\\'s comments come amid a legal bid by his administration to restore a travel ban on visitors and refugees from seven predominantly Muslim countries. In an open letter to the president, Mrs Ayliffe said: \"Treating immigrants as disposable commodities and disregarding their safety causes deaths throughout our so-called civilised world.\" French national Smail Ayad, 29, has been charged with the murder of Ms Ayliffe-Chung and that of Thomas Jackson, 30, from Cheshire, who was also stabbed and later died in hospital. Mrs Ayliffe added: \"The possibility of Mia and Tom\\'s deaths being consequent to an Islamic terror attack was discounted in the early stages of the police investigation. \"This vilification of whole nation states and their people based on religion is a terrifying reminder of the horror that can ensue when we allow ourselves to be led by ignorant people into darkness and hatred.\" Mr Trump has insisted \"the threat from radical Islamic terrorism is very real\" and has vowed to have the travel ban reinstated.'],\n",

The ex-husband of a woman who was awarded ?230,000 on her divorce has been told by the Court of Appeal he must support her for life. Maria Mills, 51, was originally awarded ?1,100 a month from 50-year-old Graham Mills after 13 years of marriage. Appeal Court judges also ruled he should pay her ?1,441 per month as she is \"unable to meet her basic needs\". Mr Mills had argued he should not have to \"pick up the tab\" 15 years after the couple split. Lord Justice Longmore and Sir Ernest Ryder heard the couple married in 1988, had a now-grown-up son, separated in 2001 and divorced in 2002. Mr Mills, a surveyor, had agreed to give Mrs Mills, a former Notting Hill estate agent, almost all their \"liquid capital\" when they divorced, while he kept his business. His barrister, Philip Cayford, told the court Mr Mills, who now lives in Guildford, had since remarried and wanted to \"move on\" with his life. The court heard Mrs Mills had made some \"unwise\" property investments, moving from a house in Weybridge to a flat in Wimbledon, and then to an apartment in a luxury Victorian mansion block in Battersea. After selling the Battersea flat she was left \"without any of the capital\", the court was told, and was now living in a rented home in Weybridge.

Tax is set to rise as a share of the UK\\'s income to its highest level since 1986, according to a think tank. Higher income from taxes and relatively low growth will combine to create this effect, according to the the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Austerity will continue into the 2020s, after Chancellor Philip Hammond\\'s decision to scrap a target of balancing the nation\\'s books, it said. The Treasury said it was committed to repairing Britain\\'s finances. Forecasts by Oxford Economics, which contributed to the report, estimate the UK economy will grow by 1.6% in 2017. In 2018, growth in gross domestic product will slow to 1.3%, Oxford Economics said. Growth is expected to be dulled as a result of inflation prompted by the decline of the value of the pound after the EU referendum. While a weaker pound is likely to improve the performance of manufacturers and exporters, higher costs for consumers will more than erase this gain, said the report. Ahmed: Public finances and the shadow of Osborne \"Though the UK economy has continued to achieve solid growth, it has been almost entirely reliant on the consumer,\" said Andrew Goodwin, lead UK Economist at Oxford Economics and co-author of part of the report. \"With spending power set to come under significant pressure from higher inflation and the welfare squeeze, the consumer will not be able to keep contributing more than its fair share. Exports should be a bright spot, but overall a slowdown in GDP growth appears likely.\" The UK\\'s economy could be 3% smaller by 2030 than if Britain had voted Remain, according to forecasts in the IFS\\'s annual Green Budget. This annual analysis, ahead of next month\\'s Budget, says spending on health, social care and benefits for sick or disabled people represents a particular risk to the public finances because it accounts for almost one third of government expenditure. The report confirms that the period between 2009 and 2014 saw the slowest rate of growth in health spending in England since the mid-1950s. And it argues that health budgets by the end of this decade will be over a billion pounds less than what is needed to cope with England\\'s growing and ageing population, regardless of what are likely to be significant rises in demand for NHS care. In a statement, the Treasury said: \"The government is committed to repairing the public finances and living within our means so that we can build an economy that works for all. \"That has required some difficult decisions on spending, but we are determined to deliver efficient public services which provide maximum value for every pound of taxpayers\\' money.\" Spending on public services dropped by 10% since 2010, the report said, after adjusting the figures for inflation. To meet his target of eliminating the deficit during the next parliament, which is from 2020 to 2025, Mr Hammond will probably have to find a further ?34bn in tax rises and spending cuts, extending austerity. The report said ?17bn of tax rises could be needed to contribute to closing the gap for government between outgoings and income.'],\n",

A man who admitted racially abusing a US army veteran on a Manchester tram with two other males has been jailed. Juan Jasso was verbally attacked and had beer thrown at him for tackling the trio for using foul language on the Metrolink tram on 28 June. Jobless Robert Molloy, 20, of no fixed address, was jailed for six months for abusing Mr Jasso and two other men. Sentencing of Aaron Cauchi, 19, was adjourned over illness while a boy, 16, was given a six-month referral order. The court heard the trio had been drinking all night when they went on a \"rampage\" and abused Mr Jasso and two other people in separate incidents. Their abuse of Mr Jasso was filmed by a passenger and widely viewed. Trouble began at 07:45 BST when a passenger heard \"disgusting, vile abuse\" on the tram packed with mothers with babies, schoolchildren and commuters, the court heard. Joseph O\\'Connor, prosecuting, told the court the trio then got off the tram and surrounded another man, \"with their chests stuck out and shoulders back, striking him with a cigarette lighter to intimidate him\". Shortly afterwards another man was cycling to work when he passed the trio and one or more spat at him, the court heard.

       " ['Strippers who blackmailed Danny Cipriani sentenced Two strippers who admitted blackmailing rugby player Danny Cipriani, after one of them aborted his child, have received suspended sentences. Two strippers who admitted blackmailing rugby player Danny Cipriani, after one of them aborted his child, have received suspended sentences. Lisa Murphy, 39, had a termination in the summer of 2015 after a relationship with Cipriani, 29, the court heard. But when she was forced to miss work, due to complications, she asked him for money, which he did not pay. Murphy enlisted her colleague, Violet Smith, 29, for help and they threatened to go to the papers with the story. Murphy from Wootton, Northampton, and Smith of Slough, Berkshire, were handed a 22-month sentence suspended for two years at Kingston Crown Court. The Wasps fly-half - who was playing for Sale Sharks at the time - had offered to pay for the abortion but Murphy refused, insisting she could have the procedure for free on the NHS, the court heard previously. But when she experienced a health scare following the procedure and was unable to work, she became \"increasingly frustrated, increasingly upset, and increasingly desperate\", her lawyer, Hannah Duncan, said. Judge Peter Lodder noted while Cipriani had \"repeatedly\" offered to help, he \"did not act according to his earlier promises\". He said: \"Certainly he does not appear to have fully appreciated the extent of your difficulties\". Judge Lodder said Murphy was \"feeling increasingly desperate and was continuing to suffer from the emotional consequences of her condition\". Nigel Mitchell, representing Smith, said the pair had been offered ?18,000 for their story by The Sun but intended to resolve the situation with the former England player and continued to message him between September and October 2015. He said: \"Ms Smith\\'s intention was to try and resolve matters. Like her co-defendant, not for a second did she consider her action and behaviour was amounting to a criminal offence.\" Judge Lodder added that Smith was \"motivated by concern\" for her friend. \"It is against that background that the threat to go to the newspapers was made,\" he told the court. Describing how both defendants had since lost their jobs, he commented: \"It is an understatement to say that nobody has come out of this episode well.\" '],\n",

But we finally got there.\" Bizarrely, the bosses of both sides said exactly the same thing to me when I interviewed them last week, moments after they\\'d announced a deal to resolve the worst of the Southern rail strikes. Mick Whelan from Aslef and Nick Brown from GTR (Southern\\'s parent company) looked shattered but pleased with their agreement. But was everyone cracking the champagne corks too soon? Aslef\\'s 1,000 or so drivers still need to vote on the deal and there are possible signs that they might just kick it out. I spoke to a couple of Southern\\'s train drivers over the weekend and they were not happy. One wrote this to me: \"GTR, \\'We will agree to carry on doing exactly what we want.\\' Aslef, \\'OK, we\\'ll agree to that then.\\'\" He went on: \"I\\'m very much of the opinion it will be a resounding \\'no\\' vote (when members vote). The feeling is the union has sold us out.\" Another driver also said that everyone he\\'d spoken to will vote no to the deal, again saying that they felt let down and that the company had got away with it. He even suggested that some of his colleagues might leave Aslef and join the RMT union instead. The RMT is still in dispute with Southern over the same issue and was vitriolic about the deal over the weekend. True, this is just the opinion of two drivers who\\'ve been chatting to their colleagues. But it suggests some anger at what they are being asked to sign up to. I understand that there is going to be a meeting in Brighton on Tuesday, where Aslef reps will try to sell the deal to members. It\\'s bound to be frosty. All of this doesn\\'t necessarily mean that Aslef\\'s drivers will vote against the agreement. When I interviewed Mick Whelan last week he told me: \"I\\'m not in the habit of making deals that my members don\\'t like.\" Then there are the London members who already use driver-only-operated trains and may not feel as strongly over this crunch issue. Plus, Aslef doesn\\'t pay members during industrial action, and the double whammy of losing strike-day pay plus overtime may be enough to cut their appetite for a fight. If the drivers do vote against the deal though, it\\'s hard to see where the next breakthrough in this dispute might come. If two weeks of \"incredibly intense\" negotiation at the TUC can\\'t solve it, what can? Presumably, Aslef would be forced to call more crippling strikes, which would also turn up the heat on the government to take over either part or all of this troublesome, complex behemoth of a franchise. I can tell you, ministers are not keen to seize control. Meanwhile, the RMT union, which represents the guards/conductors, has vowed to keep fighting. Their strikes don\\'t have the same impact as Aslef\\'s, with the last one only knocking out around 30% of services. But even that might change if their angry Aslef colleagues decide not to cross picket lines. Anyway, we should know all on 16 February when the ballot result comes back. The worst may not be over for beleaguered Southern passengers.'],\n",
       " ['Why the falling cost of light matters Back in the mid-1990s, an economist called William Nordhaus conducted a series of simple experiments with light. Back in the mid-1990s, an economist called William Nordhaus conducted a series of simple experiments with light. First, he used a prehistoric technology: he lit a wood fire. But Prof Nordhaus also had a piece of hi-tech equipment with him - a Minolta light meter. He burned 20lb (9kg) of wood, kept track of how long it burned for and carefully recorded the dim, flickering firelight with his meter. Next, he bought a Roman oil lamp, fitted it with a wick, and filled it with cold-pressed sesame oil. He lit the lamp and watched the oil burn down, again using the light meter to measure its soft, even glow. Bill Nordhaus\\'s open wood fire had burned for just three hours on 9kg of wood. But a mere eggcup of oil burned all day, and more brightly and controllably. Why did he do this? He wanted to understand the economic significance of the light bulb. But Prof Nordhaus also wanted to illuminate a difficult issue for economists: how to keep track of inflation, the changing cost of goods and services. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme\\'s sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast. To see why this is difficult, consider the price of travelling from - say - Lisbon in Portugal to Luanda in Angola. When that journey was first made, by Portuguese explorers, it would have been an epic expedition, possibly taking months. Later, by steam ship, it would have taken a few days; then, by plane, a few hours. An economic historian could start by tracking the price of passage on the ship, but once an air route has opened up, which price do you look at? Maybe you simply switch to the airline ticket price once more people start flying than sailing. But flying is a different service - faster, more convenient. If more travellers are willing to pay twice as much to fly, it hardly makes sense for inflation statistics to record that the cost of the journey has suddenly doubled. It was to raise this question over the way we measure inflation that Bill Nordhaus started fooling around with wood fires, oil lamps and light meters. He wanted to unbundle the cost of a single quality that humans have cared deeply about since time immemorial, using the state-of-the-art technology of different ages: illumination. Light is measured in lumens, or lumen-hours. A candle gives off 13 lumens while it burns. A typical modern light bulb is almost 100 times brighter than that. Imagine gathering and chopping wood 10 hours a day for six days. Those 60 hours of work would produce 1,000 lumen hours of light. That is the equivalent of one modern light bulb shining for just 54 minutes, although what you would actually get is many more hours of dim, flickering light instead. Of course, light is not the only reason to burn fires: they also help keep you warm, cook your food and scare off wild animals. If you just needed light and a wood fire was your only option, you might decide to wait until the Sun comes up. Thousands of years ago, better options came along - candles from Egypt and Crete, and oil lamps from Babylon. Their light was steadier and more controllable, but still prohibitively expensive. In a diary entry of May 1743, the president of Harvard University, the Reverend Edward Holyoake, noted that his household had spent two days making 78lb (35kg) of tallow candles. Six months later, he noted: \"Candles all gone.\" And those were the summer months. The iPhone at 10: How the smartphone became so smart The steel box that changed global trade The hidden strengths of unloved concrete How the barcode changed retailing Nor were these the clean-burning paraffin wax candles we use today. The wealthiest could afford beeswax, but most people - even the Harvard president - used tallow candles, stinking, smoking sticks of animal fat. Making them involved heating up animal fat and dipping and re-dipping wicks into the molten lard. It was pungent and time-consuming work. According to Prof Nordhaus\\'s research, if you set aside one whole week a year to spend 60 hours devoted exclusively to making candles - or earning the money to buy them - that would enable you to burn a single candle for just two hours and 20 minutes every evening. Things improved a little as the 18th and 19th Centuries unfolded. Candles were made of spermaceti - the milk-hued oily gloop harvested from dead sperm whales. American founding father Ben Franklin loved the strong, white light they gave off, and the way they \"may be held in the hand, even in hot weather, without softening\", and noted that they \"last much longer\". While the new candles were pleasing, they were also pricey. George Washington calculated that burning a single spermaceti candle for five hours a night all year would cost him ?8, or well over $1,000 (?820) in today\\'s money. A few decades later, gas lamps and kerosene lamps helped to lower costs. They also saved the sperm whale from extinction. But they, too, were basically an expensive hassle. They dripped, smelt and set fire to things. Then something changed. That something was the light bulb. By 1900, one of Thomas Edison\\'s carbon filament bulbs would provide you with 10 days of bright, continuous illumination, 100 times as bright as a candle, for the money you could earn with our 60-hour week of hard labour. By 1920, that same week of labour would pay for more than five months\\' continuous light from tungsten filament bulbs. By 1990, it was 10 years. A couple of years after that, thanks to compact fluorescent bulbs, it was more than five times longer. The labour that had once produced the equivalent of 54 minutes of quality light now produced 52 years. And modern LED lights continue to get cheaper and cheaper. Switch off a light bulb for an hour and you are saving illumination that would have cost our ancestors all week to create. It would have taken Benjamin Franklin\\'s contemporaries all afternoon. But someone in a rich industrial economy today could earn the money to buy that illumination in a fraction of a second. And of course our light bulbs are clean, safe and controllable - no flicker, pig fat stink or risk of fire. The light bulb has become an icon of innovation. It has transformed our society into one where we can work, read, sew or play whenever we want to, regardless of how dark the night has become. But the price of light alone tells a fascinating story: it has fallen by a factor of 500,000, far faster than official inflation statistics suggest. A thing that was once too precious to use is now too cheap to notice.

The government has described the housing market as broken, promised more affordable homes and said it would help people to buy and rent. The claim: The green belt is safe from an increase in development. Reality Check verdict: The rules for developing green belt previously said that it was allowed only in exceptional circumstances.

It is not clear whether the new rules will be more or less strict than just letting councils decide what counted as exceptional circumstances. The government has described the housing market as broken, promised more affordable homes and said it would help people to buy and rent. A big question in discussions of increasing the supply of homes is whether planning regulations will be changed to make it easier to build on green belt land. Green belts were introduced after World War Two to stop cities from sprawling and countryside being spoilt. About 13% of England is now covered. This covers scenic sites open to the public, such as the Chiltern Hills and North Downs, but it also covers a lot of land that has limited public access and may not be particularly beautiful. In the House of Commons, Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said: \"In 2015, we promised the British people that the green belt was safe in our hands and that is still the case.\" So what has changed? There has been little variation in the amount of green belt land since 1997, although data is not available for every year. The Housing White Paper says the current planning regulations allow building on the green belt only \"in exceptional circumstances\" but that there is no detail given of what would amount to exceptional circumstances. The government has now specified that before allowing development on green belt land, councils would need to rule out options including: The White Paper also says that councils allowing the boundaries of green belt land to be changed would have to make up for it by improving other bits of green belt. It also asks for suggestions of other things councils should take into account before doing so. Read more from Reality Check'],\n",
       " ['The Kylie Minogue vs Kylie Jenner trademark battle A trademark battle between Kylie Minogue and Kylie Jenner appears to have come to an end. A trademark battle between Kylie Minogue and Kylie Jenner appears to have come to an end. Jenner, who first shot to fame in the US reality TV show Keeping Up With the Kardashians, has been trying to trademark the name Kylie in the US. But she has been blocked by the veteran Australian pop star Minogue, best known for hits such as I Should Be So Lucky and Can\\'t Get You Out Of My Head. After a long and heated battle, the Kylies may have reached a settlement. According to papers filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), in April 2015 Jenner attempted to register the mark \"KYLIE\" in the US for \"advertising services\" and \"endorsement services\". In response, Minogue\\'s team filed their opposition in February 2016, citing possible confusion and \"damage\" to Minogue\\'s branding. They noted Minogue was an \"internationally renowned performing artist, humanitarian and breast cancer activist\" who already owns Kylie-related trademarks in the US in several industries, as well as the website www.kylie.com. Jenner, on the other hand, was dismissed as a \"secondary reality television personality\" who had drawn criticism for her \"photographic exhibitionism and controversial posts\" on social media. The case was suspended at least twice in 2016 for settlement negotiations. On 19 January Minogue\\'s team withdrew its opposition, which means Jenner\\'s application could proceed. This raises the possibility that they agreed to a settlement. The BBC approached both sides, but Jenner\\'s lawyers declined comment, and Minogue\\'s team did not respond. The USPTO does not comment on individual cases. But meanwhile Jenner appears to have conclusively lost another battle - to trademark her full name. In November 2015, Jenner\\'s lawyers separately tried to trademark the name \"KYLIE JENNER\" for a long list of clothing and accessories. But this was rejected in July last year. On 23 January, Jenner\\'s team appealed against this decision. Flight attendant shares story of saving trafficking victim Why do Germans hate this football club? How to own a home in the UK by the age of 25 Last year, Jenner launched a line of cosmetics called KYLIE. According to her latest appeal, she wants to eventually have \"KYLIE JENNER\" branded clothing as well as loungewear, swimwear, and underwear. Meanwhile, Minogue owns \"KYLIE\" and other similar trademarks in perfumes and toiletries, music and sound recordings, live entertainment, jewellery, dolls and toys, and printed matter such as magazines and books. So far, Minogue has released fragrances, furniture and clothes with her trademarks on them. She also had previously said in interviews she intends to one day produce a musical featuring her greatest hits, and owns the US trademark for \"Lucky: The Kylie Minogue Musical\". But it\\'s more than that. Since the 1980s, Kylie Minogue has never had to go by any other name but Kylie, and her team has argued it\\'s a fundamental part of the pop diva\\'s identity.

       " ['Do \\'longest flight\\' records matter? Qatar Airways has launched what it says is the longest current non-stop commercial route, after completing a journey from Doha to Auckland. Qatar Airways has launched what it says is the longest current non-stop commercial route, after completing a journey from Doha to Auckland. Flight QR920 landed on Monday after 16 hours and 23 minutes, slightly quicker than expected. The Boeing 777-200LR jet was showered with water cannons on arrival - a tradition for airlines on new routes. Carriers like to talk up these records, but how are they measured and do they really matter? Longest (time) or furthest (distance) are the two key distinctions to make, but it\\'s not as simple as it might sound. The distance between two cities doesn\\'t vary for airlines of course, but they might choose to take alternative routes. For example, a carrier might choose to avoid flying over certain countries which can alter how far a plane flies from point A to point B. And airlines have been known to take unconventional routes. In October last year, Air India flew Delhi to San Francisco by crossing the Pacific rather than the Atlantic - a direction switch which added an extra 1,400km to the journey, making the 15,127km trip the longest ever non-stop flight by distance. By comparison, Qatar\\'s new route is 14,535km. But regardless of the route, flight time is dependent on headwinds or tailwinds. For example, Qatar\\'s return leg from Auckland to Doha is expected to take about 18 hours because of headwinds. And though Air India went the \"long way round\", favourable tailwinds meant the journey took about two-and-a-half hours less than its conventional route. \"The longest flying time doesn\\'t always correspond with the longest distance,\" says Ellis Taylor of Flightglobal. \"Of course, from a passenger perspective, the flying time is probably the best measurement.\" Record-breaking flights may make headlines. But new long-haul flights mean nothing if they\\'re treated as a standalone route, says Mr Taylor. Rather, it\\'s what a new route brings to the airline\\'s existing network. \"On its own, it wouldn\\'t be viable to fly between Auckland and Doha, but Qatar is focusing on the passengers from Auckland going on to Europe, Africa, the US or elsewhere,\" says Mr Taylor. \"In that light, even though it may take some time for the route to stack up from a profit perspective, it may help the economics of its wider network.\" Historically, most of the major long-haul routes have been serviced by legacy airlines like Singapore Airlines and Australia\\'s Qantas. But adding new routes have allowed newer airlines like Qatar, and perhaps most notably Emirates, to expand their business very rapidly. \"It\\'s also about reach for Middle East airlines striving to outdo each other,\" says Geoffrey Thomas of Airlineratings.com. Longest flight records will continue to change hands as airlines launch new routes, and the range capability of aircraft improves. Last year, for example, Qantas revealed it would fly direct between Perth and London from March 2018, a flight that will take 17 hours. The price of fuel and the types of planes which airlines buy will be the determining factors in opening new routes \"With the arrival of the 777-8X in 2022, new records such as flights from Sydney to New York and Sydney to London will be set,\" says Mr Thomas. \"The 777-8X will be the ultimate long haul airliner.\" But remember, for routes to be viable, they also require people to buy tickets. That depends on passengers being willing to sit in their seats for 16, 17 or maybe 18 hours at a time. How long that desire will last (especially for travellers cramped up in economy) is something airlines will monitor carefully.'],\n",
       " ['Taking on Trump: Is the US facing a constitutional crisis? Donald Trump says he is defending the United States from terrorism - but a \"so-called judge\" is \"making the job very difficult\". Donald Trump says he is defending the United States from terrorism - but a \"so-called judge\" is \"making the job very difficult\". But the judge - in halting the president\\'s controversial executive order on immigration - said he was making sure President Trump\\'s actions follow the law. That sets two theoretically equal branches of the government against one another - and could bring about a crisis. The separation of powers is crucial to understanding how the US is governed. The country\\'s constitution established its treasured system of checks and balances - where the different branches of government hold equal authority and offset one another. The federal government\\'s power is split into three distinct parts - the executive branch, which includes the president and his cabinet; the legislative branch, Congress, which makes the laws; and the judiciary. This works well most of the time, with each branch co-operating with the next. But with the president in open conflict with another branch, there are fears that an impasse could be reached. That could lead to a constitutional crisis - a scenario in which the situation cannot be resolved - particularly after Mr Trump seemed to openly question the judge\\'s authority. \"The President\\'s hostility toward the rule of law is not just embarrassing, it is dangerous,\" Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, from the Senate judiciary committee, said. \"He seems intent on precipitating a constitutional crisis.\" There are about 700 federal district judges in the US - the type facing down the president\\'s order. Unlike state court judges, these men and women are part of the federal court system - along with the Supreme Court and the Courts of Appeals. Day to day, it\\'s the 94 District Courts which deal with interpretation of US laws, treaties, and public officials - powers devolved to them from the Supreme Court. The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made... But the courts do not offer opinions on government policy unless they are asked - they only interpret law when a case is brought before them. The other two branches of government make and enforce the laws, and the judicial branch interprets the laws when there is a dispute. That is the issue here - a presidential executive order has all the force of law, and is subject to the same checks. Those judicial powers have been used many times before. Barack Obama faced stumbling blocks in 2015 when he attempted to use an executive order to grant a reprieve to undocumented immigrants, and George W Bush faced similar battles over detainees in Guantanamo Bay. It is true that district judges are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Judge James Robart, for example - the \"so-called judge\" of Mr Trump\\'s Twitter criticism - was appointed by President George W Bush and confirmed in 2004. But Mr Trump can\\'t fire judges. That\\'s because the founding fathers of the United States created a system to protect the judiciary from interference. Only Congress can remove a federal judge from office through impeachment, which involves both the House and Senate. It is the same system used to remove a president. This \"article three\" protection is, in practical terms, very rigid. Only eight judges have been convicted in an impeachment trial in the entire history of the United States. The end result is that federal judges usually serve until they choose to retire - or until death. In effect, two of the country\\'s three branches of government are in conflict - and neither can remove the other. Inside the mind of Donald Trump Which executive actions will have the most impact? Tech world caught between Trump and a liberal place The Supreme Court, as the name implies, has ultimate power in the judiciary - the other courts are inferior to it. In this case, the government could have taken its appeal against the district rulings straight to the Supreme Court - and may still do so. Nine seats make up the court Four were appointed by Democrats: two by President Clinton, and two by President Obama Four were appointed by Republican Presidents: George W Bush, George Bush Snr, and Ronald Reagan One seat is vacant following the death of Antonin Scalia. Just as with the other federal courts, though, the Supreme Court is protected from interference. But there are currently only eight judges on the Supreme Court. Four were appointed by a Democrat, and four by a Republican - with one vacant seat waiting to be filled by Mr Trump\\'s nominee, which could swing the balance of power. Congress could break any deadlock that crops up between the president and the judiciary by creating a law that overturns his decision - or even impeaching a president or judge. Since Mr Trump\\'s Republican party holds a majority there, action against the president seems unlikely. And the independence of the courts is so essential to the US way of governing, that moving to attack judges on behalf of the president would be a drastic step. Nonetheless, with two of the three powers in conflict, the decision may fall to Congress eventually - unless Mr Trump modifies his order. That may be the most prudent move, in keeping with his predecessors who have often backed off in the face of judicial opposition. For now, though, Mr Trump \"just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril\" - and shows no signs of changing his mind.'],\n",

President Trump\\'s first week in office was widely regarded as a whirlwind. His second week has been no less hectic. Despite the mass protests of week one and falling approval ratings, the administration appears to be doubling down on its pledge to shake up the Washington playbook. In a divided America, many people are repelled by the agenda and tone of this administration, while many others are pleased that their president is taking a bold stand and getting things done. Here are five key things from week two in Trumpland. On Friday, a week after his inauguration, President Trump issued an executive order suspending all refugee admissions for 120 days, banning Syrian refugees indefinitely and suspending arrivals from seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days. The immediacy of the announcement, which Mr Trump said was necessary to not allow any lag time for \"bad dudes\" to sneak in, caused widespread confusion at airports around the world. Families were separated, and even Green Card holders from the affected countries were initially included in the ban. An Iraqi who put his life at risk as an interpreter for the US army was among hundreds of people detained at airports. Around the world, travellers were prevented from boarding planes, and in some cases, were pulled off flights. Vetted refugees waiting to travel to the US despaired. An Iran-born BBC reporter with British citizenship was among those temporarily detained. Demonstrators flocked to airports in protest, with many lawyers offering their services for free and filing emergency motions to have people released. Mr Trump said the restrictions were required so new security measures could be put in place to protect America from possible terrorist attacks. Things were working out \"very nicely\", he said. Steve Gruber, a popular talk-show host in Michigan, summed up the mood among many Trump voters. Listeners, he said, \"are encouraged that a politician, albeit a new one, is actually doing the things he said he would do\". Several courts moved to block parts of the order being implemented, but reports said that border officers in some places were not complying with the rulings. As condemnation grew, including from a few top Republicans, many foreign governments and major US companies, the White House insisted it was not a Muslim ban, pointing to the many Muslim-majority countries not involved. Thousands join protests across UK But former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani undermined that claim, admitting to Fox News that Mr Trump had previously asked him how to legally implement a ban on Muslims. He said, however, that the ban implemented was based on \"danger\", not religion. Sean Spicer, the White House\\'s combative press secretary, blasted journalists for reporting it as a travel \"ban\", even though his boss used that very wording on Twitter. Meanwhile, the world tried to figure out the unique language on display at protests in Scotland. The immigration order\\'s fallout dominated headlines for most of this week. \"This has proven to be an embarrassing episode in what looks like a not-ready-for-primetime White House,\" our correspondent Anthony Zurcher wrote. Amateur hour at the White House? But President Trump\\'s supporters think he\\'s doing a great job. The former reality TV star now in the White House was this week finally given a chance to fire someone. In the middle of the furore over the immigration ban, acting attorney general Sally Yates ordered justice department lawyers not to enforce President Trump\\'s executive order. Within hours, she was dismissed and accused by President Trump of \"betraying\" her department and being \"weak on borders\". Some observers and journalists asked whether the dismissal would have a chilling effect across government. But the White House said justice department lawyers had deemed the order legal and thus Ms Yates was not fulfilling her duty. The move came on the heels of other comments from the administration suggesting that dissent from officials would not be tolerated. As news spread on Monday that hundreds of US diplomats around the world were planning to use a \"dissent channel\" to argue that the immigration restrictions would not make the US safer, Sean Spicer said \"they should either get with the programme or they can go\". That seemed like a pretty direct message to US government employees with independent views. On Tuesday evening at a White House ceremony, Donald Trump unveiled his pick to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court - Judge Neil Gorsuch, of Colorado. The Democrats, whom the administration has chastised for seeking to stymie them at every opportunity, have hinted they will use all means at their disposal to block his confirmation in the Senate. The Supreme Court has the final say on such divisive issues such as abortion, gun control and gay rights. Since Judge Antonin Scalia died a year ago, the court has been split equally between liberal and conservative justices, at four each. Whoever holds the ninth seat is thus pretty significant, though justices don\\'t always split on clear ideological lines. Barack Obama tried to replace Mr Scalia with a nominee of his choice, but the Republicans didn\\'t allow it given an election was forthcoming. Like the late Mr Scalia, the Ivy-League educated Mr Gorsuch is known to support textualism, or the interpretation of law according to its plain text. He also maintains a strict interpretation of the US Constitution, or how it was originally understood by the Founding Fathers. Who is Neil Gorsuch? Why is the US Supreme Court so important? House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi called the nominee \"a very hostile appointment\" and \"a very bad decision, well outside the mainstream of American legal thought\". And of course, there were more protests. Stephen Bannon, Donald Trump\\'s chief strategist, is a man who many people believe is behind much of what has come out of the White House in the past two weeks. The former executive chairman of populist, conservative news website Breitbart has been described as a \"rumpled right-wing agitator\" by the New York Times. On Saturday night, he was given a seat on the National Security Council\\'s inner circle, or principals\\' committee. Under the restructuring, the Joint Chiefs and director of national intelligence have been told only to attend when discussions pertain to their areas. The move shocked many Washington veterans. \"It\\'s completely unprecedented to have a political adviser as a member of that group,\" Eliot Cohen, director of the Strategic Studies Program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, told the BBC. Mr Bannon has a \"destructive\" world view and has accumulated an \"unhealthy\" level of power, he said, describing it as an \"ominous\" move. What exactly is his destructive world view? Well, according to the Daily Beast, in 2013 Bannon said he wanted \"to bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today\\'s establishment\". The White House tried to brush the changes off, pointing to the fact that Obama adviser David Axelrod had been included in some council meetings. Mr Bannon jokingly referred to himself as \"Darth Vader\" in a recent interview where he described US media as \"the opposition party\". Steve Bannon will now sit at a table where issues pertaining to US national security, and thus global stability, are discussed at a very, very senior level. Refugees are very much on President Trump\\'s radar at the moment and it is well known that he likes to talk about deals. But a phone call on the subject on Saturday between the US president and the Australian PM, which was scheduled to last for an hour, was cut short from the White House after just 25 minutes. President Trump said the conversation with Malcolm Turnbull, in which they discussed a refugee resettlement deal between the two nations, was not a favourite among calls he had taken with world leaders. In fact, the Washington Post reported that Mr Trump described the conversation as \"the worst by far\". He appeared to be somewhat irritated by the subject matter - a deal struck with the Obama administration which would see up to 1,250 asylum seekers to Australia resettled in the US. What next? President Trump was so worked up after discussing \"the worst deal ever\" that he decided to issue a statement in his preferred manner - via Twitter. Mr Trump tweeted that he would \"study this dumb deal\". Later, Mr Spicer gave an official version of his boss\\'s 25-minute call with Mr Turnbull. He said that both leaders had \"emphasised the enduring strength and closeness of the US-Australia relationship\". Mr Turnbull later thanked President Trump for agreeing to uphold the deal. Trump\\'s first week: Well, that was intense'],\n",
       " ['Should you have two bins in your bathroom? Our bathrooms are filled with shampoo bottles, toilet rolls and cleaning products which could easily be put into our recycling bins when finished with. Our bathrooms are filled with shampoo bottles, toilet rolls and cleaning products which could easily be put into our recycling bins when finished with. Yet research shows our green intentions are washed away as soon as we step near a toilet. Now a business group has come up with an idea for how to combat this problem - two bathroom bins. The Circular Economy Taskforce, who were brought together by Prince Charles\\'s Business in the Community environment charity, says it could boost recycling. So should two bins really sit alongside your stack of loo roll in the bathroom? Why should people have two bins in their bathrooms? \"It\\'s trying to address the problem that people are less likely to recycle packaging for things we use in our bathrooms than for things we use in other rooms of the house,\" says Jonny Hazell, senior policy adviser for environmental think tank Green Alliance. The Recycle Now campaign points to its statistics, which show that while 90% of packaging is recycled in our kitchens, only 50% is being recycled in the bathroom. \"Often homes have one central recycling bin located in the kitchen, so when in the shower or washing your face it can be tricky to remember to transfer it to that bin,\" it says. \"This is why having a recycling bin or bag in the bathroom might be useful, if there is space.\" Business in the Community says two bins could make it easier to separate out the plastics that can be recycled. \"But it doesn\\'t have to be a bin, it could be as simple as a bag on the door handle that you bring down to the kitchen every week,\" it added. Where has this idea come from? While recycling has grown from 12% to 45% in the UK over the last decade, campaigners say the bathroom is an area that needs more focus. The Circular Economy Taskforce came up with the idea as part of its work looking at practical collaborative ways to boost recycling and re-use rates. \"The bathroom is one of the areas that has come up time and time again in the group as somewhere where both business and consumers can make a difference to help us all reduce our impact on the environment,\" says Business in the Community. \"Thinking about how different types of bins could boost recycling in the bathroom is just one example of a potential simple solution that could have a big impact.\" Why are people failing to recycle their bathroom products? Campaigners believes it comes down not just to where a recycling bin is located but also to confusion over what can be recycled. Recycle Now says: \"There can also be confusion about what can or can\\'t be recycled with bathroom products. \"For example many people don\\'t realise that bleach bottles can be easily recycled - simply make sure it\\'s empty and put the lid back on. \"Recycling just one bleach bottle saves enough energy to power a street light for 6.5 hours, so the value quickly adds up.\" Research from the University of Exeter also found that people who threw away waste in the bathroom saw it as being \"dirty\" and were less likely to recycle it. Going through your bathroom bin to separate out what can and can\\'t be recycled can seem off-putting,\" says Business in the Community. It added: \"There is also a lot of confusion around what can be recycled in the bathroom, for example many consumers are confused by aerosols.\" How much recyclable waste comes from a bathroom? A surprising amount. Typical products include: Plastic shampoo, conditioner and shower gel bottles, plastic moisturiser bottles (such as for hand cream and body lotion), glass face cream pots (plus the cardboard packaging they come in), perfume and aftershave bottles, aerosols for deodorant, air freshener and shaving foam, bleach and bathroom cleaner bottles, toothpaste boxes and toilet roll tubes. Is a lack of recycling in bathrooms a real problem? Every little helps, is the message from environmental and recycling groups. \"In general, the less we recycle, the more water and energy we need to use to produce the materials we use in our daily lives,\" said Mr Hazell. Recycle Now says recycling reduces the amount we are sending to landfill and makes use of resources already available rather than making them from scratch. \"Ultimately this means reduced levels of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere which contribute to climate change,\" it added. \"For instance it takes 75% less energy to make a plastic shampoo bottle from recycled plastic compared with using virgin materials.\" Can two bins have a meaningful impact on recycling overall? \"Ensuring you recycle in the bathroom can make a big difference,\" says Recycle Now. \"It would save ?135,000 in landfill costs if every UK household threw their next empty shampoo bottles into the recycling bin. \"On top of this, if everyone recycled one more toilet roll tube it would save enough cardboard inner tubes from landfill to go round the M25 38 times.\" But what if you don\\'t have the space for two bins? There are other options. Hang a reusable bag on the bathroom door so you can transfer your recyclable items straight into the recycling bin. Or opt for a bin with split compartments which can be used to separate recyclable and non-recyclable items.'],\n",
       " ['Vegetable shortage: How to cope as supermarkets ration lettuces Some supermarkets are rationing iceberg lettuces, with experts warning it could be the, er, tip of the iceberg. Some supermarkets are rationing iceberg lettuces, with experts warning it could be the, er, tip of the iceberg. Bad weather in Europe has already caused a #courgette crisis, alongside a shortage of broccoli, tomatoes, salad peppers and aubergines. With vegetable shortages expected to continue until April, what alternatives are there for shoppers? During the UK\\'s winter months of December, January and February, UK farmers produce beetroot, Brussel sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, celeriac, chicory, fennel, Jerusalem artichokes, kale, leeks, parsnips, potatoes, red cabbage, swede and turnips. We\\'ve become a \"slightly strange group\", expecting all-year-round produce, according to Lord Haskins, the former chairman of Northern Foods, which supplies Tesco. \"Thirty years ago you\\'d never have worried about buying lettuce in the middle of the winter - lettuces were things that grew in the summer and you ate them in the summer - you ate cauliflowers and Brussels sprouts in the winter,\" he says. As for courgettes, they are actually \"very, very out of season\", says organic vegetable retailer Riverford. We have just got used to supermarkets supplying them all year round. Eating British produce that\\'s in season is often cheaper, as it is produced locally - and it can be healthier too. According to food industry campaign group Love British Food, fruit and vegetables that are in season contain the nutrients, minerals and trace elements that our bodies need at particular times of year. Apples, for example, are packed with vitamin C to boost our resistance to winter colds. The group\\'s Alexia Robinson recommends beetroot, kale, cabbages, broccoli and traditional root vegetables for their health-giving properties. Riverford says a slaw made with cabbage, beetroot or swede will offer \"10 times more nutrients\" than an iceberg lettuce - which it says aren\\'t known for their nutritional value. If you are really keen on iceberg lettuces, you can probably pay a bit more for one from Peru or South Africa, says Lord Haskins. But imported vegetables can clock up a lot of air miles before they land on your plate - making them worse for the environment. Hatty Richards, from the Community Farm in Chew Magna, Somerset, says buying local is better. \"We have such a range on our doorsteps already, it\\'s fresher, it\\'s really good for the environment - it reduces air miles - and it supports local business which is crucial.\" Lord Haskins agrees, and suggests your tastebuds may also be grateful: \"We all buy stuff from far parts. They don\\'t taste nearly as good: strawberries at this time of year from Egypt don\\'t taste anything like as good as a British strawberry in May, June, July.\" A leafy salad is nice - but there are plenty of alternative dishes to try. Riverford\\'s Guy Watson thinks the UK\\'s more bitter winter salad leaves and root vegetables can provide \"a far superior substitute\" which will easily make up for a lack of lettuce. Vibrant winter coleslaws and cauliflower salads \"bring British veg to life\", he says, adding that one of the Riverford Field Kitchen\\'s most popular winter dishes is a kale caesar salad. Kale, which was originally used to feed cows, is a robust, hardy winder leaf that can withstand frosty weather. It can also be used in soups, stews, stir fries, gratins or just wilted with butter. For Ms Robinson suggests embracing winter comfort food with a \"good old fashioned winter stew with plenty of root vegetables with tender meat\". If you\\'re still not convinced you can do without leafy salads, try growing your own. Those who do want to eat lettuce need not despair. According to the campaign group Eat Seasonably, lettuce, rocket and other crunchy salad leaves are some of the easiest things to grow at home, all year around - on a seed tray indoors, on your window sill or in the garden. Ms Robinson says: \"As well as the cress there are many great veg that can be easily grown in window boxes such as leaf lettuce, radishes, spinach, green onions and of course a good selection of herbs.\" Another easy win is beetroot, Eat Seasonably says, which can be grown in a big pot. Though beetroot is harvested in October, Riverford says it can last up to four months if it\\'s kept in a cold storage. \"Carrots are not too hard to grow either,\" Riverford\\'s Emily Muddeman said, \"Leeks, kale - you could plant just four or five stalks of kale and it will go on sprouting.\" Any budding gardeners could start with planting onions later this month - Eat Seasonably says they are \"not even slightly difficult to grow\".'],\n",

The 32-year-old opening batsman led England a record 59 times in Tests. \"I hope I can help the next captain with whatever he needs and drive England forward,\" Cook told BBC Sport. \"I can\\'t see, for me, it being an issue being led by someone else. I hope I can be part of it and I\\'m really looking forward to the next stage.\" Cook took over the England captaincy in 2012 and oversaw series victories in India and South Africa, as well as Ashes victories in 2013 and 2015. However his tenure also saw a 5-0 Ashes whitewash in Australia in 2013-14, as well as a 4-0 series defeat in India last year. He is England\\'s top run scorer in Test cricket with 11,057 runs and 30 centuries. \"It\\'s a job you need to do at 100% and be committed to everything and I had to be really honest with myself,\" Cook added. \"I couldn\\'t do that anymore. It\\'s not a job you can do at 95%. I\\'m sad to walk away but it\\'s the right time to do it.\" Cook\\'s last game in charge saw England slip to an innings-and-75-run defeat against India, the culmination of a run of six defeats in their past eight Tests. The Essex batsman, who was left visibly upset by the final day\\'s collapse, said after the game that he would consider his future as captain. \"That was kind of maybe the final nail in the coffin. When I left India, I was pretty sure I wouldn\\'t captain England again,\" Cook said. \"Admitting that isn\\'t the easiest thing to do, certainly not with my character, but it\\'s the right decision for me and the right decision for the team. \"It\\'s such an honour to be England captain and all the bits that go with it. Everything I have been involved with, 59 games as captain, I\\'ve absolutely loved. Giving that away was very hard.\" Vice-captain Joe Root is the favourite to take over the Test captaincy, having led Yorkshire several times in the County Championship. The 26-year-old, who represents England across all three formats, has scored 4,594 runs at an average of 52.80 since making his debut in 2012. England face Test series in the summer against South Africa and the West Indies, before travelling to Australia in November for the Ashes. \"The one thing I learnt throughout my career as captain is that you need those people outside, looking in, to help you,\" Cook said. \"My first couple of years I was pretty stubborn that this is the way I should do it, and I didn\\'t take that much advice outside of England. \"Actually there\\'s a lot of very good people who watch a lot of cricket, probably more than all of the guys who are playing, who can offer advice. Finding people you trust that way is vitally important and they can help you.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Cook has a win percentage of 40.67 as captain, the fourth best of the six captains to have led England in more than 40 Tests. As captain he managed the return - and subsequent ending - of batsman Kevin Pietersen\\'s international career in 2014, a year which saw England lose a Test series against Sri Lanka from the penultimate delivery in Headingley and collapse to a 95-run defeat by India at Lord\\'s. Cook described himself as being \"pretty much at rock bottom\" following the Lord\\'s defeat, but he received a warm ovation from the crowd in Southampton during England\\'s next Test, where he made 95. \"When you\\'re really doubting yourself, to walk out there on that first day was really special for me. It was almost spine-tingling,\" he said. \"It surprised me, to have that warmth of reception. A lot of people walked up to me in the street, saying I was the right man to drive it forward.\" Cook added that he felt the decision to end Pietersen\\'s England career should have been handled better, and that he did not want the saga to define his captaincy. \"I was part of the decision-making process but I don\\'t have the power, or didn\\'t have the power, to decide who played for England. I was just asked my opinion about it,\" he said. \"However I felt at one time I was a bit of a lightning rod for it. That was a hard six months. \"I wouldn\\'t want my captaincy to be talked about just because of that. I don\\'t think it\\'s fair on myself or on the teams.\" Former England spinner Monty Panesar on BBC Radio 5 live Cook has plenty of years left in him and plenty of scoring to do, so I would like to say keep going, keep scoring the runs because he is a run machine. He is definitely one of the best captains England has ever produced. When the pressure is on, he has the ability to stay calm. He is probably the toughest cricketer England have ever produced and probably the most mentally tough. Former England seamer Matthew Hoggard I don\\'t think there will be any issues with Cook playing under a new captain. [Cook and Root] are good friends and they get on well. Without the burden of having to do all the press, the meetings, the thinking on the pitch, you might find Cook goes on and breaks many records with the bat.

The Italian had been under pressure after a run of just two wins in their last 15 Premier Leagues games. However, the Foxes said in a statement that \"the entire club is and will remain united behind its manager\". \"This is not a crisis,\" Ranieri said following the club\\'s backing. \"When you aren\\'t winning you lose confidence, it is normal.\" Leicester are 16th and are without a league win in 2017. Foxes goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel called the club\\'s title defence \"embarrassing\" after Sunday\\'s 3-0 defeat at home to Manchester United. Leicester acknowledged that \"recent form needs to improve\", but said Ranieri would be given the opportunity to turn things around. \"The unprecedented success achieved in recent seasons has been based firmly on stability, togetherness and determination to overcome the greatest of challenges,\" the club said. Ranieri guided Leicester to the Premier League title last season despite the Foxes being 5,000-1 shots. They won the league by 10 points but face becoming the first defending champions to be relegated since 1938, after winning just five league games so far this season. Recent reports suggested Ranieri had lost the support of his players, with the 65-year-old\\'s squad tinkering and supposed ban on chicken burgers angering some of the Leicester squad.

Whether after four years or eight, all US presidents must eventually confront the question: What happens when I leave the Oval Office? Whether after four years or eight, all US presidents must eventually confront the question: What happens when I leave the Oval Office? For Barack Obama, the answer was a five-star Caribbean holiday - and a seemingly endless grin. The former commander in chief has been pictured beaming on a beach in a backwards cap, flanked by an equally cheery Michelle. The venue for this masterclass in chilling? Necker island in the British Virgin Islands, owned by British billionaire Sir Richard Branson. Sir Richard posted pictures on his blog of Mr Obama learning to kite-surf, and engaging in a play-fight with the businessman. The airline mogul said he invited the Obamas \"for a complete break\" on his private island after they left the White House. Not every president wants a sunshine stay after the West Wing doors swing shut, however. So which leaders picked elephant hunting, marrying a relative, and a sideline in oil painting...? When the 43rd president left office in January 2009, he ditched Washington for a quiet life between a house in Dallas, Texas, and his 1,500-acre Prairie Chapel Ranch. Keen to enjoy his retirement, the sexagenarian took weekly painting lessons. His subjects included Russian President Vladimir Putin, Tony Blair, and the Dalai Lama - as well as his pets. His inspiration was his great hero Sir Winston Churchill, who turned to art in his forties as a refuge from the tumult of politics. George W Bush paintings go on display Obama asks: What shall I do now? Spotify\\'s job offer for Barack Obama \"When I get to heaven I mean to spend a considerable portion of my first million years in painting, and so get to the bottom of the subject,\" the wartime leader reportedly said. Mr Bush was less patient, telling his art teacher: \"There is a Rembrandt trapped in this body. And your job is to find it.\" Despite being nicknamed \\'Teddy\\' and famously refusing to shoot a bear, the 26th president took a year-long African hunting trip with his son, Kermit, in 1909. The duo were accompanied by more than 200 porters, and scientists from the Smithsonian Institution. They made their way round Africa dispatching over 11,000 animals - including elephants, rhinos, hippos, snakes, zebra, and monkeys among others - before shipping the carcasses home for scientific study. Another exotic trip followed for Mr Roosevelt (and Kermit) in late 1913, when they joined Brazil\\'s most famous explorer Candido Rondon to chart the course of the River of Doubt. The 760km (472 mile) stretch was ultimately renamed Roosevelt River in his honour. The aforementioned Teddy Roosevelt had no time for Benjamin Harrison, president from 1889-93, branding him \"a cold-blooded, narrow-minded, prejudiced, obstinate, timid old psalm-singing Indianapolis politician\". But none of that stopped the 23rd president from wedding a woman 25 years his junior, who also happened to be his niece by marriage. Mr Harrison\\'s first wife, Caroline, had died of tuberculosis in 1892. When he wed Mary Dimmick four years later, his two adult children refused to attend the ceremony. America\\'s first president lived only two years after leaving the job - and spent them making whiskey. In 1799, the year of his death, his distillery in Mount Vernon, Virginia, produced nearly 11,000 gallons - making it the largest in the US at the time. Also a livestock farmer, the founding father used leftovers from the whiskey-making to fatten his pigs. As for the distillery - it\\'s still going, selling its golden product to tourists at the Mount Vernon Estate and museum.'],\n",

Owning a home by the age of 25 has become an unachievable dream for many over the last two decades. Soaring property prices mean just one in five 25-year-olds own a property, compared to nearly half two decades ago, according to one recent study. But as the government unveils its Housing White Paper, there are some young people who have managed to buck the trend - without help from the bank of mum and dad. Here four young homeowners - all couples - who bought properties in 2016 - reveal just how they did it. Name: Mark Hepburn, age 23. A debt collector on ?18,500 a year Lives with: Partner Laura Starkie, age 25. An accountant on ?20,000 a year Location: Oldham, Greater Manchester House price: ?125,000 for a three bedroom semi-detached house Deposit: ?6,250 (5%) with the Help to Buy mortgage scheme (which ended in December) Why buy a property? We were sick of living at home with each of our parents and wanted our own space. I\\'d rather live in a house than just a bedroom. We discussed moving out and renting, but we both agreed it was dead money. How did you do it? There was a lot of budgeting. I literally know where every penny goes. I had to drill it into Laura a little bit, but she got used to it after a while. Like her make-up - she had to go for a cheaper brand. We were both working at McDonald\\'s when we were saving and if there were extra shifts, we would take them. Did you make any sacrifices? There was definitely a lifestyle change when we were saving. We would buy supermarket budget stuff instead of brands. We didn\\'t go on holiday during the time we were saving up - and that was a massive thing for Laura. How does it feel to be a home owner? I feel ridiculously happy. I feel proud and our friends are too because they know we worked extremely hard for it. Once you get there, you don\\'t need to worry as much. What if you need to move? I recently went for a job in Bolton, which is not that close to where we are now. The salary was ?27,000 per year, but I wouldn\\'t move house for that. It would have to be significantly higher to consider jobs away from where we are now. Reaction from friends? I can\\'t count how many times our friends have asked us how we\\'ve done it. We just explain you need to save, watch your money and cut back. They\\'re happy for us and we are just trying to get it into them not to leave it too long and to start saving. Should more young people be able to buy a home? I have got mixed opinions. When Laura and I were at McDonald\\'s we were on a combined salary of ?23,000 and we managed to save up ?7,000 between us within a year. So I don\\'t see how people can\\'t do it. But then we don\\'t have any kids. The Help to Buy mortgage scheme was a God-send. But if you\\'re stopping something that\\'s so good and helping young people, it\\'s going to cause mayhem.

An engineer on ?24,000 a year plus overtime Location: Havant, Hampshire House price: ?182,200 for a two-bedroom terraced house Deposit: ?18,220 (10%) with the Help to Buy Isa Why buy a property? It was a case of living at home. I moved back into the box room of my mum\\'s house and I hated it. Sam lived with his parents too so we thought if we can, let\\'s do it - so we decided to save and go for it. We were looking at renting but to us it was like throwing away money. How did you do it? Being quite tight is probably the answer. When we decided we were going to buy, I thought I\\'m not going to spend money elsewhere when I don\\'t need to. We did still have a nice holiday to Greece. I get commission and Sam gets overtime so we probably earn ?55,000 overall, which meant we were in a position we could borrow maybe more than people on minimum wage. Did you make any sacrifices? We may have not had such a big social life. We still did things, but we were conscious. What I did was save what I knew I needed to save, and lived on whatever I had left - which was usually about ?200 a month. I wasn\\'t buying lunch at work, which would save about ?25 a week. How does it feel to be a home owner? It was weird at first. When we got the keys it was like \"are we on holiday?\" When things started to come together it felt like such an achievement. Everything we had chosen not to do, not going to the cinema one night, helped towards it. What if you need to move? We would be open to the idea, but we would probably look for work closer to where we bought a house, so it probably would affect future decisions. If we did decide we wanted to go somewhere else, we would probably look to sell the house and hopefully we will have made some money on it. Reaction from friends? It\\'s been quite positive. I have got friends that have bought houses, but a lot of them have had big lump sums of money given to them. Should more young people be able to buy a home? Neither of us completed three years at university, so we probably established a career path earlier than those that do go. I speak to a lot of people that have graduated, and they cannot find jobs that will allow them to borrow enough. It takes years to save a deposit, and then house prices go up and they can\\'t borrow enough. I think this is how it is now. You might also like... Name: Andrew Douglas, age 23. A social worker on ?31,000 a year Lives with: Partner Kirsty Lamb, age 24. A pharmacist on ?35,000 a year Location: Moredun, Edinburgh. House price: ?145,000 for a two-storey terraced house with two bedrooms Deposit: ?21,750 (15%) with the Help to Buy Isa Why buy a property? We decided we wanted to get on the property ladder as quickly as possible. If we get on it now, we would be able to buy what we want by the time we are older and looking to have a family. How did you do it? We started saving at the beginning of 2015 and were probably saving between ?400 and ?500 a month each. We did go on a couple of holidays, so although we\\'ve been saving, we\\'ve still been living. We weren\\'t scrimping, but we do only spend about ?30 a week on food. We check receipts and look for the best deals, so that is more thrifty than most people. Did you make any sacrifices? We spoke about going away for three weeks to somewhere like Australia, but we thought - it\\'s going to cost ?2,000 each and we can put that towards the house now rather than waiting a few extra months. How does it feel to be a home owner? It feels strange. It does feel like quite a lot of responsibility - I didn\\'t realise how much. Things like taking out mortgage protection. Our friends call it \"adulting hard\". They\\'re renting and not really thinking about owning a place and they\\'re like \"wow, you\\'ve bought a house\". Reaction from friends? Lots of people think it\\'s really good, other people say they\\'re nowhere near that stage. I don\\'t know if they\\'re thinking I\\'m growing up too fast. It\\'s generally been positive. I don\\'t know anyone who has done it without a partner, so I think it would be difficult to do it on your own. What if you need to move? With a big move we might give it a trial, and rent out this house while we lived somewhere else. Should more young people be able to buy a home? I do think people complain they can\\'t afford to buy a house but they go out every weekend, they smoke or they eat out all the time. But property prices have also shot up in the last 20 years with more people buying second homes. There are also people who don\\'t want to have the responsibility. I think it\\'s good that the government is helping with Help to Buy schemes and it needs to do more to help first-time buyers. Name: Rebecca Thompson, aged 23. An information analyst on ?21,900 a year. Lives with: Adam Drinkwater, aged 25. A bank administrator on ?16,500 a year. Location: Irlam, Greater Manchester House price: ?126,500 for a three-bedroom semi-detached house Deposit: ?6,300 (5%) with the Help to Buy mortgage scheme and Isa Why buy a property? We lived in a rental flat together for 18 months and realised that the amount we were paying in rent was more or less the same as we would be paying with a mortgage. When we were renting there were a lot of things we couldn\\'t do, like decorate or move anything around. How did you do it? It was difficult. I was working part-time in my final year at university so I saved my entire wage and lived off my student loan, which wasn\\'t much. We didn\\'t go on holiday that year and saved as much as we could. Did you make any sacrifices? We came straight from university, where you\\'re living on a bit of a shoe-string anyway, so we probably sacrificed but not realised, because we\\'ve not been enjoying the extra income we\\'ve had since graduating. We would have probably gone on some more holidays or gone out more and probably bought a few more clothes. How does it feel to be a home owner? It\\'s brilliant. I feel it\\'s a really secure base while I\\'m going on to develop my career. It\\'s one less thing. A lot of people are aiming towards saving a deposit while I\\'ve got past it. What if you need to move? It would be really difficult, and it\\'s definitely an attraction for staying where I am. In my career there are a lot of opportunities down south, but I wouldn\\'t want to entertain it because of the house prices. It would take us five times longer to save up a deposit, and the amount of income you need to get for a mortgage is totally unobtainable for the average graduate. Reaction from friends? Some live in a more expensive area and I think they were surprised. It\\'s not something that\\'s on a lot of people\\'s radar, owning a home at this age. Particularly if you\\'re not in a relationship, I don\\'t think it is affordable. Should more young people be able to buy a home? I think cultures have changed a bit. When my parents were growing up, their parents drilled into them \\'sort yourself a house, get married and that\\'s when your life begins\\'. Now there\\'s not as much of an emphasis. I think homes do need to be more affordable. It\\'s silly that the town where we live in, a lot people can afford to buy - whereas only as far south as Birmingham no-one can afford to buy a house earning what we do.

       " ['The president and the bathrobe The US president\\'s spokesman has caused a bit of a Twitter storm by claiming Mr Trump does not own a bathrobe. The US president\\'s spokesman has caused a bit of a Twitter storm by claiming Mr Trump does not own a bathrobe. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer accused the New York Times of printing inaccuracies, specifically referring to him watching TV in his bathrobe, saying the paper owed President Trump an apology. The president has tweeted his annoyance at what he calls poor reporting: \"The failing @nytimes was forced to apologise to its subscribers for the poor reporting it did on my election win. Now they are worse!\" Unsurprisingly, people have taken to social media to contradict Mr Spicer\\'s bathrobe comment with various hashtags popping up, including #BathRobeGate. Some have even been delving into the presidential bathrobe archives to produce gems such as this from Avi Bueno. He tweeted a photo of Ronald Reagan in a robe, with the caption: \\'Weird to see @seanspicer and @realDonaldTrump getting all defensive about a #bathrobe when their hero wasn\\'t shy about it.\" And historian Michael Beschloss tweeted a picture of President Lyndon B Johnson sitting in a robe with advisers on Air Force One in 1966. John Aravosis, editor of @AMERICAblog, was quick to post three photos of Donald Trump wearing a bathrobe, which had featured in a November Daily Mail article about a trove of Trump memorabilia being found in a US thrift shop. Considering the Trump Organisation lists 37 properties, including 15 hotels, on its website, many posters are assuming that a bathrobe or two may have been worn in the Trump household. Various robes bearing the Trump brand have been posted on social media, including this picture of American actor Mike Rowe. He tweeted a photo in August 2016 of a bathrobe autographed by Mr Trump, along with a video in which Mike says he wore the robe \"briefly\". There were a few robe-wearing alternatives, such as Evie the Cat, the UK Cabinet Office feline who posted this about the 10 Downing Street cat, Larry. And with a clever bit of editing, some have posted gifs of the president holding up a drawing of a bathrobe. Even @TrumpBathrobe, a twitter account set up in 2015 and inactive since September 2016, has reawakened amidst this robing furore. Similar posts are appearing on Facebook under #bathrobegate, although not everyone is impressed: Compiled by Sherie Ryder, BBC UGC and Social News team.'],\n",
       " ['Trump says terror attacks \\'under-reported\\': Is that true? US President Donald Trump has accused the media of under-reporting terror attacks, and produced a list to back up his claim. Is he right? US President Donald Trump has accused the media of under-reporting terror attacks, and produced a list to back up his claim. Is he right? While on a visit to US Central Command, a wing of the Department of Defense, he warned of the danger posed by the Islamic State group. \"You have seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe it\\'s happening,\" he said. \"It\\'s gotten to a point where it\\'s not even being reported. And in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn\\'t want to report it. \"They have their reasons, and you understand that.\" Later in the day, the White House published a list of attacks \"executed or inspired\" by IS. Before the list was published, press secretary Sean Spicer said there were \"several instances\" of attacks that had not gained sufficient media coverage (without specifying which fell into that category). We have reproduced the list that was subsequently produced below, and explained what happened in each case and whether we reported on it. Just because the BBC covered an attack does not mean that incident was not under-reported, although it is unclear whether Mr Trump was referring to US or global news organisations. Some terrorist incidents do get more coverage than others, a point hotly debated on social media. Most of the atrocities listed by the White House were committed by Islamists, and the killing of nine black worshippers by a self-avowed white supremacist in South Carolina is notably absent. Absent too is the 2016 bombing of a shopping centre in Baghdad that killed some 300 people, and last week\\'s deadly assault on a mosque in Quebec City. What happened: A teenager was shot dead after he stabbed two police officers. He was a \"known terror suspect\" whose passport had been cancelled on security grounds. Did we cover it? Yes.

       " ['Oscars class photo: Seven things we spotted This year\\'s Oscars \"class photo\" has been released - and as usual there are several quirks and questionable outfits. This year\\'s Oscars \"class photo\" has been released - and as usual there are several quirks and questionable outfits. The picture sees 163 of this year\\'s nominees gathered together and smiling away, but zoom in and there is a whole lot more going on. Here are just seven of the things we spotted in this year\\'s photo. 1. Pharrell Williams didn\\'t exactly dress for the occasion All of this year\\'s male nominees are dressed smartly in tuxes and suits. Well, almost all. The \"dress code\" memo must have gone into Pharrell\\'s junk email inbox, because he turned up wearing a green baseball cap and grey sweater. To be fair - the sweater does have the Nasa logo on it, a reference to best picture nominee Hidden Figures. Pharrell wrote several songs for the soundtrack to the film, which tells the story of three African-American women who worked behind the scenes at the space agency in the 1960s. 2. Michelle Williams is upstaged by Casey Affleck\\'s facial hair Casey Affleck\\'s facial hair is fast becoming the eighth wonder of the world. It gets longer with every awards ceremony he appears at this season. It\\'s now on the verge of totally eclipsing poor Michelle Williams, Affleck\\'s co-star in Manchester by the Sea, who has to peep out from behind his mane. She must be used to Affleck stealing her limelight. The actor appears in nearly every scene in the 137-minute movie, while Williams\\'s screen time clocks in at 11 minutes. 3. The writer of Moonlight wants you to know how many nominations it has Tarell Alvin McCraney brightens up the back row of the photograph with his winning smile. He\\'s the man behind the stage play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue - which went on to become Moonlight, one of this year\\'s most hotly-tipped Oscars contenders. McCraney is so pleased with the film\\'s success he wants to let you know just how many Oscar nominations the film has received, and he is seen here holding up eight fingers. (There is, of course, another explanation. He could be making the \"305\" hand gesture - which is the area code for Miami-Dade county, his home and the place where Moonlight is set.) Also - hats off to Shawn Levy (who\\'s standing next to Tarell), who wins the award for the most delightfully bright smile of the whole photo. He is the producer of Arrival, which is nominated for best picture. 4. Justin Timberlake needs to sack his tailor \"What\\'s your inside leg measurement, Justin?\" \"I don\\'t know, maybe 32 inches?\" \"Hmmm, I don\\'t have enough material for that. Have a 28-inch pair of trousers instead.\" \"Great, that\\'ll do, thanks Derek.\" 5. The front row is so where we wanna be Emma Stone, Matt Damon, Natalie Portman, Octavia Spencer are all sitting together in the front row. Can someone please organise for us to join this BFF group, that\\'d be great, thanks. Extra respect for Octavia Spencer for wearing a pair of white trousers while so many of the other female nominees are in a dress or skirt, and for Natalie Portman, who manages to create the illusion she\\'s impressively wearing high heels even while pregnant with twins. (She is actually wearing her flat shoes and tipping her heels up. Crafty.) Also - Manchester by the Sea producer Kimberly Steward (far right) is that sweet kid in your class who was accidentally never looking at the camera in the school photo every single year. 6. Ryan Gosling needs to cheer up You\\'re the lead actor in the jointly most-nominated film of all time, pal. Uncross your arms for goodness sake. Slightly happier to be there is the lovely Dev Patel, in the row in front, looking every inch the Hollywood star. He\\'s come a long way from how he looked at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2009 when he was starring in Slumdog Millionaire. He told the BBC: \"I first came to Toronto in my school shoes and I had a blazer and I was with Frida [Pinto, his co-star] and they said \\'You can\\'t put this guy next to her because he looks so terrible\\'. I think I got a free penguin suit that didn\\'t quite fit me and they gave me shoes.\" This year, he\\'s nominated for best supporting actor and is seen wearing a burgundy Valentino suit. Nice. 7. Is this gap for Meryl Streep? Missing nominees from the photo include Michael Shannon (nominated for best supporting actor for Nocturnal Animals) and Andrew Garfield (best actor, Hacksaw Ridge). But of course, the most notable absentee is Her Royal Acting Highness, Meryl Streep - who is up for best actress this year for her role in Florence Foster Jenkins. Maybe this gap in the back row behind Denzel Washington was intended for her, and she got held up in traffic. Alternatively, perhaps she\\'s been to so many of these things she\\'s just had enough. Either way, we\\'re pretty sure she\\'ll be at the ceremony. This year\\'s Oscars, which will be hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, will take place in Hollywood, Los Angeles on 26 February.

And, like many IT managers, my users are never happy with the service they get. Like many parents, I am the unofficial IT manager in my house. And, like many IT managers, my users are never happy with the service they get. The complaints have got louder over the past few months as I have tried to manage how much time two of them (my teenage children) spend online and to restrict what they see. A patchwork of different technologies help me do this. It includes: It works, after a fashion, but I know it has holes and that is why I also use a lot of sneakernet. This involves me walking around the house, kicking my kids off the game console, tablet, phone or TV (delete as appropriate) they are using when they should be doing homework, cleaning out the rabbit or getting ready for school. Research suggests I\\'m not alone in using tech to oversee online time - both to limit it and to help them stay safe. About 44% of parents use apps to oversee online activity, 39% check browser histories and 37% put controls on the router, suggests statistics gathered by security company Symantec. I use all three of those and want to use more. And it looked like technology was going to get even more useful as electronics companies released products with comprehensive parental controls onboard. It\\'s perhaps no surprise that parents are keen to turn to technology to help manage time online, says Nick Shaw, European general manager at security company Norton, because it\\'s one area where they struggle to find help. \"When people have a parenting problem with their children, they might go to their own parents for advice,\" he says, \"but this is the one area where your parents are not as clued up as you are.\" And, he says, children are even more clued up and easily capable of running rings around their parents. \"A lot of parents are very naive about this,\" he says. Even I got complacent because none of the tech I had put in place was sending me alerts. I thought it was all working fine and my children were browsing and gaming in an impenetrable bubble of safety. Wrong. Slowly I found out that by fiddling with system clocks, using safe mode and putting home PCs into sleep states, my two teenagers could avoid most of the locks and blocks. My schoolboy error, says Mr Shaw, was to let the hardware do the heavy lifting. \"Technology is going to help you,\" he says, \"but it\\'s not going to get away from the fact that you should be having more conversations about this with your kids.\" What I should be doing, he says, is helping them to understand why the controls are needed. Explaining the reasons, he says, can help to defuse some of the objections. It is fair to say that my children and I have had some of these conversations. But they have been more of the \"play-less-games-and-do-more-maths\" type rather than the \"anti-virus-stops-your-YouTube-account-being-stolen\" sort. Tony Anscombe, security evangelist at anti-virus company Avast, says talking to children about safe ways to use the web is better than just imposing restrictions. \"Sure,\" he says, \"set some rules about how they should use it, but you should also educate your kids about basic security principles. \"A lot of parents just do not have the conversation, talking to them about what is acceptable and what is not.\" This should cover not sharing passwords and thinking before they share personal data such as contact information, images and videos. Naivety puts many children at risk, he says, and it is worth reminding them about what can be done with that information and who might want it. It might not just fall into the hands of cyber-thieves, he says, it might also expose them to cyber-bullying or just be inappropriate to share. Warnings about the hidden features in popular apps are worth passing on, he says, as they often seek to scoop up more information than they really need. \"The biggest and most important thing that parents can do is run the apps their children do,\" he says. This will help parents understand what information children might share and uncover any hidden features the apps possess. Some, he says, look innocuous but are designed to help children conceal what they are doing. \"Gadgets are only half the story, if that,\" says Dr Sonia Livingstone, from the London School of Economics, who studies how children use the internet, as part of her work with the long-running EU Kids Online project. Companies should concentrate on doing less selling and more on designing services that do not need the protections they peddle, she says. In addition, she says, parents should encourage children to do the right thing by doing it themselves, rather than just by dictating terms. It\\'s about respect too, she says, helping children make good decisions instead of arbitrarily imposing rules. If they can see the benefits of the rules, they are more likely to follow them. \"I am not very keen on the idea that parents have lots of control over their children,\" she says. \"Children have rights too.\"'],\n",

It must be a sickness!\" says Isabel Ettedgui, laughing. It is June 2016, in Mayfair in central London, and she is standing in the middle of a building site. An early 18th Century house is being renovated, ready to be the home of Mrs Ettedgui\\'s latest venture. She is attempting to relaunch a venerable luxury brand: Connolly, a name famous for its leather for over a century. \"I\\'ve known this brand for 30-odd years - I still really believe in it. It\\'s got massive amounts of potential,\" she says. Starting any kind of enterprise is challenging, with many businesses failing within their first few years, and relaunching one can be just as hard. \"Reviving a brand that\\'s been silent for a number of years is very difficult indeed,\" says consultant and author Peter York. So what\\'s the best way to go about it? Heritage is one factor that certainly seems to be on Mrs Ettedgui\\'s side. Look at the websites of many luxury names, and it is clear that history and tradition are some of the factors that brands are most keen to stress. These are attributes that Connolly has in abundance. The firm, which was family-run for much of its history, began producing leather in the late 19th Century. It soon won favour with a huge range of clients. Its leather could be found on the seats of many luxury car marques (including Rolls-Royce), at the Houses of Parliament, on ocean liners such as the Queen Mary, and on supersonic plane Concorde. \"You haven\\'t lived until you have sat your naked butt on Connolly leather,\" actress Joan Collins is reported to have said. In the 1920s, the company asked W Heath Robinson to produce some illustrations to mark its 50th anniversary. The artist, well-known for his drawings of outlandish devices, was astonished by what he found at the factory in Wimbledon. \"I can\\'t improve on that, Mr Connolly,\" was his response to one of the firm\\'s remarkable leather-measuring machines. Decades later, after doing some corporate identity work for the firm, Ms Ettedgui helped the enterprise with a move into retail. \"I just thought, \\'this is fantastic\"¦they don\\'t realise what they\\'ve got,\\'\" she remembers. The first store opened in 1995, in a mews close to the Lanesborough Hotel in London. Several years later, Mrs Ettedgui\\'s husband Joseph was offered the retail arm of the business, because the Connolly family had decided to concentrate on the motor trade. Joseph Ettedgui had extensive experience of fashion retailing, having built up the Joseph chain of high-end fashion stores, which had branches across the UK. He and Isabel nurtured the retail side of Connolly, opening a bigger store in Conduit Street in Mayfair. \"Joseph brought in clothes,\" Mrs Ettedgui recalls. \"It taught me that Connolly wasn\\'t just a brand of briefcases, it had potential to be a fashion brand as well.\" But in the 2000s, Connolly faltered. The family\\'s leather finishing business experienced an unsuccessful expansion into the US. And in 2010, Joseph Ettedgui died. \"After Joe died, I kept renewing these trademarks and thinking what am I going to do?\" says Mrs Ettedgui. She decided to put everything on hold. A few years later, she began to get the enterprise going once more. She licensed Jonathan Connolly (a fourth generation member of the family) to start producing leather again, while she began to look for a suitable retail location. Her search led her to a Georgian house just off London\\'s Savile Row. \"It was a little freehold building, which is really rare, and I decided to sell my flat, put everything I could into it and try and launch it without any external backers,\" she says. The house includes several floors of retail space, plus an apartment where Mrs Ettedgui now lives. For her, this is an essential part of the story. \"There\\'s a desperate need for a different narrative in luxury,\" she says. \"Too many brands are being run in silos by men in suits - what people actually like is to see the owner. \"It\\'s like when you go to a restaurant and the chef [appears] - it\\'s such a joy, you feel connected.\" As well as emphasising a personal touch, Mrs Ettedgui has broadened the range of items on sale. In addition to leather goods and clothes, there will be furniture too. \"Beautiful objects, beautiful clothes, well-designed pieces of furniture - it just goes together,\" she says. Reviving a brand, as Mrs Ettedgui is attempting to do, is a tricky thing to pull off. \"The things to think about are: how to explain what happened, because people are suspicious of a relaunch. [You need to] say very clearly what it is you\\'re about and reconcile that with the previous back story,\" says Mr York. Mrs Ettedgui is conscious of the challenges she faces - but she is cautiously optimistic. After a hectic period of building and renovation, and working around the clock to get everything ready, the store opened in late 2016. Soon afterwards, a customer came in and showed Mrs Ettedgui a Connolly wallet that he had bought 20 years ago. \"He was really happy that we were back,\" she says. To succeed, she believes, \"you need a dream - you need an obsession really. And you need to believe in something that means you can\\'t not do it.\"'],\n",
       " ['Germany\\'s most hated club RB Leipzig hit by stones and insults Football hooliganism is nothing new in Germany, but when violence broke out before a Bundesliga match between two of the top clubs, this was something different. Football hooliganism is nothing new in Germany, but when violence broke out before a Bundesliga match between two of the top clubs, this was something different. The stones and bottles thrown and the hate banners displayed by Borussia Dortmund supporters on Saturday exposed a widespread loathing in Germany for a team seen as upstarts, RB Leipzig. The club is challenging for Champions League football in its first ever season in the top flight. The hatred is because of the way they are wholly owned by one company, Red Bull. A wall of hatred was on view: \"Slaughter the bulls\", \"Red Bull, enemy of football\" were some of the milder slogans used. Families came under attack, and six fans and four police were hurt. One top football official Max Eberl said the violence was sick: \"Whether you like RB Leipzig or not, it shouldn\\'t get out of hand.\" Dortmund\\'s fans are not alone. One tabloid newspaper, the Berliner Kurier, even refused to print the club\\'s name a few weeks ago, using the insulting term \"Dosenverkauf\" (Can-sellers) in their Bundesliga table. Selling drinks is the core business of RB\\'s owner, Red Bull, and there have been plenty more insults since the company bought a team in the Leipzig suburbs in 2009 and oversaw four promotions in seven seasons. Listen to Tim\\'s BBC World Service programme here: The Rise of RB Leipzig The vitriol derives from RB\\'s ownership model. Traditionally German football clubs are run without a single, rich investor. It is the members who must control a majority of the shares in the entity that owns the team. But RB Leipzig has only 17 members. It follows the letter of this law, but not its spirit. Among the club\\'s biggest critics is the chief executive at Borussia Dortmund, Hans-Joachim Watzke. \"It\\'s a club built to push up the revenues for Red Bull and nothing else,\" he says. Read more on RB Leipzig here: RB Leipzig\\'s rapid rise \\'no fairytale\\' Andreas Bischof, whose blog in Leipzig pokes fun at the new club, goes further. \"This club is not owned or sponsored by a company, this club is like an outlet of a company,\" he says. \"It\\'s a whole new level of using sports as a marketing vehicle.\" But others argue that RB Leipzig is just what the city and surrounding region need. There has been little Bundesliga football in the former East Germany since unification in 1990. \"Football is a business that needs an enormous amount of money,\" says Martin Machowecz from weekly newspaper Die Zeit. \"And here\\'s someone who\\'s come along, got involved and made sure that we\\'ve now reached the same standard as in West Germany in an area of society that\\'s important.\" What RB as a club lacks in sporting history, its home city and its stadium provide. Lokomotive Leipzig became a household name when they beat Bordeaux in a penalty shoot-out to qualify for the final of the Uefa Cup Winners\\' Cup in 1987. The goalkeeper saved two penalties before stepping up to score the winner. Gerlinde Rohr, now director of the Leipzig Sports Museum, was among the reported 110,000 in the stadium that night. \"I was there with a school mate and after Rene Mueller scored his goal I jumped on the seat and we embraced each other,\" she remembers. The Zentralstadion fell into disuse after unification but was given a new lease of life by the 2006 World Cup. The oval embankment of the old stadium was retained and a new stadium built inside it. It\\'s now called the Red Bull Arena. Many see the appointment of Ralf Rangnick as the turning point for RBL, who had spent two frustrating seasons in the fourth tier before his arrival in 2012. As sports director and, for a brief period, trainer, he oversaw three promotions in four seasons. Ralf Rangnick\\'s key to success is youth. He likes to buy players who may never previously have had a professional contract and his squad is the youngest in the Bundesliga, with an average age of a little over 23. In his eyes, young players are hungrier for success and fit his playing philosophy. In Leipzig they place huge emphasis on pressing the other team high up the pitch and winning the ball in the opponent\\'s half. \"Even if you\\'re the best player in the world and you\\'re being attacked by three players, you lose the ball,\" he says. Ralf Rangnick also believes in the club\\'s controversial ownership model. \"What do you need members for? I\\'m more interested in the number of supporters we have,\" he says. As for suggestions that Red Bull\\'s owner Dietrich Mateschitz plays a big role in the way the club is run, the sports director says they meet and speak on the phone a handful of times every year. But what of the complaint that RB Leipzig is merely a vehicle for selling cans of energy drinks? \"For us it is completely unimportant,\" he says. \"It\\'s got nothing to do with what we do.\"'],\n",
       " ['NHS Health Check: How one GP practice tackled waiting times A GP practice in Plymouth has reduced the time it takes to get a routine appointment with a doctor from three-to-four weeks to under seven days. A GP practice in Plymouth has reduced the time it takes to get a routine appointment with a doctor from three-to-four weeks to under seven days. The Beacon Medical Group cares for more than 30,000 patients and was formed in 2014 after three practices merged. Dr Jonathan Cope, GP and managing partner at Plympton Health Centre, one of the Beacon practices which has 10 doctors, says, at present, there are 30 unfilled GP posts in Plymouth. Three years ago, his practice was unable to recruit the equivalent of one-and-a-half full-time GPs. \"We made a conscious decision to look elsewhere, to work differently. So we decided to looks at what skills clinical pharmacists, paramedic practitioners and nurse practitioners could offer. We converted that budget to two-and-a-half full-time equivalents.\" Patients registered at Plympton who feel they need same-day care from their family doctor call the reception team at the surgery. Depending on the problem, they will then be called back by an advanced paramedic, pharmacist, nurse practitioner - or a doctor. Dr Cope said: \"Because of the extra capacity, we have freed up the GPs\\' time. So we are offering more appointments for routine problems, and the waiting times are now shorter.\" The advanced paramedic practitioner, Simon Robinson, responds to any emergency medical problems in the practice, as well as doing, on average, four home visits a day. He says he is often called out to see the more complex cases and his daily schedule allows him to spend more time than the GPs with patients. Simon was keen to point out that if he does have any queries he just has to knock on the GPs\\' door. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said while paramedics are highly valued and trusted, they have different skills and training. \"GPs are highly trained to take into account the physical, psychological and social factor - this unique skill set cannot be replaced by another healthcare professional, however well meaning the intention is. \"We do not have enough GPs in the NHS - and actually we don\\'t have enough paramedics either. This transference of workload pressures from one area of the health service to another is not going to benefit our patients in the long term.\" In an effort to understand the pressures on the Beacon Medical Group, the 100 most frequent attendees were analysed. Dr Cope expected the list to be dominated by frail, elderly patients but instead the typical patient was a 37-year-old woman, often with mental health problems, multiple prescriptions and referrals to hospital. From March, a psychiatrist will do a weekly clinic from the surgery for these patients and provide additional training on mental health care to staff. It is part of a parallel drive to offer specialised new services more commonly found in a hospital setting. Dr Helen Frow, a GP with a special interest in dermatology, has provided care to patients registered to the group in the last two years. \"Onward referrals to the hospital have reduced by 85%,\" she said. A similar scheme for musculoskeletal care resulted in 75% fewer secondary care appointments. The model of working with between 30,000 to 50,000 patients in a multi-specialty community provider model is known as a Primary Care Home. There were 14 other sites working to this structure across England in the last year. The National Association of Primary Care is working closely with NHS England to explore how they can continue to expand working in this way. A BMA spokesperson said: \"Many GP practices are increasingly becoming hubs where nurses and other professionals work together to deliver services to patients. \"However, while this is encouraging, England is suffering from a drastic and worsening shortage of GPs that is damaging patient care and restricting the number of appointments on offer to the public. \"The government needs to address this workforce crisis urgently.\" A week of coverage by BBC News examining the state of the NHS across the UK as it comes under intense pressure during its busiest time of the year.'],\n",
       " ['NHS Health Check: Voices from the NHS frontline nan Andrew Foster is the chief executive of Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust. It is one of the best performing hospital trusts and up until a year ago it was meeting the four-hour A&E target. But that began to change in 2016. Instead of hitting the 95% target for patients to be seen and treated or admitted, performance dropped to 90% and then 85% in the autumn, before it nosedived following Christmas. Cubicles in A&E were full, we had ambulance staff queuing in the corridors and we could not get patients out of hospital \"It started from Boxing Day onwards,\" says Mr Foster. \"We had an outbreak of norovirus which closed three wards and led to 75 staff being off sick. Seven care homes had to shut too. \"It meant our performance dropped to around 60%. It was the worst three weeks I\\'ve ever known. Cubicles in A&E were full, we had ambulance staff queuing in the corridors and we could not get patients out of hospital. The whole system backed up.\" Since mid-January pressures have eased with four-hour performance back above 80%. But Mr Foster is still worried. \"The problem we have is that we are seeing more and more patients coming to A&E who could be seen by a GP and then we are finding it more difficult to discharge patients. There are simply not the places available any more because of the cuts to social care or we are seeing care homes and families themselves saying that the person\\'s care is too complex. They end up staying in hospital.\" Simon Walsh is a consultant in an A&E department in a major trauma centre in London. \"This year things have been closer to breaking point than I\\'ve ever known it before,\" he says. \"The set of nights I worked in the period before Christmas were the most difficult I remember working in the last 10 years. \"There was just such pressure on the system and as a result the exit block was so sustained that we had patients stuck for hours on end because there weren\\'t any beds available to admit them on to wards. We had in excess of 20 patients at times for the whole night. And it just paralyses the emergency department.\" I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever seen such tired, exhausted people - they were absolutely dead on their feet He says patients and their families were understanding, even though they were frustrated. \"The relatives expressed their frustration but it wasn\\'t anger directed at us - they recognised it was factors out of our control.\" But he says morale was low among staff. \"I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever seen such tired, exhausted people, they were absolutely dead on their feet. \"People try and keep each other up with as high morale as they can but I think people in that period were close to breaking point. \"I wondered if people would actually come back for the next shift after a couple of the nights we did.\" Kimberley Gardner is a nurse at a major trauma centre in the East Midlands working in the critical care department, while her partner is also a nurse in the emergency department. She says calling the situation in the NHS a humanitarian crisis, as the Red Cross did in January, \"is not hyperbole, it is the reality\". \"It is the worst I\\'ve ever known it. I saw a woman brought in by ambulance after vomiting from eating a tin of Quality Street \"During the coalition years we heard the term \\'black alert\\' being thrown around, but it would never actually happen, it seemed as likely as a major disaster or terrorist attack - devastating- but highly unlikely. Now it\\'s a weekly and sometimes daily occurrence and the novelty has worn off. \"Daily we get a phone call from an emergency department begging critical care for equipment to monitor patients as all of their resus bays have been \\'doubled up\\' (where they put two patients in one bay) meaning they need two monitors but only have one. They ask us but we have run out also.\" She says another issue is not enough trained paramedics or dispatchers for 111, the NHS non-emergency phoneline. \"The amount of people sent in by 111 to be on the safe side, it\\'s a total failure. \"I saw a woman brought in by ambulance after eating a tin of Quality Street and she was vomiting - why would she ring an ambulance but also why did the crew bring her in? Because a lot of the time they are technicians and not trained paramedics so bring them in to be on the safe side.\" Julie Orr is the head of clinical services for Milton Keynes University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. She oversees the flow of patients through the hospital managing the site team, bed managers and discharge team. People don\\'t have time to catch breath before the next onslaught.\" \"It\\'s been a challenge this winter. I think the main difference has been that it\\'s been sustained pressure. It\\'s been quite relentless rather than periods of a couple of weeks of pressure. \"I\\'ve been in the NHS for 30 years and this is probably one of the most sustained, relentlessly pressured winters that I\\'ve seen. \"People don\\'t really have time to catch their breath before the next onslaught of pressures.\" A former nursing manager, she says all her team are senior clinicians and move around the site ensuring the flow of patients through the hospital. \"We\\'ve had some very difficult days, which has meant that not only the site team but the managers on call and the executive on call have been on site for many, many hours into the night to make sure the patients are safe and that the staff are supported.\" But she says her teams have coped \"remarkably well\" despite the pressure. \"Obviously it\\'s very difficult. We all want to do the best for our patients and want to get them home wherever possible or on to the next stage of their journey - I think sometimes there\\'s not an understanding of why that can\\'t happen. My discharge team along with the ward nursing teams spend a lot of time with patients trying to explain why there might be a delay in that happening.\" Grainne Siggins is director of adult social care for the London Borough of Newham. \"Our staff and our staff within the NHS have worked incredibly hard this winter, it\\'s been really difficult. But in December working positively with our colleagues we didn\\'t have any delayed transfers (out of hospital) at all due to social care.\" She knows from speaking to her local peers within London they are an \"outlier\" to be in this situation. Because of the borough\\'s diverse population and high levels of deprivation and health issues they bring, the team has had to \"proactively plan\" - but she says \"it\\'s becoming increasingly difficult going forward\". It\\'s difficult to see how the system will be sustained She says they have been heavily supported by their clinical commissioning group. \"Councils are currently prioritising adults and children\\'s services above other areas of spending, but that will only go so far and we do feel we are at a tipping point and that\\'s been borne out this winter - it\\'s difficult to see how the whole system will be able to be sustained next year.\" And she says the ageing population means assessments are taking much longer. \"People have got much more complex needs, multiple long term conditions, so we\\'ve got that added level of complexity. \"We\\'ve seen a significant increase in the level of support we then have to provide to people to make sure they can go home safely and that they are appropriately supported.\" Dr Olivia Hum has been a GP since 2007. She works in a surgery in Lewes, east Sussex. \"The intensity of the work in 2017 is really bad. We work 10-12 hours a day without a break,\" she says. GPs are burning out, they are overworked She says the demand on GPs has increased \"because of the pressure on hospitals\". \"A&E is too crowded which means that people are not diagnosed properly and they come to the GP for the rest of their health problems. They then bounce back to the hospital. \"The local hospital has seen a huge decline in funding, so people are on six to nine-month waiting lists. This has a huge impact on GPs who are dealing with the deteriorating symptoms of people waiting for tests or treatment, including patients who have symptoms of cancer. This waiting also has huge personal impact on patients, it increases their worry and stress.\" She adds: \"There is a real crisis in GP staffing. Lots of practices are closing, so patients try to register at the practice next door which has no space. GPs are burning out, they are overworked and many are retiring early. The system is unsustainable now. \"It is just impossible to provide extra appointments in practices. I know GPs with almost twice as many patients as I have and they can only provide care at a very basic level. It is not safe - the brain can\\'t make these decisions properly in less than 10 minutes. In these cases, quality of care and patient safety is compromised.\" A week of coverage by BBC News examining the state of the NHS across the UK as it comes under intense pressure during its busiest time of the year.'],\n",

But Nikki has twice received a last-minute call telling her there is no bed space. She is still waiting. \"I\\'d prepared mentally - I planned my whole Christmas around the operation and recovery.

       " ['Reality Check: How much could NHS recover from foreign patients? NHS hospitals in England are to be forced to charge patients from overseas up front for non-emergency care if they are not entitled to free treatment. The claim: The NHS could recover between ?200m and ?500m annually from foreign patients if a system of charging them in advance for non-emergency care worked perfectly. Reality Check verdict: The NHS recovered ?289m in 2015-16 and ?500m is the government\\'s target for 2017-18. The NHS may struggle to meet that target, but it is not unreasonable to suggest that amount could be recouped by a perfect system. NHS hospitals in England are to be forced to charge patients from overseas up front for non-emergency care if they are not entitled to free treatment. Dr Mark Porter, from the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 5 live that the amount that could be recovered if the charging system worked perfectly was between ?200m and ?500m a year. He went on to say that was not very much money in the context of NHS spending and deficits, bearing in mind that the NHS budget in England was ?116.4bn in 2015-16. A report - based on 2013 figures - estimates that treating all visitors and migrants in England (not just in hospitals) costs the NHS about ?2bn, although it warns there is considerable uncertainty about that figure. That includes treating tourists who become ill while on holiday and longer-term migrants who have paid surcharges on their visas to be entitled to NHS care. Not all of that ?2bn could be recovered. Treatment in A&E, for example, is free for everyone up to the point when a patient is either admitted to hospital or given an outpatient appointment. The government does recoup some of the ?2bn, although not as much as it would like. It has a target to recoup ?500m of the cost of treating overseas visitors by 2017-18. It has made considerable progress towards that goal, increasing the amount recouped from ?97m in 2013-14 to ?289m in 2015-16. A big proportion of that increase, ?164m of it, has come from a health surcharge that must be paid by most students and temporary migrants from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) applying for visas to come to the UK for more than six months. Patients from inside the EEA with EHIC cards are generally treated free, with the government applying to their home countries to cover the cost. Those from elsewhere in the world who are not covered by the health surcharge will be charged for the cost of their treatment. Trusts are now allowed to charge 150% of the cost of treatment to patients from outside the EEA. The NHS has not been particularly good at recouping the costs in the past because trusts have not been good at identifying which patients should be charged for their treatment and it is difficult to collect money from patients living outside the EEA once they have returned home. The authorities have also not been particularly good at recouping the costs of treating people from EEA countries. This report from the National Audit Office said that on current trends the NHS would not manage to recover ?500m a year by 2017-18, although that was before the announcement of the change to the rules so that non-urgent care must be paid for upfront. The NAO estimated that trusts only manage to recover about half of the amount they invoiced overseas patients. The Department of Health estimated that in 2012-13 the potentially recoverable amount was ?367m, but it excluded from that figure the estimated cost of between ?100m and ?300m for a combination of people who had travelled to England purely to receive urgent treatment and regular visitors who are described as \"taking advantage\" of the system by registering for GP services and other NHS services to which they are not entitled. All of these figures are estimates. Looking at the bottom end of the range, ?200m is too low a figure as it is considerably less than is currently being collected. At the top end, ?500m is the government\\'s target - it is not unreasonable to suggest that amount could be collected by a perfect system. Find other Reality Checks here'],\n",

The number of Russians visiting the Republic of Cyprus in 2016 grew by 50% compared to the previous year, reaching a record high, Russian Ambassador to the Republic of Cyprus Stanislav Osadchy said in an interview with TASS. \"Last year was a year of records for the Cypriot tourism industry, which became possible largely due to a significant growth in the Russian tourist inflow,\" he said. \"According to the official data provided by the Cypriot statistics agency, the number of our fellow citizens visiting Cyprus neared 800,000, which is more than any previous annual numbers and almost 50% more compared to 2015.\"   The Russian diplomat also said that although the significant increase in the number of Russian tourists was a result of flights to Egypt being suspended, however, the trend for the growing Russian tourist inflow to Cyprus had remained for the past few years. Osadchy pointed out that Cypriots had been taking more and more interest in Russia due to increasing business cooperation, strengthening personal ties, religious and cultural closeness between the two peoples. \"More Cypriots have been visiting our country as tourists,\" he added. \"Even consular statistics prove that as around 6,000 visas were issued last year.\" \"I would like to emphasize that the Republic of Cyprus was recognized by the world community while the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) located in the northern part of the island is unrecognizes and is not controlled by Nicosia,\" the Russian diplomat said. \"In other words, if our fellow citizens find themselves in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus it means they are outside the legal system of the Republic of Cyprus.\" The ambassador pointed out that arrivals via the northern part of the island \"are viewed by the Cypriot authorities as illegal and are actually a criminal offence.\" \"This is why we strongly recommend our fellow citizens to arrive only through the airports and sea ports of the Republic of Cyprus,\" Osadchy said. \"Unfortunately, we often hear that some Russian nationals, either out of ignorance or on the off chance, attempt to cross the buffer zone so the Cypriot authorities arrest them.

Russia\\'s military hardware exports yielded about $15 billion for the state coffers in 2016, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Tuesday. The Russian premier cited these data at an enlarged session of the United Russia faction in the national parliament.   \"The state defense order has been actually 99% fulfilled and this has never happened before,\" Medvedev told members of the ruling United Russia party, which he heads. \"The export deliveries of military hardware as part of military and technical cooperation have brought about $15 billion, which allows us to keep our positions on the world armaments market,\" the premier said. Russia is placed 2nd on this market after the United States, Medvedev said. \"It is important for us to retain this market,\" the premier said. According to the premier, Russian defense enterprises have increased production by more than 10% Last year, Russia\\'s aircraft-making industry increased military production by almost 3.5% while its civilian output grew by about 20%,\" the premier said. \"Russia is developing principally new models of aircraft, such as the MC-21, which will fly using the promising PD-14 engine. Quite recently, the plane was rolled out in Irkutsk,\" Medvedev said, expressing the hope that the project would develop according to plan. Domestic ship-building has also demonstrated fairly good results, the premier said. \"Defense output in this sphere grew by more than 2% while the civilian segment of ship-building increased by 11%,\" Medvedev said. -Conditions should be created for export expansion of Russian industrial products to global markets, he went on.   \"Our industry should be competitive; goods manufactured by our industry should enjoy demand on the domestic and on the international markets. We must create all the conditions for the so-called export expansion,\" Medvedev said. Defense industry companies should also meet such criteria, particularly on account of making dual-purpose products, the Prime Minister said. The defense industry was often the source for technologies development in the non-defense sector, Medvedev said. \"The situation has reversed at present all over the world - the non-defense sector and its advance areas are very often pushing defense technologies forward,\" he added. There is also a need to implement innovations in the industry, Medvedev said. This will \"make possible to perform the quickest possible upgrade of branches currently lagging behind and create modern and high-technology jobs,\" he added. Medvedev considers it appropriate to maintain measures to support the non-oil-and-gas sector of the Russian economy.   \"I think this is right, I hope that the Minister meant this (Industry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov - TASS) - to maintain the set of measures of support that we approved in order to strengthen the non-oil sector,\" Medvedev said. The Prime Minister recalled that in 2016, these measures led to a growth in the light industry, in production of railway rolling stock, in forestry sector and other sectors. According to Medvedev, initially those measures were criticized in the Cabinet. \"But there is one criterion of truth - it is the result. If, despite these measures od support, the industry continued to decline, in that case it would be necessary to review them and to focus on other areas, but the industry is growing,\" the Prime Minister said. \"That\\'s why we decided to keep these measures of support,\" Medvedev said. He added that some of the support mechanisms will be revised and other forms of industrial incentives will be introduced.'],\n",
       " ['Development of Arctic boosts demand for qualified specialists \"?experts The region is in demand for well-trained experienced specialists skilled to working in the North MURMANSK. February 7. /TASS/. Development of the Arctic, as a priority direction of the Russian state polices, has increased the demand for qualified specialists in various fields. Experts say, the region is in demand for not adventurers, but for well-trained experienced specialists skilled to working in the North. Besides, of high demand are scientific suggestions on both development of the Arctic and on maintaining its natural conditions.   Analysts of the HeadHunter recruiting portal say that open positions in the Russian Arctic regions (like the Sakha Republic, Nenets, Yamal-Nenets, Chukotka) in January 2017 doubled year-on-year. \"The biggest demand was for sales positions (28% of the vacancies the regions published in January 2017), raw materials exploration and development (16%), banking (14%), blue-collar positions (13%), and personnel for production facilities (12%). Most vacancies come from companies related to production of gas, oil, minerals, to development of open pits or to industrial construction,\" the company said. Most often, the companies were looking for applicants with working experience from one to three years (40%) and from three to six years (32%), while 23% of listed jobs were for applicants without experience. The average offered salary of 60,000 rubles (about $1,000 a month) goes next to 174,000 rubles for a programmer or 157,000 for a mining engineer working shifts. Candidates most often are guaranteed not only food and bed, but also laundry services, libraries and gyms. Misbalance between demand and offer in human resources in terms of territory and professional skills - this is how expert of the Presidential Academy Vera Smorchkova characterized in a conversation with TASS the biggest problem, which affects the social and economic development of the Arctic regions. She said about a lack of a balanced system for training and forecast to see what professions will be of demand on the Arctic market in five or seven years.   The projects to implement systematic approaches in personnel training for the Arctic are only at the level of tests now. For example, the Murmansk region - the only part in the North-Western Federal District - is testing a standard of human resources for industrial growth purposes. The project involves employers, universities, authorities and the WorldSkills movement. The standard is used to forecast human resources demand and develop focused training, to organize independent evaluation of training, and the system for additional education for children. The region\\'s six leading companies have agreed to participate in the test: mining, shipbuilding and other companies. Across the country, the standard is tested in 21 regions. Northern regions also do not forget about representatives of the indigenous peoples. The department of education at the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous District told TASS about training of nomadic teachers for schools and kindergartens. \"Today, in Yamal\\'s tundra work 17 \"\\x98chum\"?(dwelling of nomadic peoples) kindergartens and five schools,\" the department said. Yakutia, for the purpose of supporting the locals, makes big companies working in the region employ the locals first of all, head of the region Yegor Borisov told TASS. \"Companies, working in development, do not have problems with personnel, and in work with those companies we set only one task - to employ more locals,\" he said. Thus, over the recent five years Alrosa (diamond producer) employed 18,000 local residents, and Surgutneftegaz (oil and gas producer) - 2,000 people. Companies working on Arctic projects - Norilsk Nickel, Rosneft, Gazprom and others - have been initiating educational programs. As yet, the Presidential Academy\\'s expert said, cooperation between educational institutions and businesses has been on first stages of development - only five percent of educational programs are implemented in cooperation with employers.   For example, Norilsk Nickel, under its corporate programs on working with students, cooperates with more than 15 Russian core universities. The company\\'s press service told TASS about a few working projects, including a program to develop human capital - Conquerors of the North, which in 2016 won the national competition among projects involving graduates and young specialists. The company\\'s second program is the Cup MISIS Case and the Cup Technical competitions in business cases. In 2016, more than 200,000 students from 65 universities in 25 cities participated in the first championship, and more than 350,000 from 250 universities in 35 cities participated in the second competition, which was aimed at solving more scientifically-technical practical cases. Many universities now give forecasts what professions will be of demand in the Arctic. For example, the Tyumen Oil and Gas University in 2000 opened a department of the Earth\\'s cryology. Academician Vladimir Melnikov says, every year the department educates specialists in studies of natural and natural-technical processes in the Earth\\'s cold regions. In 2016, the University opened the first in the world department of cryo studies, to working at which the University invited leading scientists from the U.S., Mexico, Israel, Finland, Sweden and Norway. The North (Arctic) Federal University opened the Arctic innovation center to implement results of research made by scientists and students. The university opened 24 small innovative companies to implement scientific results. One of the companies has offered technical characteristics and technology for production of autoclaved cellular concrete, using local mineral resources. Cooperation of universities, training specialists for work in the Arctic, with other countries in the educational and scientific spheres becomes a popular trend. The North (Arctic) University has close relations with educational institutions in Norway, Finland, Sweden, Canada and the U.S. More than 400 students and 300 teachers every year participate in academic exchange programs, and 80% of all the students\"?and 40% of the teachers\"?exchanges are organized with universities in the Arctic countries.'],\n",

Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law decriminalizing domestic violence. The law has been published on Russia\\'s official website containing legal information. The law declares domestic violence an administrative, rather than criminal, offence, provided it is a first-time transgression.-   The law amends Article 116 of the Russian Criminal Code by excluding physical assaults on relatives from criminal offences while a person who commits repeated assaults will face criminal charges. In June 2016, first-time battery was declared an administrative offence, however, it was announced that if those committing battery were motivated by hooliganism, political, ethnic and ideological enmity, or were assaulting their relatives, would face criminal charges. The decision whipped up turmoil in society leading to protests against first-time domestic battery being declared a criminal offence. According to Russian MP Yelena Mizulina, \"there are 59 articles stipulating criminal responsibility for violence\" so there is no need to amount domestic battery to physical assaults committed out of hooliganism or any kind of enmity. \"We mean physical assaults that do not require a medical report as they do not result in injuries, these are family disputes with minor consequences,\" she elaborated. The administrative offence for first-time battery envisages an arrest for ten to fifteen days, a fine of 5,000 to 30,000 rubles (roughly $85 - 500) or compulsory community service for 60-120 hours. Meanwhile, those charged with repeated assaults will face criminal charges under Article 116 of the Russian Criminal Code which stipulates a fine of up to 40,000 rubles (roughly $670), compulsory community service for up to six months or an arrest for up to three months. -'],\n",

It is premature to speak about introducing a visa-free travel for Georgia, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin said on Tuesday. \"One should not expect lifting visa requirements but to work in this direction,\" said the diplomat, who is holding another meeting in Prague with the Georgian Prime Minister\\'s Special Envoy for Relations with Russia Zurab Abashidze.   \"We are not against the visa-free regime, but we don\"t have diplomatic relations,\" he stressed. \"We need to calmly discuss all the measures concerning security of the two countries in the framework of the respective agencies,\" Karasin said. The diplomat also welcomed the decision of the European Parliament earlier this week to lift visa requirements for Georgia once a suspension mechanism allowing reintroducing visas with third countries enters into force. He voiced hope that this will help solve the issue on \"unblocking\" the citizens of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The two breakaway republics were recognized by Russia as independent states in August 2008. The visa regime between Russia and Georgia was imposed in 2000. In 2004, Georgia unilaterally eased it for Russian nationals. In March 2012, Tbilisi cancelled the visa regime for all Russian citizens. In December 2015, Russia\\'s Foreign Ministry said Moscow would ease the visa regime for Georgians from December 23, not ruling out that a mutual visa-free regime could be introduced in the future.'],\n",

The Egyptian Foreign Ministry has officially described the crash of the Russian airliner over the Sinai Peninsula in October 2015 as a terrorist attack, Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ahmed Abu Zeid, said on Tuesday in response to a list of 78 terrorist attacks, which did not get sufficient media coverage, released by the White House.   Commenting on critical remarks by US President, Donald Trump, who accused US media of covering up terrorist attacks in Europe and elsewhere by not reporting them, the Egyptian diplomat noted that 9 out of 78 attacks occurred in Egypt. \"Terrorist operations have killed dozens or even hundreds of people, including the crash of the Russian airliner in Sinai and the explosion of the al-Butrusia Coptic Church,\" he said. \"It is regrettable that the selectivity and bias criticized by Trump apply to the some Western media\\'s approach towards covering terrorist attacks.\" Egypt previously did not reject the version of a terror attack on board the Russian plane that crashed on October 31, 2015. However, Cairo has always pointed to the need to wait for the official results of the probe, which have not been made public to date.

       " ['Scientists unlock secrets that could breach second law of thermodynamics An international team of scientists under discovered that entropy can decrease in quantum systems MOSCOW, February 7. /TASS/ The law of non-decrease of entropy in closed systems, which is one of the formulations of the second law of thermodynamics, can be broken, said the press service of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT). An international team of scientists under the guidance of Gordey Lesovik, Chief Researcher at MIPT\\'s Laboratory of Quantum Theory of Information and the L. D. Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences discovered that entropy can decrease in quantum systems. The results of the study have been published in the journal Scientific Reports from the Nature publishing group. \"We have discovered Maxwell\\'s demon which can reduce the entropy in the system,\" Lesovik said. Maxwell\\'s demon is a mythic creature invented by British physicist James Clerk Maxwell in the second half of the 19th century in order to explain the paradox of the second law of thermodynamics. The demon should increase the orderliness of a system which by itself cannot grow in the isolated system according to the laws of physics. In the 1870s, Ludwig Boltzmann formulated the principle of growth of entropy (disorder) in his H-theorem which postulated that the value of entropy in a closed system can only increase or remain constant. For a long time, this theorem could not be proven in the framework of traditional statistical physics without additional restrictions. After establishing quantum mechanics, scientists suggested that the H-theorem was rooted in the quantum world. In the quantum theory of information, the important results were obtained which describe conditions when the entropy of a system does not diminish.   The group led by Lesovik first formulated the H-theorem in the language of quantum physics and for several years had tried to find proof of that theorem. As a result, the researchers uncovered conditions when the second law of thermodynamics can be locally breached. This can happen in quantum systems of relatively small but macroscopic size measuring a few centimeters or even meters. The notable difference between the classical and quantum approach is that in classical physics, the decrease of entropy is connected to the transmission of heat energy while in the quantum world, the reduction of entropy can take place without energy transfer but due to quantum entanglement. According to Lesovik, the researchers are planning to perform experiments in the near future to verify the effect. Such experiments will open the door to creating a new type of quantum coolers and power generators.-  '],\n",

Bashar al-Assad\\'s regime is legitimate and should be preserved, while Syria\\'s future must be determined by the people of the country. As for Iran, Trump currently has other priorities or just does not have enough hard facts,\" the diplomat stressed.   The Wall Street Journal earlier reported, citing high-ranking sources in the White House, Europe and some Arab countries, that the Trump administration is searching for ways of destroying the military and diplomatic alliance between Russia and Iran to accelerate the end of the conflict in Syria and step up the fight against the Islamic State (terrorist group, outlawed in Russia). The US will be unable to influence the Russia-Iran alliance directly, according to Vladimir Yevseyev, Deputy Director of the CIS Countries Institute. In his view, Washington can create problems indirectly, primarily by hampering the work of Russian businesses in Iran through new sanctions against Tehran or strengthening the existing ones. Discord in the Russia-Turkey-Iran troika in Syria is possible as well, and Moscow should prevent this from happening, the expert went on to say. \"The possible weak points are demands for Tehran to stop arms supplies to Hezbollah via Syria and the withdrawal of Revolutionary Guards advisers from that country. If that happens, Iran\\'s role in Syria will diminish substantially, which make combat operations more difficult, while Iran will get the impression that it has been excluded from the process. In that case, it may turn against Russia.\" - Moscow and Tbilisi will hold another round of consultations on mending bilateral relations in Prague on Tuesday. As usual, Russia is represented at the talks by Deputy Foreign Minister, Grigory Karasin, and Georgia - by Special Representative for Relations with Russia, Zurab Abashidze. Georgia has been doing its utmost in terms of abolishing visas for Russians and citizens of other countries, Abashidze told Nezavisimaya Gazeta. \"We have cancelled visa restrictions for Russian nationals,\" he said. \"They may stay in Georgia without visas for up to a year. For its part, Russia simplified visa requirements for Georgian citizens, which affected the number of issued visas. We heard the Russian president\\'s remarks about the possibility of abolishing visas. If Russia pushes ahead with its efforts in terms of simplifying requirements or abolishing visas, we will see that as a step in the right decision, which would be praised. The visa issue is Russia\\'s domain. If there are new proposals on this matter, we will hear them out and discuss them. When asked about the prospects for restoring diplomatic relations between Moscow and Tbilisi, Abashidze emphasized that that \"the issue will not be on the agenda as long as Georgia\\'s territorial integrity is violated.\" \"However, if the process of resolving the problems related to Abkhazia and South Ossetia begins, if significant progress is made, restoration of diplomatic relations could be included in the agenda at some point,\" he emphasized. - Russia\\'s Federal National Guard Troops Service will monitor rallies, concerts and football matches by using airships, Izvestia writes. These high-altitude reconnaissance devices equipped with cutting-edge optics will be able to pinpoint specific pockets of unrest, especially rabble-rousers and isolate them without endangering other people\\'s lives and wellbeing.   They could be used for the first time during the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup scheduled to be held in Russia this summer. A source in the Russian National Guard informed TASS that the use of aerial monitoring systems is a new direction in developing weapons for Russia\\'s National Guard Troops. \"As a rule, there is a small group of troublemakers who revel in sparking destructive activity. They are behind the masses of people who take to the streets,\" Sergey Melikov, First Deputy Director of the Russian National Guard, explained in an interview with the paper. \"Therefore, we need to localize such offenders and detain the instigators. We ensure people\\'s safety, first and foremost. We see our mission as preventing adverse conditions where mass discontent may escalate into mass civil disobedience.\" Meanwhile, Vsevolod Alexeyev, Chairman of the Society for Consumer Right\\'s Protection in Sports, told the paper that the proposed move could be of considerable help in ensuring security during the Confederations Cup and the FIFA World Cup. \"It is clear that security requirements during the World Cup and the Confederations Cup in Russia will be very stringent, and the task of all services involved is to minimize possible incidents. If aerial monitoring makes it possible to identify specific individuals who break the law, this will significantly contribute to ensuring security.\" - Moldova\\'s President, Igor Dodon, will soon start negotiations with other representatives of the Moldovan authorities on Transnistria and the presence of Russian peacekeepers there, presidential adviser for Transnistria, Vasile Sova, informed Nezavisimaya Gazeta. Prime Minister Pavel Filip earlier asked the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to again consider the issue of \"the illegal presence of Russian troops,\" including peacekeepers, in Moldova. According to Sova, Russian peacekeepers were deployed to that country under the 1992 agreement, which has a substantial legal base, which means that there are no grounds to question their presence. However, they could be replaced as part of the \"5+2\" international negotiation framework (Moldova and Transnistria as parties, Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE as mediators, and EU and the US as observers). Negotiations within this framework were frozen for several years. After the arrival of President Igor Dodon, a glimmer of hope appeared that they could be revived. Dodon was the first president who travelled to Tiraspol to meet with new Transnistria leader, Vadim Krasnoselsky, and struck a deal on regular meetings with him, the paper notes. \"The ruling coalition in Moldova never achieved any positive results during its negotiations with Transnistria,\" Irina Vlah, head of Moldova\\'s Gagauz autonomy, told the paper. \"But then Dodon appeared who is prepared for talks with Transnistria at any level. Dialogue is necessary, but there is no need to hurry,\" she said. - The latest wave of arrests in Turkey is not only part of a counter-terrorism campaign but also part of the preparations for the referendum on a new draft Constitution, which envisages transitioning the country from a parliamentary to a presidential republic, a source close to diplomatic circles in Ankara told Izvestia.   \"The vote is expected to be held in April,\" the source said. \"Meanwhile, Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, needs to tackle two problems, namely, the economic crisis and rampant terrorism. This will make it possible for him to get the required support from the Turkish population. So, the recent arrests should be seen from this perspective as well.\" According to the latest data, Turkish security forces have arrested nearly 800 people suspected of having links to the Islamic State (terrorist group, outlawed in Russia). Igor Morozov, member of Russia\\'s Federation Council (upper house of parliament) International Affairs Committee, said in an interview with the paper that this is further evidence of Ankara\\'s change in attitude towards those forces, which the Turkish leadership previously had turned a blind eye to. \"Turkey\\'s stance on the Islamic State has changed significantly. Erdogan saw that members of this group carry out terrorist attacks against Turkish officials. Very often, militants are a tool in the hands of the opponents of the Turkish president,\" Morozov explained. The senator added that the large-scale arrests can be seen negatively in Turkish society too, since many of Erdogan\\'s political opponents have been detained as well. - TASS is not responsible for the material quoted in the-press reviews'],\n",

Lavrov expressed condolences to the families of those killed in the avalanches in Afghanistan earlier this month, wishing a speedy recovery to the injured people. More than 100 people died in this tragedy between February 4 and 6. Lavrov called on Afghanistan to develop cooperation in preparing for natural disasters. Rabbani thanked Lavrov for offering condolences, noting that Afghanistan\\'s authorities are making every effort to reduce the aftermath of the disaster. \"This trip is important, we call for developing our relations. We have many topics for discussion, in particular, the fight against terrorism,\" Afghanistan\\'s foreign minister said. Russia and Afghanistan have established a close dialog between their special services to identify and eliminate terrorist groups, Lavrov said following talks with his Afghan counterpart. \"The anti-terror cooperation is an important topic and an element of our bilateral relationships,\" the minister said. \"We have an inter-governmental agreement on Russia\\'s military and technical assistance to Afghanistan. It has sealed the practice that has existed for already many years and practically helps to raise the combat potential of Afghanistan\\'s security services and the Afghan national army,\" Russia\\'s top diplomat said. \"Now we have an agreement and so the legal framework has been strengthened; it entered into force in November last year,\" the foreign minister said.

We will also help training national personnel of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, both in military and civilian occupations.\"   The international meeting on Afghanistan with participation of Russia, Pakistan, China, Iran and India will be held in Moscow in mid-February, -Lavrov said. \"We have a common understanding that there is the need to boost efforts (for reconciliation in Afghanistan). In this context, we confirmed the invitation for the Afghan colleagues for another meeting on Afghanistan\\'s settlement due in mid-February in Moscow, with participation of representatives of Russia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, China, Iran and India,\" Lavrov said. \"We expect that all partners will be represented at a high level, and most of them have already confirmed their participation,\" he said. Russia\\'s supports Afghanistan\\'s bid for full-fledged membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), according to Lavrov. \"We confirmed our support for the development of cooperation in assisting the Afghan settlement as part of the SCO, considering that this year India and Pakistan will join the SCO as full-format members and considering that Kabul filed a similar application in 2015 for full-fledged membership, a bid, which the Russian Federation supports,\" Lavrov said. Russia will continue working in favor of the approval of this application by all the SCO members, Russia\\'s top diplomat said. Moscow is prepared to establish contacts with the United States on Afghanistan and this will be to the benefit of everyone, first of all the Afghan people, Lavrov said. According to Lavrov, Russia maintained some contacts on Afghanistan with the previous US administration but they were \"sporadic\" and lacked confidence.   Russia\\'s top diplomat said he is convinced that Russia and the US will establish \"partner cooperation\" taking into consideration that US President Donald Trump confirmed that the fight against the Islamic State terrorist group is a top priority in the international affairs. \"As soon as the structures are formed in Washington, which will deal with the war on terror and the Afghan issue in broader terms, both in the State Department, the White House and other bodies of the US administration, I\\'m sure that our contacts will be established,\" Lavrov said. \"This will be to the benefit of everyone, including our Afghan friends,\" he said. The Russian diplomat also said that Russia supports the idea of plugging the Taliban into a dialog over future settlement in Afghanistan on the basis of UN Security Council resolutions. \"We have confirmed our common stance that-Taliban should be involved in a constructive dialog in keeping with the criteria contained in the UN Security Council resolutions,\" Lavrov said. Lavrov said the Taliban was trying \"to conduct the dialog on certain terms that do not quite suit our Afghan counterparts and in a situation where the Islamic State (terrorist organization outlawed in Russia), has been trying to get a foothold in Afghanistan.\"'],\n",

It is moving southwest, towards Moscow. The launch has taken place and this is most important,\" said Konyukhov Jr. For setting a new non-stop flight world record lasting more than 50 hours the adventurers are expected to avoid crossing air borders with other countries, because the wind may carry the balloon towards Ukraine, Belarus, Latvia and Lithuania. In that case the crew will have to land. Likewise the ambitious attempt will have to be terminated if the balloon ventures into Moscow\\'s airspace or if there is heavy snowfall.   Oskar Konyukhov said strong wind delayed the flight by two hours, but Konyukhov\\'s support team eventually managed to load the gondola with extra 75 fuel cylinders. \"The wind was strong.

Saint Isaac\\'s: The iconic St. Petersburg cathedral  Currently, there are many opportunities for successful cooperation of museums and the church, he stressed. \"Still, I\\'m a representative of the museum community and a member of the Russian presidium of the International Council of Museums (ICOM) and a member of the presidium of the Union of Museums of Russia, and my stance here is that I do not welcome the handover of St. Isaac\\'s Cathedral. I believe that there are much more opportunities for joint successful cooperation of museums and the church that complement each other,\" he said in an interview with TASS. The church and the museum community have joint tasks of \"preserving spirituality, morality, high moral and cultural values,\" Levykin said. \"We should not forget that the museum personnel preserved the church values in the extreme conditions during the post-revolutionary and the war time, sometimes at the expense of their own life,\" he said.   During the Soviet time, the State Historical Museum in Moscow incorporated the Krutitsy Metochion, containing historic buildings erected in the late 17th century, and the Novodevichy Convent, a UNESCO world heritage site and burial place of many famous figures. These two sites were handed over to the Orthodox Church some 20 years ago and in 2010, respectively. Saint Basil\\'s Cathedral, one of symbols of Russia and a major tourist attraction, which became part of the Historical Museum in 1928, has been jointly managed by the museum and the Orthodox Church for a quarter of a century already. Every Sunday and twice a year worship service is held in the cathedral. During this time, the access of tourists is limited to create convenient conditions for the believers. The plans by the St. Petersburg government to hand over St. Isaac\\'s Cathedral to the Orthodox Church have stirred up a lot of public controversy. The announcement was followed by protests throughout the city. More than 200,000 people have signed a petition against the handover of the cathedral, one of Russia\\'s most popular museums visited by some 3.5 mln tourists annually. Mikhail Piotrovsky, Director of the State Hermitage Museum, has asked Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Kirill to revoke the handover request to stop public protests. The cathedral was built in 1818-1858 and transformed into a museum after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. Church services were resumed at St. Isaac\\'s in 1990. However, St. Isaac\\'s was not property of the Orthodox Church even prior to the revolution since its maintenance was very expensive.

Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan told a news conference on Tuesday a council for joint economic operations with Russia on the Southern Kuril-Islands had been set up in Japan.   He told reporters he would stand at the head of the entity personally. Hiroshige Seko, a deputy minister of economy, commerce and industry who supervises economic cooperation with Russia in the government, will be deputy head of the council while representatives of other departments concerned high rank officials from the finance, agriculture and fishing industry ministries will take seats on it, well-informed sources told TASS. \"We hope to get down to tackling the problems of joint economic operations on the islands through the efforts of our entire government,\" Kishida said at the news conference. Sources also indicated the council will consider concrete projects of cooperation in the area of Southern Kurils, including fisheries, seafood farming, tourism, and nature conservation. Along with it, this cooperation should not call into question Russia and Japan\\'s fundamental positions as regards the sovereignty over the islands. Russia and Japan reached agreement on a start of consultations on joint economic operations on the Southern Kurils upon the end of Russian President Vladimir Putin\\'s visit to Japan on in the middle of last December. The first round of the consultations at the level of deputy foreign ministers is to take place in Tokyo next month. Moscow made first attempts to reach arrangements on joint economic activity on Southern Kuril Islands-at the end of the 1990\\'s but they encountered Japan\\'s reluctance to agree to putting this type of cooperation on the basis of Russian legislation.

This is still some way off from Palmyra but I don\"t have any doubts its turn will come soon,\" Kinshchak said. \"Mass media are talking a lot about the situation in the ancient part of Palmyra and that\\'s why I don\"t see any need in an expanded advertising of the organization of diehard terrorists, which is banned in Russia, or in further comments on their barbaric actions against the monuments of the antique civilization,\" Kinshchak said. In March 2016, Syrian Army units supported by the Russian Aerospace Force liberated Palmyra after ten-months-long control by the IS. Russian army engineers took part in mine-clearing efforts in the city. On December 9, the IS attacked Palmyra again. The government troops retreated from the central part of the city on the night of December 11.

The new devices exhibit very high efficiency in light conversion (10.5%) comparable with those of perovskite batteries based on classical hybrid materials (about 12%). \"Our devices demonstrate tremendous efficiency and excellent repeatability of electric characteristics from sample to sample,\" one of the study\\'s coauthors, Professor Pavel Troshin of the Center for Electrochemical Energy Storage said. \"The obtained results demonstrate on the high potential of inorganic complex halogenides which offers new opportunities for target design of photoactive materials for effective and stable perovskite solar batteries.\" Perovskite is a mineral which is rare on the Earth surface, calcium titanate, while perovskites are various materials with crystal lattice similar to those of perovskite. In 2009, it was shown that perovskites are capable of effectively converting visual light into electricity, and ever since then they have been seen as a very prospective candidate for developing solar energy. In 2013, Science, one of the world\\'s most reputable scientific journals, included perovskite-based solar batteries into the top 10 main breakthroughs of the year. Batteries made from perovskites are cheaper than those based on silica and their production is non-toxic. These batteries can be made thin and flexible in order to place them on the surfaces of various curvatures. Nowadays, the best efficiency of conversion light into electricity is achieved by hybrid perovskite photocells based on organic-inorganic materials APbI3 where A can be various organic cations (A=CH3NH2+ or HC(NH2)2+). The performance coefficient of laboratory prototypes of such devices reaches 22% approaching the characteristics of photoelements based on crystalline silica. However, the commercialization of those setups is hindered by their poor service durability. Upon functioning, they deteriorate very fast due to thermal and photochemical decomposition of perovskites. The most efficient approach to creating stable perovskite materials is a complete replacement of organic cations to inorganic ones. However, such substitution is normally accompanied by a decrease in the devices\"?efficiency. For example, the solar cells based on CsPbI3 created by precipitation from the solution showed only 2-3% efficiency in light conversion. In the new study, the Russian scientists suggested producing CsPbI3 using another technology - thermic co-evaporation of cesium and lead iodides. As a result, the solar batteries based on these inorganic perovskites have demonstrated a stable performance efficiency figure of about 10%. Herewith, the reference samples of solar cells with an analogous architecture based on coatings of hybrid perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 demonstrate a comparable efficiency of 10-12%. The results of the study have been published in the Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters.'],\n",

Researchers from Russia, the UK, and Switzerland demonstrated that the endothelin receptors type B have almost no influence of the fission of cells of unstriated muscles of vessels, the press service of Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology said. The results of the study imply that to cope with the vessel diseases, remedies need to be developed aimed at interacting with endotheline receptors type A (ETA) and time should not be spent on working with endotheline receptors B (ETB). The article describing the study has been published in the journal Hypertension.   \"The experiments show no significant role of ETB receptors in the proliferation of smooth muscle cells. This is new information which may potentially save lots of money and effort just by pointing out the way which one should not follow, and namely, creating an ETB antagonist based anti-atherosclerotic drugs,\" commented Skoltech Professor Yury Kotelevtsev, Associate Director of Skoltech Center for Functional Genomics, and a coauthor of the study. Endothelines are substances synthesized by the human body for constricting vessels. In order for them to function, they must be bound to corresponding receptors which are located in the vascular walls. These receptors can be classified into two types: A (ETA) and B (ETB). The ETA and ETB receptors govern the processes of vessels constriction and distension, as well as the growth of their tissues, and consequently play an important role in the evolution of some diseases, for instance, pulmonary hypertension and atherosclerosis. To clarify the role of ETB receptor in the control of growth of smooth muscles cells, the scientists switched off the genes coding the receptor. Using a mouse, they damaged the arterial walls in the limb of the rodent to track the growth of vessel tissues without ETB receptors and found out that this receptor has almost no effect on the fission of cells after vessel damage. According to Kotelevtsev, the scientists expected to come to sharply contradicting conclusions. But now, additional experiments have been scheduled, since these crucial results must be rechecked before finally being validated.'],\n",

The fund could be used to finance mega projects to revive the economy, but would lead to greater political control of companies. Turkey has transferred government stakes worth billions of dollars in its flag carrier Turkish Airlines, the country\\'s largest bank by assets Ziraat Bank and fixed-line operator Turk Telekom to a sovereign wealth fund (SWF). Some analysts told DW that ahead of the planned presidential referendum, which would allow President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to consolidate his power, this move would lead to greater political control of the companies, but without the necessary oversight. Analysts also said that the newly transferred assets could be used as collateral to secure funding for major infrastructure projects. Political control \"The move is likely to increase political control over the companies now owned by the SWF,\" said Wolfango Piccoli, director of research at advisory firm Teneo Intelligence. \"The transfer of state assets to the SWF comeses at a time of increasing political involvement in the economy,\" he said. Piccoli said that over the last 18 months, more than 600 privately-owned companies have been seized by the government on suspicion of links with the-exiled Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, who Erdogan blames for orchestrating the failed July 15 coup attempt last year. More than 600 privately-owned companies have been seized by the government over the last 18 months In the third quarter, the economy shrank for the first time in almost seven years while investors worry that the structural reform agenda would stall due to Erdogan\\'s ambition to boost the economy ahead of the presidential referendum. \"The creation of the wealth fund will, in all probability, allow Erdogan and his team to exercise greater control over companies in which the state already owns large stakes, but without the level of transparency demanded by members of Turkey\\'s political opposition (especially the CHP),\" Anthony Skinner, director of the Middle East and North Africa practice at Verisk Maplecroft, told DW. Mega Projects The Erdogan government in 2013 announced 200 billion dollars worth of infrastructure investments as part of its 2023 goals. Building a waterway and the world\\'s largest airport in Istanbul were among these goals, as Erdogan has been relying on large scale projects to bolster the construction industry and boost domestic demand. The economy has slowed following the coup attempt and analysts said that President Erdogan aims to revive the stalling economy with mega projects. \"The creation of the fund confirms the government\\'s goal to drive large infrastructure projects forward to boost economic growth over the coming years. Infrastructure mega-projects and the government\\'s diplomatic offensive to expand exports are intended to help offset the impact of reduced domestic consumption and demand in 2017,\" Verisk Maplecroft\\'s Skinner said. In recent months, Erdogan has applied intense pressure to commercial banks to increase loans to the private sector in an attempt to boost flagging economic growth. Erdogan has also been pressuring the central bank for some time to lower interest rates to support economic growth. The country has been hit by rising regional tensions, political uncertainties amid widening concern about the crackdown following the failed coup, which also battered its currency. \"The government is currently struggling to finance a series of high-profile infrastructure projects. Erdogan hopes these will boost his domestic prestige and enable him to consolidate his grip on power through the introduction of an executive presidential system with almost no checks or balances,\" said Piccoli. The Yavuz Sultam Selim bridge, which spans the banks of the Bosphorus, was opened in August 2016 Fiscal discipline? Some are concerned about the motive of the decision, despite the claims by the government that the fund will not compromise fiscal discipline. \"I think there are several reasons for concern. One is that it suggests that Turkey is unlikely to privatize key companies in which the state has an interest (providing further evidence that the reform agenda is unlikely to restart). Another reason is that it could provide scope for a significant loosening of fiscal policy,\" Capital Economics economist William Jackson told DW. The fund, approved by parliament in August, is headed by Mehmet Bostan, a former banker and head of the privatization administration last year. Appointments to the board included Erdogan\\'s advisers and aides. Sovereign wealth funds are often associated with oil producing countries, such as Norway or Gulf states, who set aside money from energy exports for investment. Norway\\'s $890-billion (832 billion euros) sovereign wealth fund is the world\\'s largest. \"One final point I would make is that we tend to think of wealth funds (such as those in the Gulf) having significant foreign currency assets; ultimately, those can be sold to improve the balance of payments position. But, Turkey\\'s wealth fund would hold lira assets, so it couldn\\'t be used in the event of another balance of payments shock,\" Jackson said. Opposition politicians expressed concerned about the move. Opposition party CHP lawmaker and former treasury undersecretary Faik Oztrak told a press conference that \"this government set up a wealth fund to pledge the assets left by our ancestors to borrow and cover up the volatility in the economy until the referendum.\"'],\n",
       " ['Poland wants nuclear weapons for Europe Jaroslaw Kaczynski, chairman of Poland\\'s ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS), has in a newspaper interview called for a European nuclear superpower. Is this a debate we really need to have? The strongman of Poland\\'s ruling national-conservative party has stoked a debate that was previously held in only a very limited capacity. In an interview with the daily \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung,\" Jaroslaw Kaczynski said Europe should be a superpowerwith a nuclear arsenal to rival that of Russia. He conceded that such a program would, however, be very costly and that he did not anticipate such investment. That aside, Kaczynski has broached a taboo subject typically only embraced by individual voices. One example is German parliamentarian Roderich Kiesewetter, of the conservative Christian Democrats, who recently told Reuters news agency that \"Europe needs nuclear protection as a deterrent\" if the United States were no longer to extend its protection. But how realistic are such ideas? Franco-British nuclear capability? \"It\\'s not surprising that we\\'r seeing this kind of debate now,\" said Nick Witney, former head of the European Defense Agency and now a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. In principle, it\\'s about the question of whether US President Donald Trump is prepared to sacrifice Chicago to save Warsaw. And what would his answer to that be? The political situation has changed so quickly, and with it the current state of defense policy. But how credible would a European nuclear deterrent be? Thirty years ago, London and Paris would have been flattered to be chosen as the defenders of the European continent. But what EU state would be prepared to accept such a nuclear defense force now? Never mind what Britain\\'s decision to leave the EU has done to whatever credibility that idea still had. How credible would Britain be as a nuclear deterrent power for Europe? For his part, Witney says he doesn\"t believe in a common European nuclear power. \"You would need institutions for that which the EU doesn\"t have,\" he said. That leaves just France with its nuclear weapons which, in an emergency, could perhaps still just about \"rip the arm off of a Russian bear.\" Witney\\'s conclusion: \"The discussion is very much one that is on the fringe, if not completely out of the realm of the possible.\" EU nuclear weapons would be a mistake \"There is no concrete threat,\" said Ulrich K¨¹hn of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The arguments for such a discussion are all there now in the Trump era, but at the same time, he says, this is \"not helpful.\" NATO still exists, and under US leadership, conventional weapons are being stationed in Poland stationed in Poland and the Baltics. As long as NATO exists, Europeans should stay away from a nuclear race, he said. Moreover, K¨¹hn added, the suggestions are not practical. \"Russia has between 2,000 and 3,000 tactical nuclear weapons,\" meaning that Europe would face enormous expenses if it were to acquire an adequate arsenal to serve as a deterrent. And the main question is who would control the red button? Aside from these issues, there\\'s also the fact that a majority of European citizens, including those in Poland, are against engaging in a nuclear arms race. K¨¹hn also believes it is dangerous that the non-proliferation treaty would effectively be voided if the Europeans were to withdraw from it. \"That would have global consequences,\" he said. \"You could suddenly see the creation of 55 to 60 nuclear countries - a horrific scenario.\" Instead, he said, the Europeans should finally do what they have long talked about doing: Take concrete steps towards realizing defense cooperation, sign agreements and work together on weapons systems in order to be more effective and credible in conventional defense measures. Gahler: \\'We don\"t want to revive the old arms debates of the 1980s\\' No to a nuclear arms race Michael Gahler of the defense committee in European Parliament is also in favor of greater EU-wide cooperation. \"We should finally do what the Lisbon Treaty allows us to do, which is to implement structural cooperation,\" he said. Of the 203 billion euros ($217 billion) spent on defense in the EU, 26 billion could be saved or otherwise allocated if the member states would only work together, according to a parliamentary paper on common defense policy. \"Common acquisition, common exercises and common structures\" are the next steps, according to Gahler. But he also said that a nuclear arms race would be a mistake. Although he perceives Russian tactical nuclear weapons as a real threat, he believes that overall, there is a balance when it comes to nuclear deterrents. \"We don\"t want to revive the old arms debates of the 1980s,\" Gahler said. While he admitted that Russia and the United States of today were not foreseeable at the turn of the century, Gahler remains firm in his belief that \"this is a debate that should not be started.\"'],\n",

Boko Haram\\'s attacks and military counter-offensives have displaced at least 2.3 million people. The Lake Chad Basin is grappling with a humanitarian emergency affecting some 17 million people across north-eastern Nigeria, northern-Cameroon, western Chad and Niger. Many of those affected have had to flee their homes. The majority of the displaced are sheltered by communities who are themselves among the world\\'s most vulnerable.- The Lake Chad Basin crisis was until recently one of-the fastest growing refugee-crises in Africa and it is becoming the most acute food and nutritional crisis in Africa. It is the fourth biggest humanitarian response for United Nations (UN) and non-governmental organisations-in 2017. Toby Lanzer, the assistant Secretary-General to the UN, spoke to DW ahead of the Oslo Humanitarian Conference on Nigeria and the Lake Chad Region at the end of February.- DW: How is the humanitarian situation in the Lake Chad region? Toby Lanzer: The situation continues to be very grave. I think over the past few months we have understood more fully what is happening thanks to an improved security situation which has enabled the United Nations and its partners to travel further afield from the main town, Maiduguri, and get a stronger appreciation from the people themselves who have been stuck in many villages and towns. -But we know that there are millions of people in desperate need of humanitarian assistance and we are doing our utmost together with the international community to meet the needs. Lanzer says the displaced often end up in vulnerable regions Has the response from-foreign governments been adequate? Well, adequate is a difficult word to use. And I think there are so many crises in different parts of the world. I think that via DW and others we are hoping to get the word out. That there is a particularly grave crisis the numbers are huge 10 million in need, 7 million who are severely food insecure, and 515,000 children who are acutely malnourished. I don\"t think any single government on earth in the world could face that alone. International solidarity is required. And that is required at a time when pressures are high all over the globe and so, no, the response is inadequate at the moment but am hopeful that in coming weeks more countries will come on board and help the UN and NGOs-to work with the communities and the authorities of Cameroon, Chad, Niger and of course of Nigeria, to meet the needs. What support do you want from the German government?- I think Germany has really come on board as a very strong supporter in political terms and the chancellor herself has been to Niger one of the key countries in this region. I think that political support usually signals financial support which I understand will be on its way. -And at the end of the day, that\\'s actually what people need because the money will be translated into medicines, food, shelter, and all the other things that people who are in desperate need require on a day to day basis to weather this terrible storm that\\'s afflicted them. What is your wish as far as the donor\\'s conference is concerned? There will be a conference thanks to Germany, Nigeria and Norway, and with support of the UN, the international community will gather in Oslo Norway on the February 24. I think my wish there is really a stronger recognition by a broader range of countries including Canada, the Netherlands, and Korea. Let\\'s say a broader range of countries who recognize the gravity of the situation and the scale of the need and that that they actually join the effort of countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States and the-European Commission and the UN in meeting peoples various serious need to survive this violence-perpetrated by Boko Haram, which comes on top of abject poverty, climate change and real challenges which have wrecked peoples lives and made it so very difficult for them.- What could the governments of the countries located in the Lake Chad region do? - We are hopeful that, whether it\\'s Cameroon, Chad, Niger or Nigeria,-they will continue to do what they have been which is to do that utmost to care for their own people. But there are limits to what poor countries can do. And you know on that note so many people look at me and say \"-isn\"t -Nigeria a rich country?\" Well it is and it is not. At the moment oil production has plummeted.-Oil prices are low so it\\'s a very trying moment for Nigeria to do everything that it would like to for its own-people. But let\\'s congratulate the government of Nigeria and others in the region for having facilitated the work of the aid agencies. For having made sure that we feel welcome,-for making sure that we are safe. This is a difficult part oft the world to be operating in. Violent extremists are not particularly easy by any means when it comes to the populations of the region, but also aid agencies.

DeVos champions voucher programs-that allow parents to send their children to the school of their choice - including privately-run, for-profit schools. Teachers advocates believe that this would hurt the funding of public-schools. The 59-year old also-garnered criticism from-civil rights advocates for her conservative religious beliefs. Two Republicans broke-rank in order to oppose DeVos\\' confirmation, along with all 46-Senators from the Democratic Party and two Independents-closely affiliated with the Democrats. A champion for school choice Democrats held the floor of the Senate for 24 hours ahead of the vote-in an effort to halt DeVos\\' confirmation. They repeatedly-criticized her lack of experience - the businesswoman has never worked in education --as well as the fact that DeVos has-financial stakes in-organizations promoting private schools. DeVos has-promised to divest herself from these-organizations. During her confirmation hearing, the wealthy Republican donor at times stumbled, leading her opponents to argue that she was unfamiliar with key debates in education policy. President Donald Trump stood by DeVos, describing her as a \"reformer\" and-accusing Democrats of protesting to \"keep the failed status quo\".- Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConell argued in favor of DeVos ahead of the vote, saying that she would-empower states to make important education decisions instead of federal bureaucrats. \"I know that she is committed to improving our education system so that every child - every child - has a brighter future,\" McConell said.- Not the only controversial pick While many of Trump\\'s cabinet picks have already been confirmed, Republicans are hoping to vote another batch of nominees into office this week: Senator Jeff Sessions as attorney general, Representative Tom Price as health secretary and hedge fund manager Steve Mnuchion as treasury secretary. Sessions in particular has been deemed a controversial choice - in 1986, the US Senate denied him a federal judgeship because of controversial, racially-charged-statements former colleagues testified Sessions had made.- Pence (57) is an experienced politician. After working as a lawyer and conservative talk radio host, he served for 12 years in the House of Representatives before becoming governor of Indiana in 2013. The father of three has strongly opposed abortion rights and same-sex marriage throughout his career. He has described himself as \"a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.\" The CEO of oil giant Exxon Mobil has close ties with Russian president Vladimir Putin - he was even awarded Russia\\'s \"Order of Friendship\" in 2013. Despite this, and the Texan businessman\\'s lack of experience in foreign policy, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee narrowly approved Tillerson\\'s nomination. Priebus (44), a lawyer and familiar face on the Wisconsin political scene, has served as director of the Republican National Committee since 2011. He has said that the Trump administration will aim to \"create an economy that works for everyone, secure our borders, repeal and replace Obamacare and destroy radical Islamic terrorism.\" After a long career on Wall Street at Goldman Sachs, Mnuchin (53) set up a hedge fund and made millions of dollars buying and rebranding a failed mortgage lender after the 2008 crash. He has since financed several Hollywood movies. Mnuchin wants to cut taxes for businesses and the middle class and will consider public-private partnerships to fund infrastructure projects. The retired Army general - and registered Democrat - was fired as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014. He has referred to Islamism as \"a vicious cancer inside the body of 1.7 billion people on this planet\" and his son, a Trump aide, recently lost his job for spreading a fake news story that claimed Hillary Clinton\\'s allies were running a pedophile ring from a Washington pizzeria. The Alabama Senator was one of the first members of Congress to endorse Trump. A former lawyer, Sessions (69) takes a hard line on immigration and strongly opposes legalizing of marijuana. Allegations of racism, including a former colleague\\'s testimony that Sessions joked he thought the Ku Klux Klan were \"okay, until I found out they smoked pot,\" cost him a potential federal judgeship in 1986. During his 44-year military career, Mattis (66) earned nicknames like \"Mad Dog\" and \"warrior monk.\" He led the US Central Command from 2011 to 2013, and was a key figure in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. His appointment as Defense Secretary would depend on a waiver from the Senate, as US law requires that retired military personnel wait seven years before they can take up this role. Upon his retirement in January 2016, Kelly (66) was the longest serving Marine general in US history. As head of the US Southern Command, he was responsible for US military activity in South and Central America, which included oversight of the controversial Guantanamo Bay detention facility in Cuba. Kelly\\'s eldest son was killed in combat in Afghanistan in 2010. The Montana lawmaker and former Navy SEAL commander had been expected to run for the Senate in 2018. Zinke (55) has advocated increased energy drilling and mining on federally controlled land. While skeptical about the urgency of climate change, he does believe it is important for the United States to invest in renewable energy. He describes himself as a \"Teddy Roosevelt Republican.\" The former Indiana senator was US ambassador to Germany from 2001 to 2005 under the George W. Bush administration. Coats (73) is considered a mainstream Republican and served on the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services committees. A vocal critic of Russia, he pushed for Moscow to be punished for its annexation of Crimea in 2014. The Kansas congressman is a member of the Republican Tea Party movement and a former Army tank officer. Pompeo (52) has defended the use of torture methods, such as waterboarding, and opposes the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison. He once said that Edward Snowden, who exposed the National Security Agency\\'s mass domestic surveillance program in 2013, deserved to receive the death penalty. The two-time presidential hopeful said during his 2012 run that, should he get into the White House, he would scrap the Department of Energy. Perry (66), who served as governor of Texas for 14 years, sits on the board for the parent company of Dakota Access LLC, which is pushing to build the controversial Dakota Access pipeline. He once called Trump a \"cancer on conservatism.\" The former chairman of right-wing website Breitbart News became Trump\\'s campaign chief in August. His CV also includes stints as a naval officer, investment banker and Hollywood producer. Ben Shapiro, a former editor-at-large of Breitbart, described Bannon as \"a nasty figure\" and \"a smarter version of Trump\". Carson, a retired neurosurgeon from Michigan, made his first foray into politics as one of Trump\\'s rivals in the Republican presidential primary. During the campaign, Carson made controversial comments on topics such as evolution and climate change. The investor and former banker made billions in restructuring failing companies in industries such as steel and coal, later investing in troubled European banks during the financial crisis. Ross, 79, was a vocal Trump supporter during the election campaign and believes the US needs a \"more radical, new approach to government.\" Lighthizer served as deputy trade representative during Ronald Reagan\\'s presidential administration. He returns to government after working as a lawyer for US steel companies for nearly three decades. Like Trump, the 71-year old has argued that the US needs to defend its economic interests against China more aggressively to reduce the US-China trade deficit. Andy Puzder, chief executive of CKE Restaurants, which runs fast food chains Hardee\\'s and Carl\\'s Jr., has long argued against higher minimum wages and government regulation in the workplace. He has frequently criticized the new Labor Department rule that extends overtime pay to more than 4 million workers, and praised the benefits of automation in the fast food industry. As a prominent figure in the \"school choice\" movement and chair of the American Federation for Children, DeVos is an advocate of charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately run. She is a long-time Republican Party donor and her father-in-law is Richard DeVos, the billionaire founder of US company Amway. In 2001, Chao was appointed Labor Secretary under George W. Bush, becoming the first woman of Asian descent to take a US Cabinet position. She previously worked in banking and as director of the Peace Corps, expanding its presence in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Chao (63) immigrated to the USA from Taiwan at the age of eight and is now married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The former orthopedic surgeon was elected to the House of Representatives in 2012 and named Budget Committee chair in 2015. Price, 62, is a staunch opponent of Obamacare, advocating a system based on medical savings accounts. Price has voted against federal funding for abortion and opposes gun control. Over the past five years, the Oklahoma state attorney general - a vocal climate-change skeptic - has brought multiple lawsuits against the very organization he is now due to lead. Pruitt said: \"I intend to run this agency in a way that fosters both responsible protection of the environment and freedom for American businesses.â\\x80?The former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) spent an estimated $100 million on two unsuccessful Senate campaigns in 2010 and 2012. She has supported reduced financial regulation and a lower corporate tax rate. Trump described her as \"one of the country\\'s top female executives advising businesses around the globe.\" Mulvaney was voted into the House of Representatives in 2011 as a \"Tea Party\" Republican. As someone who opposes federal governmental spending, the 49-year old from South Carolina could help Trump defund the Affordable Care Act, but might also be at odds with his trillion dollar infrastructure investment plan. Donald Trump\\'s son in law, who already served a pivotal role in his campaign, will also serve as an adviser in the Trump administration. The son of real-estate tycoon Charles Kushner is married to Trump\\'s daughter Ivanka. He previously worked in real estate and publishing and had never worked in politics before the start of the Trump campaign. Haley (44) is serving her second term as the Governor for South Carolina. After the mass shooting at an African-American church in Charleston in 2015, Haley, who is the daughter of Indian immigrants, pushed for the confederate flag to be removed from the grounds of the South Carolina state house. She referred to Trump\\'s proposal for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the US as \"un-American.\" Shulkin already served as Under Secretary of Veterans Affairs for Health under President Barack Obama.

The accused had deluged authorities with written objections to fines and confiscation orders \"in which they expressed their crude legal views and lodged counterclaims,\" according to the Ingolstadt police bureau.

British lawmakers in Westminster are-currently debating-legislation which will start the Brexit process.

It is a key test of whether Scotland\\'s voice is being listened to and whether our wishes can be accommodated within the UK process,\" Sturgeon said. Soon after the vote, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon-confirmed the result-on Twitter, writing that Scottish parliament had voted \"overwhelmingly\" against triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Although the vote was non-binding, Tuesday\\'s outcome could now serve as groundwork for a second referendum for Scottish independence.-The UK\\'s Supreme Court-ruled last month that the launch of Brexit-talks with the EU must be approved by the British parliament, but that May has no-legal obligation to consult the devolved administrations in Scotland,-Wales and Northern Ireland.

       " ['German intelligence \\'finds no evidence of Putin disinformation campaign\\' Germany\\'s secret services have found little evidence that the Kremlin is directly trying to manipulate the country\\'s public opinion. But the leaked government report suggests that indirect methods may be at work. Russian President Vladimir Putin is not deliberately trying to undermine Chancellor Angela Merkel ahead of her impending re-election campaign - or at least, if he is, he is hiding his tracks well. That\\'s the inconclusive conclusion that Germany\\'s foreign and domestic intelligence agencies came to last fall, following several months of investigation which was delivered to Merkel\\'s chief-of-staff Peter Altmaier in the form of a 50-page report. Altmaier chose not to make the report public, but it was leaked to the \"S¨¹ddeutsche Zeitung\" newspaper this week. According to the paper, the BND (Germany\\'s equivalent of the CIA) and its domestic counterpart, the Verfassungsschutz (BfV), was charting a \"middle way\" between two conclusions - firstly, that the Russian government is not directly spreading misinformation in Germany, and, secondly, that it is, but it couldn\\'t be proven. \"An open/direct control or financing through Russian state authorities or Russian intelligence agencies could not be proven in any cases,\" the report said. Nevertheless, such activities \"could be carried out by people and organizations outside the services.\" Though these various external protagonists \"were not playing a prominent role in endangering Germany\\'s security interests,\" \"further investigative efforts\" were still necessary, the intelligence agents added. Merkel commissioned the report into Russian intervention Threads to the Kremlin Despite not being able to find any direct evidence, the German spies seemed convinced that the Russian government is coordinating a campaign to \"sow disunity in the EU and Germany, and so to weaken their position of power\" from the highest levels of the Russian government: \"The bundling of all the influencing activities in the presidential administration does represent a significant success factor.\" The report listed three well-publicized examples of how Russian actors may have spread misinformation in Germany - or at least about Germany. The first was the case of \"Lisa,\" a 13-year-old Russian-German living in Berlin, who told police in January 2016 that she had been raped by people of \"Mediterranean appearance.\" Though she later admitted to having made the story up, the case made international headlines and sparked protests outside Merkel\\'s office by both far-right groups and the Russian community in Berlin. The situation escalated when Russian state media and the Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused the German police of covering up the crime. \"The news that she disappeared was kept secret for a very long time,\" Lavrov told a press conference. The newly-leaked German intelligence report also noted a Russian-language WhatsApp message that was widely distributed among Russian-speaking Germans last winter, which read, \"Muslims organizing a sex-jihad in Europe on February 14.\" This was part of a conspiracy theory alleging that a Muslim hate preacher had called on his followers to mass-rape German women on that date. Since the message was deemed \"amateurish,\" the German intelligence agencies concluded there was no involvement from Russian secret services. Meanwhile in other cases, the German chancellery decided that the agency\\'s conclusions were too speculative - one of the reasons it was not made public. No clear agenda Mark Galeotti, Russian security specialist at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said this lack of clarity was nothing new. \"There\\'s no question that Russia is supporting and sponsoring a campaign to use disinformation to try and have a political impact,\" he told DW. \"The issue isn\\'t: \\'Is there a fake news campaign?\\' Yes, of course there is. The issue is: \\'Is all fake news Russian?\\' The answer is clearly not.\" Altmaier said much of the evidence was inconclusive \"There is evidence of the Kremlin\\'s involvement, but there isn\\'t evidence of how effective it is,\" Galeotti said. \"The Kremlin puts a lot of money into its soft power arms like [state news outlet] RT and we know that the Kremlin lies to a considerable degree for political effect. We also know there are attempts to carry out more covert and subversive acts - secret funding for political groups, that kind of thing.\" Indeed, the new German report found \"possible Russian influence attempts\" being made on Germany\\'s nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Russia\\'s alleged hack on the Democratic National Convention in the US last year unsettled many in Germany who wonder whether the Kremlin may be planning a similar attempt to sabotage the Bundestag election in September - even if the hack\\'s ultimate effect on the US vote, balanced against other factors, is impossible to quantify. Not only that, is toppling Merkel actually Moscow\\'s conscious policy? \"Well maybe - but there\\'s a certain degree of stability in having Merkel as chancellor, and you never know quite what an alternative government would mean,\" pointed out Galeotti. \"It\\'s not like the Russians want to conquer Europe - I don\\'t believe that for a minute - but what they do want to do is ensure that Europe is too divided to prevent Russia from imposing its will on Ukraine, and Belarus, and Georgia.\" Furthermore, just because Russia has state news outlets doesn\\'t mean they are constantly being controlled by the state. \"I know people who work in the RT newsroom,\" said Galeotti. \"Occasionally, yes, there is the phone call that says, \\'this is the line\\' when something big happens. But usually when there\\'s a story, there are bunch of people who know roughly what the Kremlin wants, and they say, \\'can we use this, can we spin this?\\' It\\'s almost entrepreneurial disinformation. It\\'s opportunistic.\"'],\n",
       " [\"Opinion: This is not Echte Liebe The violent attacks on Saturday in Dortmund are damaging for German football. Regardless of what Dortmund fans feel about tradition, violence is never the solution, writes Jonathan Harding. At the bottom of theS¨¹dtribune on Saturday, a large, yellow banner with black words read: -'For the people's sport of football, against those who destroy it.' Dortmund-fans' are absolutely entitled to defend the tradition of their club. But the ugly scenes that marred one of the Bundesliga's biggest games of the season-showed a demonstration of pride isn't enough for them, they now want to-attack the freedom of other fan's to oppose those views. Not just with banners but with makeshift weapons. The assaults on-blameless Leipzig fans must have come as a shock to the numerous people who gaze at Germany's football culture with-envy. Even before Germany won the World Cup in 2014, the country worked-hard to market 'the German football experience' --and with good reason. Cheap tickets, great atmosphere, the inclusive role fans play - and the great football. Hundreds flew in for a weekend of football at Borussia Dortmund or Schalke. It was a chance to become part of a raw football community centered around Saturday afternoons. The imposing-yellow and black wall in-the Signal Iduna Park is one of the main reasons so many travel to Dortmund, but there was something very-different about it on Saturday. Even before the game, the atmosphere-felt tenser. By the time the game-kicked off-it sounded louder. It turned out it was also a lot more sinister. DW's Jonathan Harding This match-was an opportunity-to expel-a hatred that has been bubbling under ever since Leipzig arrived in the Bundesliga. Dortmund fans (and many football fans for that matter)-are rightly aggrieved that this club from the east has bypassed the one rule (50+1 rule) holding the stitches of the German-game together.-But-attacking, spitting or hurling abuse at others just for supporting their team is a world away from feeling wronged by an administrative body. Football violence is not a new phenomena, but the motive for these attacks is. How can it be at all acceptable to harm-someone because you don't like the way their team is run? RB Leipzig have satisfied the yearning of-fans in the east of Germany-for quality, top-flight football. They've created a-new culture - one that quite frankly is preferrable to some of the moronic elements of the one they-met on Saturday. Whether Leipzig have played by-the rules is a different question. German FA (DFB) President Reinhard Grindel has called for a change in the culture of violence in German football. There needs to be an end to the culture of violence, not a change. No one is asking for the emotion of football to be lost, but there is a world of difference between emotional support and physical-rage.\"],\n",

Two German reporters were shocked when they entered the world of the far-right on Facebook via a fake account. What goes on in far-right filter bubbles on Facebook? To find out first-hand, two TV reporters for Germany\\'s ZDF broadcaster created a fake account - 33-year-old \"Hans Mayer,\" a proud German patriot with a clear penchant for right-wing topics. They encountered a world of closed groups, hatred, lies and agitation. \"Mayer,\" the reporters quickly learned, was surrounded by many like-minded men and women in a filter bubble that had little to do with reality and where objections never stood a chance. A filter bubble results from a personalized search and a website\\'s algorithm selecting information a user might want to see, withholding information that disagrees with his or her viewpoints. Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/2VtOa Virtual expedition These filter bubbles are a \"great threat to democracy,\" ZDF reporter Florian Neuhann says. He and his colleague David Gebhard had an idea of what went on in far-right filter bubbles, Neuhann told DW, but were \"totally taken aback by the speed at which their fake account accumulated Facebook friends and the utter absurdity of the stories being spread.\" People in filter bubbles focus their hatred on the same person or phenomenon - like Chancellor Angela Merkel or refugees - and they whip each other into a frenzy to outdo one another with abuse, explains Wolfgang Schweiger, a communication scientist at Hohenheim University. \\'Mayer\\' delved into a parallel society, Neuhann says On day three of the experiment, \"Hans Mayer\\'s\" timeline brimmed with fake news and lurid headlines: stories about government plans to take away the children of right-wing critics, a report stating that the city of Cologne canceled its carnival celebrations for fear of refugees, fake Merkel quotes - all shared thousands of times. The reports often followed a pattern, with an actual source hidden somewhere in the story that had dealt with the issue on hand, however remotely. Worldwide, populists benefit from such activities; their supporters rarely challenge the \"facts\" they are presented. Alarming radicalization Humans, Schweiger says, tend to believe information passed on by those who hold the same or similar views they do. A week into the experiment, \"Mayer\" had many friends on Facebook and was invited into closed groups where users openly urged resisting the system. Forget inhibitions: Interspersed between cute cat photos and pictures of weddings, posts would read \"Shoot the refugees, stand them in front of a wall and take aim,\" while others denied the Holocaust. No one objected. Blind to other people\\'s views By day 12, \"Mayer\" had 250 Facebook friends - real people who never met him in person but felt he shared their beliefs. Neuhann and Gebhard wondered what would happen if \"Mayer\" were to pipe up and disagree. The refugee situation in Germany has led to a rise in outspoken right-wing sentiment So they posted official statistics showing that crime rates have not risen despite the influx of hundreds of thousands of refugees into Germany. To no avail, Neuhann-says: \"We were either ignored or insulted.\"- It\\'s a parallel world, Neuhann says. Part of the bubble is so far gone there is no way reasonable arguments can reach them, he adds, arguing that some people are only partially involved. They still have a life and maybe a job, so they might be approachable, though \"perhaps not as much online as offline.\" Asked whether the reporters are afraid now that their story is out in the open, Neuhann says no, since \"Hans Mayer\" wasn\\'t the fake account\\'s real name. It hasn\\'t been deactivated, but the journalists broke off their experiment after three-weeks. The right-wing-filter bubble continues to exist.'],\n",

The name John Towner Williams may not ring any bells initially, but there\\'s a good chance you\\'ve heard him before. Williams, who celebrates his 85th birthday on February 8, 2017, is one of the most heard composers of our time, having written the soundtracks to the of the biggest blockbusters of the past half-decade.- The New England-born composer and pianist got his start in 1955 as a student at the Juilliard School of Music after serving in the Air Force. After his studies, he moved on to Los Angeles, where he recorded with Henry Mancini throughout the 1960s while composing for some of the most popular television series of the time. His music set the backdrop for paradise-gone-wrong on the series \"Gilligan\\'s Island,\" created the mood in \"Lost in Space,\" and later provided the theme music for the drug-addled antics in 1967\\'s \"Valley of the Dolls,\" for which he received his first Oscar nomination. Inspired by Richard Wagner and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Williams has won-numerous awards throughout his career, becoming-the second-most-nominated person in Academy Award history with 50 Oscar nods. Among his Oscar-award-winning compositions are the scores for the cinematic successes-\"Schindler\\'s List,\" \"E.T.,\" \"Star Wars,\" \"Jaws\" and \"Fiddler on the Roof.\" He likewise holds 22 Grammys, four Golden Globes and seven British Academy Film Awards to his name. Setting movies to music As the theme music to many of the highest-grossing films of all time, Williams\\' scores have helped instill-many film-goers with unforgettable-emotions:-The ominous two-note ostinato from \"Jaws\" still rings in many of our ears when we step into an ocean and a pit of dread forms in our stomachs.- The leitmotifs that run through the-\"Star Wars\"\\' space-epics made the soundtrack one of the highest grossing non-popular music recordings of all time. It\\'s hard to imagine Superman taking flight or Indiana Jones running from a giant boulder without the blast of trumpets. Even Harry Potter\\'s magic wand gains new life when waved to the sounds of Williams\\' compositions.

       " [\"Losses continue to rack GM's Opel Despite intense efforts to turn a profit, Opel has yet to come out of the red. But business for the European automaker's American parent company, General Motors, is booming, with the firm posting record sales worldwide. GM's European subsidiary Opel last year failed once again in its attempt to turn into a profitable entity. GM announced Tuesday that Opel's losses for the full year 2016 stood at around $257 million (239 million euros). The parent company, however, profited from positive conditions in its home market, the United States, which allowed it to boost sales of pickups and SUVs. The Detroit-based automaker was also able to replicate its success across the world, selling a record number of around 10 million vehicles.- The firm's annual revenue, meanwhile, rose nine percent to about $166 billion. Net income, however, fell 2.7 percent to $9.4 billion. GM currently ranks third among global automakers, behind Germany's Volkswagen and Japan's Toyota. While Volkswagen sold 10.3 million vehicles worldwide in 2016, Toyota followed closely with sales of 10.18 million vehicles. Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann has-blamed the British vote to leave the EU and the consequent fall in value of the pound sterling for the company's bad results. Opel would have made a profit if the pound hadn't depreciated the way it did, he said, noting that the carmaker improved its earnings by around $600 million during the previous year. Opel is also planning to launch a number of new models this year, as part of its efforts to reverse its fortunes.

       " [\"UN envoy: 'Inhumane things are happening in Libya' The EU wants better cooperation with North African countries to resolve the migration crisis. Repatriation to Libya is also on the table. But UN special envoy to Libya Martin Kobler says that's a bad idea. Deutsche Welle: The EU is discussing what steps it can take to resolve the migration crisis. One option under consideration is sending migrants back to Libya. What's your view on that? Martin Kobler: Of course, I understand that the Europeans want to stem the flow of migrants from and via Libya, but at this point in time, repatriation to Libya is not a viable solution. There are inhumane things happening here. There are human traffickers at work, there are crimes against humanity. All this has to be stopped. There are international standards, the Geneva Convention has to be respected. And that's why people shouldn't be sent back to face terrible circumstances, such as those in Libyan refugee camps. I think everyone can agree on that. Could you describe the conditions in the camps? They're not like the refugee camps in Jordan, with tents from the UNHCR. The camps in Libya are very crowded, and some people have to sleep standing up or on top of one another, or take turns. Around 10 percent of the male refugees are malnourished. Then there's the problem of disease and abuses by the state. People are being beaten and raped, and some have even been shot. It's completely lawless, there's no order. These are not the kind of circumstances under which you can send refugees back to Libya - that would be completely unacceptable. Again, I understand that the EU and Germany want to limit the number of refugees coming to Europe. But you can't send them back to camps where they will go hungry, be tortured and raped. The fact that neither Germany nor the EU has diplomatic missions in Libya shows how precarious the security situation is there. What has to happen to create the kind of conditions where refugees could be sent back to Libya? Martin Kobler is the UN Special Representative for Libya The solution lies in building up strong state structures. And when Libya is once again a country where there is rule of law and where human rights in the camps can be guaranteed, then we can talk with the government about the possibility of bringing people there. But in the more immediate term, how can we prevent people using Libya as a starting point for their journey to Europe? We need to extend the reach of the coast guard. And we have to improve the humanitarian situation in the camps. And thirdly, we need to increase the number of people who would voluntarily return to their home country. Last year, we sent 3,000 people back to their country of origin. The fourth element lies in improving the situation in the countries of origin, because people don't choose to undertake such a long journey if there is no good reason. Usually, they choose this option if they are subject to political persecution or economic hardship. If the Europeans can work with the countries of origin to improve conditions, then fewer people will make the choice to leave. Libya is considered to be a crisis region. How long will it take before the situation there improves? I don't want to make any predictions about that. The situation here has stabilized somewhat. We have started a political process, but there are no effective state structures. And it's impossible to say how long it will take before there is a proper government in place. Libya has rarely ever had strong state institutions. This is a country that can look back on two generations of the Gadhafi dictatorship - it's hard to get over something like that overnight. Libyans know that, the international community knows that. But we're working hard so that this country which has the largest oil reserves in Africa, no longer needs the support of the international community, and so that the people of this country can enjoy the prosperity that they deserve. Martin Kobler previously served as the German ambassador to Egypt and Iraq. Since November 2015, he has been the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL). UNSMIL recently published a study on the conditions in camps in Libya. Interview by: Nicolas Martin\"],\n",
       " ['Ex-White House ethics lawyer warns Trump to use better judgement in public statements To avoid potential future moves to oust him from office, President Trump should be more careful in what he says, the former chief ethics advisor to President Bush tells DW. He also compares the two Republican presidents. DW: Donald Trump has handed over the management of his businesses to a trust run by his sons. A Trump lawyer also said that the company would not engage in any new foreign deals during Trump\\'s tenure and that new domestic deals would be vetted rigorously by a neutral ethics advisor. What\\'s wrong with that approach? Richard Painter: The president still owns the businesses, which means that all the money that is paid into the businesses is for the financial benefit of the president. And the money that comes from foreign governments, banks controlled by foreign governments or sovereign wealth funds is in violation of the United States Constitution. The Constitution specifically prohibits anyone who holds a position of trust with the United States government, including the president, from receiving economic benefits from foreign governments. So that money from foreign governments and entities controlled by foreign governments is unconstitutional. Other money coming into the Trump business empire from private sources creates serious conflicts of interests. We are very concerned about the president having investments all over the world in places where there could be all sorts of trouble. That is not a good situation for the United States and so we feel strongly that the president needs to divest ownership interest from his businesses. The head of Germany\\'s BGA foreign trade association has said new economic alliances are required to offset the expected negative impact from Donald Trump\\'s protectionist agenda - and keep German exports strong. (07.02.2017) US President Donald Trump has lashed out against a federal judge over legal pushback against his travel ban. Though that is disturbing, the good news is that the system of checks and balances seems to be working. (06.02.2017) A court in San Francisco is to hear the US Justice Department\\'s arguments over whether the entry ban should be restored. The order, which temporarily bars people from seven Muslim-majority states, is currently on hold. (07.02.2017) You along with several other prominent lawyers and the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics (CREW) have sued President Trump under the so called Emoluments Clause, which bars high government officials from receiving gifts or money from a foreign state. You filed the suit a few days after the inauguration. What is the current state of the lawsuit? This is one of dozens of lawsuits against the president in his official capacity because the way in which the president has chosen to run his administration and conduct his business. Our lawsuit asks the judge to look at the foreign government payments coming into the Trump business empire, to look at the Constitution and decide what the president can and what he cannot keep under the Constitution. The suit has been filed and the judge shall decide what the procedures going forward shall be and when decisions will be made. That is out of our control at this point. While many legal experts agree that you may be right on the issue, they argue that you don\\'t have the necessary \"standing\"-to win the case, meaning that you are not personally hurt and affected by the case. How do you counter that? The federal courts in the New York area where we filed the suit have been willing to give standing to organizations such as ours which had to substantially alter their work and their mission and have been affected by the unconstitutional conduct of government officials. There is case law in the second circuit court supporting our positions and we hope that the courts do give standing. Ultimately the Supreme Court may have to rule on that issue. If the courts do not give standing to organizations such as ours, then the courts may end up not deciding this constitutional question at all and the alternative would be for the House of Representatives in two or three years to convene a hearing and investigate and find out what foreign government money the president has received and then think about what action to take. The problem is that this is a very politicized process and will be for sure if the Democrats ever get control of the House of Representatives. It could result in impeachment of the president - a constitutional crisis - and this is something we believe can be avoided if the courts in a much more neutral manner are willing to give us standing and then decide what the president can keep and what he cannot. Former chief White House ethics lawyer Richard Painter Much has been made recently by opponents of the president about the 25th amendment as a possible way to remove Donald Trump from office without impeachment. The amendment allows the removal of a president who is deemed unable \"to discharge the powers and duties of his office\"-temporarily by a majority vote of the vice president and cabinet, but ultimately requires a two-thirds vote in Congress. Do you consider this as a realistic option at all? The 25th amendment is used to deal with a different situation - when the president is incapacitated, not when he is acting illegally. It is designed to deal with a president who is incapacitated due to the president\\'s physical or mental health. At this point, all I would say is that President Trump should use better judgment in his public statements. That\\'s where we are right now. I don\\'t think the evidence is there at this point to say that the president is not physically or mentally capable of carrying out the duties of the president. But I do think he needs to be somewhat more careful and balanced in what he communicates to the public. You served as the chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush. Can you briefly compare how President Bush dealt with ethics questions and how President Trump is handling it? President Bush insisted that he as president set a good example for everyone working in the administration and that he set the right tone at the top. And President Bush, like every other president in recent memory, made absolutely sure that he had no financial conflicts of interests with his official duty. He followed the same rules as everyone in his administration. He did not say that he was somehow special because he was president. He never would have said that the president does not have a conflict of interest unless the president indeed had taken the steps that he took to make absolutely sure that there was no conflict of interest in fact. The president is not above the law and President Bush was adamant about that point. That\\'s one of many respects that President Bush was quite different. He also felt very strongly that our country must welcome people of all religions and races. President Bush right after 9/11 made it very clear that the United States was not in a war with Islam and that we welcome Muslims to our country. We are certainly at war with extremism of any sort and that that is what the war on terror is about. President Bush would never have tolerated any effort to denigrate or discriminate against Muslims in the United States. He recognized that that was un-American and unconstitutional. Richard Painter is a law professor at the University of Minnesota. From 2005 to 2007 he served as the chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush. The interview was conducted by Michael Knigge.'],\n",
       " ['Victims of torture must receive EU visas, court adviser says The European Court of Justice\\'s top adviser said that EU states have to grant entry visas to people at risk of torture or inhuman treatment. Opponents fear this could open up a new route for refugees to get into Europe. Advocate General Paolo Mengozzi said that any EU member state had to provide a visa on humanitarian grounds if-new arrivals were judged to be at risk. The announcement came after Belgian authorities refused to grant humanitarian visas to a family from the besieged city of Aleppo, arguing their links to the city were too tenuous and that they were not obliged to admit everyone coming from a war zone like Syria. \"The Belgian State was not entitled to conclude that it was exempted from its positive obligation under Article 4 of the Charter,\" Mengozzi said, referring to the European Union\\'s rulebook on human rights. Mengozzi\\'s opinion is not binding - however, the advocate general\\'s comments are usually followed by the court, which is due to rule on the case of the Syrian family in the coming weeks. The ruling could affect policy across all EU member states. Daily fines Belgian State Secretary for Migration, Theo Francken, made controversial remarks that may cost the Belgian taxpayer hundreds of thousands of euros Belgian Immigration Minister Theo Francken made a controversial statement about the family from Syria in November 2016, saying that he would rather sell-his office furniture in order to pay-daily fines for defying EU guidelines on admitting refugees instead of honoring a court ruling in favor of the Syrian family. Belgium has been fined 4,000 euros ($4,270) a day for defying a local appeal tribunal in the case. The family is believed still to be in Syria. Many EU states are struggling to process and care for hundreds of thousand of refugees from the Middle East and North Africa, the majority of whom undertake perilous journeys to the EU to apply for asylum on arrival. ss/rt-(AP, Reuters, dpa) Famous for his theory of relativity, German Jewish Nobel Prize laureate Albert Einstein was visiting the US in 1933 when it became clear he could not return to Nazi Germany. He seems to have had mixed feelings about life in exile. He once wrote that he felt \"privileged by fate\" to be living in Princeton, but \"almost ashamed to be living in such peace while all the rest struggle and suffer.\" German singer and actress Marlene Dietrich, she of the husky voice and bedroom eyes, was already a star living in the US, when she acquired American citizenship in 1939 and turned her back on Nazi Germany. A prominent refugee, she spoke out against Hitler and sang for US troops during the war - while her films were banned in Germany. But she said: \"I was born a German and shall always remain one.\" He was a Harvard professor, an authority on international relations, the 56th US Secretary of State, and instrumental in shaping American foreign policy - but in 1938, Bavarian-born Henry Kissinger fled Germany to escape Nazi persecution. Nevertheless Germany, the nonagenarian said in a speech several years ago, \"has never ceased being a part of my life.\" Born in what is now the Czech Republic, Madeleine Albright and her family fled to the US in 1948 when communists took over the government. She got involved in politics and went on to become the highest-ranking woman in the US government: the first female Secretary of State (1997-2001). Born in Vienna in 1919, Lord George Weidenfeld was a British Jewish publisher who immigrated to London in the aftermath of the Nazi annexation of Austria. He co-founded a publishing company, served as chief of staff to Israel\\'s first president, and funded the rescue of Syrian and Iraqi Christians. \"I can\\'t save the world \"?but I had a debt to repay,\" he once said. The 20th century Hungarian composer, virtuoso pianist and folk music collector Bela Bartok was not a Jew, but he was opposed to the rise of Nazism and the persecution of the Jews. In 1940, he moved to the US. \"My main idea, which dominates me entirely, is the brotherhood of man over and above all conflicts,\" Bartok is quoted as saying. Milos Forman, already a leading art-house film director, turned his back on Czechoslovakia and moved to the US after the Prague Spring of 1968. He went on to make two internationally acclaimed Oscar-winning movies: \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo\\'s Nest\" (1975) and the 1984 period drama film \"Amadeus.\" Chilean President Salvador Allende was overthrown in a coup and died in 1973. His cousin\\'s daughter Isabel (who called him uncle) fled to Venezuela after herself receiving death threats. She later settled in the US. Her novels are internationally-acclaimed classics of magical realism, including the \"The House of the Spirits\" and \"Eva Luna.\" Miriam Makeba - lovingly know as Mama Africa - was on tour in the US when the South African government cancelled the young woman\\'s passport for campaigning against the Apartheid regime and later banned her from returning home. Her song \"Pata Pata\" was a worldwide hit in 1967. The legendary singer lived in the US and Guinea before she saw her native country again decades later. Sioux leader Tatanka Iyotake - Sitting Bull - is one of the most famous Native American chiefs in history. Did you know he spent a few years as a refugee? In 1877 he fled to Canada, almost a year after the Battle of the Little Bighorn, also known as Custer\\'s Last Stand. In 1881, he returned to the US, was taken prisoner, and later returned to a reservation.

       " ['\\'Macedonia will only survive as a democratic country\\' The latest elections have failed to put an end to the political crisis in Macedonia. Gudrun Steinacker, former German ambassador to Macedonia, explains what can be done to help the small Balkan country. DW: Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov declined to offer a mandate to form a new government to the main opposition party, the Social Democrats. Previously, the conservative leader and former premier Nikola Gruevski, had failed to form a government. How do you evaluate the president\\'s role in the current political crisis? Gudrun Steinacker: I find it deplorable, because he does not anwer the question what else there is to do and how to overcome the present situation in the country. So the only other solution would probably be new elections, which would mean another few months of total stagnation. That would be an expensive choice for a small country like Macedonia: Organizing elections so often is very difficult. [Editor\\'s note: The last vote in December was held as part of a European Union-brokered deal between Macedonia\\'s main political parties aimed at ending a long-running political crisis. At the elections in December, Gruevski\\'s conservative party VMRO-DPMNE secured 51 seats in the 120-seat parliament - only two more than the Social Democrats.] The Russian Foreign Ministry claimed the West was trying to destabilize Macedonia. \"The goal is obvious - to deal with Macedonian politicians unwelcome-by the West\", it stated at the end of last week. Do you agree with Moscow that conservative leader Gruevski is \\'unwelcome\\' by the West? Gudrun Steinacker, former German ambassador to Macedonia and Montenegro Of course his reputation is severely damaged due to the wiretapping affair, which has not been clarified yet. We have to see what the special prosecutor will finally come up with. We know how often she is being attacked by media organizations close to the-VMRO-DPMNE, which is not acceptable in my view. She should have a chance to do her job. During my time as an ambassador, I did not see that Russia was really playing a constructive and-positive role in Macedonia. And I\\'m a little amazed at the relatively new interest of Russia in Macedonia. I\\'m not sure whether the Russians are really taking into account that this is a fragile, ethnically and religiously very mixed country. I have the feeling that the Russian government is either not aware of this, or that it doesn\\'t take it into account sufficiently. And finally, I don\\'t see what Russia is offering the country and the region. Many politicians in Brussels and Berlin seem to be tired of the Macedonian crisis. Do you see any danger that the EU and Germany, who obviously have to deal with much bigger problems such as Trump\\'s presidency, the Brexit and the refugee crisis, could give up on this small Balkan country and accept any solution that might guarantee its stability - even at the expense of democracy?- It is difficult to predict what is going on in Brussels. There is a-certain fatigue with regard to the crisis in Macedonia and to the situation in the Balkans, particularly regarding EU enlargement: That was even an argument used by Western and German politicians in their dialogue with regional elites, with the message - \\'You have to make more efforts towards reforms\\'. I could imagine that there is a certain fatigue, but on the other hand, I think the crucial people who are dealing with Macedonia are aware that they cannot give up on the country and that they have to stay involved. But there are also different positions in different EU countries and I see a problem for the EU to find a common stance on what to do-and how to do it.- Do you think the EU is doing enough in Macedonia and in the Balkans? As someone who has been involved with the Balkans for so many years, it is my personal view that there is not enough involvement, although we do a lot for the Balkans in particular terms: economic support, support for the reforms etc. But perhaps we should rethink the methods and instruments that we --the EU or Germany-- are using-and adapt them more to the problems of the region so that we can see real progress and not only progress on-paper. What could be the solution for the Macedonian crisis-in your opinion? I think we should ask, in the foreseeable future, for all the claims of wrongdoing and even criminal acts to be investigated.-I would not exclude anyone. And all those who are under investigation should refrain from taking political positions until we know what actually happened. It is still very unclear what happened in many cases. I would like to mention, for example, the case of the young people who were killed in Smilkovci [in 2012]. These are cases that put a strain on relations between the different ethnic groups in the country. Macedonia will only survive as a liberal, democratic country, a homeland for all its citizens, irrespective of their ethnicity or religion.- Gudrun Steinacker was Germany\\'s ambassador to Macedonia from 2011 to 2014.'],\n",
       " ['UK\\'s Kent highlights Brexit division MPs are debating legislation to permit Prime Minister Theresa May to trigger Article 50 and start Britain\\'s exit of the EU. Abigail Frymann Rouch traveled to Kent to find out how much rancor and division still exists. Halfway down a market street in Canterbury sits a van selling Bratwurst. \"Everyone goes mad for German sausage at the Christmas market,\" vendor Geoff Richardson told DW, \"so we thought we\\'d do it all year around.\" Not that a love of Bratwurst equated to political Europhilia. Voters in the historic Kent-city were almost evenly split between those in favor of leaving the European Union (51 percent) and those against (49 percent). Although last June\\'s referendum was a yes-no question, voters addressed a kaleidoscope of issues. The Leave campaign urged people to \"take back control\" on issues such as immigration, borders, over-stretched infrastructure, unpopular directives from Brussels, long-winded bureaucracy, or the cost of EU membership. Reasons cited by remainers - with less passion until it was too late - included regional stability and solidarity, upholding human rights directives, maintaining access to immigrant labor-or financial markets or the fear of the unknown. Many Brits feel their country has bitten off more than it can chew by opting to leave the EU A divided Britain? Dr Chris Moreh, a Research Fellow at the Center for Population Change at the University of Southampton, said the vote had brought to surface divisions that had developed during \"at least the previous decade or so,\" and seemed to have legitimized certain forms of prejudice and hate speech against migrants and judges (who were vilified by the right-wing press for ruling that the government could not trigger Article 50 --declaring the intention to withdraw from the EU --without the authorization of Parliament). \"The UK certainly feels more divided after the Brexit vote [and] any perception of increased division has real social circumstances,\" Dr Moreh told DW. During the public debates on Brexit in the coming years, \"citizens and EU nationals may very well feel that the country is becoming less welcoming, less tolerant of differences in opinion, and overall more divided.\" Indeed, David Isaac, chairman of the state-funded Equality and Human Rights Commission, told MPs last month that he feared a fresh increase in religiously or racially motivated hate crime-against EU citizens in Britain when Article 50 is triggered, as was the case in the two months after the vote. In many cases the Brexit vote split friends and families So just how divided has Britain become? Canterbury in Kent had a high voter turnout (75 percent) and a close-run 51-49 split among Leavers and Remainers. Most people DW spoke to said they had had heated discussions on social media and with friends, family or colleagues about it, but these had passed. Two friends interviewed together, Rory Edwards and Elliot Hawkins, hadn\\'t known that they had voted differently from the other. Richard Board, who voted to leave while his wife voted to remain, said that the referendum had not caused a rift but it had just got people engaging with politics again. Only one interviewee, pro-Leave John Luckie-Downe, who works in corporate finance in Bahrain, said he had lost a friend over Brexit. Some expressed frustration with segments of the electorate. Kevin Burdett, a retired civil servant, had little sympathy for \"youngsters [who] couldn\\'t be bothered to vote\" and were \"moaning\" about the result. Kelly, an administrator who declined to give her surname, said she was \"angry\" with Leavers who only listened to emotive immigration rhetoric. Hamish Dowlen, who works in financial services in the City of London and has clients across the EU, lamented a lack of understanding by some Leavers of the \"crucial relevance of the EU within our complex economy.\" He blamed politicians and schools for failing to communicate the importance of Britain\\'s relationship with the EU. Analysis by the BBC this week found that education levels, then age, were key measures in determining how someone voted. Polls have suggested some Leave voters regret their decision. Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/2RObc Pragmatic approach Among some remainers, pragmatism has replaced disappointment. Charity worker Catherine Parker foresaw advantages to \"getting rid of EU bureaucracy\" while Chris Ball, 19, a drama student disappointed by the falsehoods peddled by the Leave campaign, said: \"Now we just need to get on with it [while] maintaining a stable relationship with the EU --if that is possible.\" Is it possible? The Guardian asked last week, after the publication of the Government\\'s White Paper on Brexit, \"What if there is no deal?\" and quoted a Tory MP as saying \"we have set sail in a very stormy situation.\" Such pessimism was far from the older leavers of Canterbury. \"I don\\'t care if we get a bad trade deal, we can make our own way,\" retired Lynn Fielding told DW, adding \"We like to be Europeans, but outside of Europe.\" Kevin Burdett said he was looking forward to-increased trade with countries such as India and China. Board, a professional landlord in Canterbury facing tax increases from Brussels, told DW he was \"absolutely confident Britain could get a good trade deal --trade barriers were last century; it\\'s essential now for all nations to be able to trade freely, we all recognize that.\" Greg Mayn fears that Britain will be out of its depth in future trade deals However, Greg Mayne, a tax consultant who voted to remain, was less sure, arguing: \"We don\\'t have the expertise to negotiate trade deals, we haven\\'t done so for 40 years.\"-Dowlen, in more apocalyptic language, feared that leaving the EU was tantamount to being herded \"off the economic cliff edge into the abyss.\" Resentment between leavers and remainers could sink back beneath the surface, given that the latter have no Nigel Farage-like figurehead to agitate for them. But the test of cohesion will be seen in the experience of EU nationals and levels of hate crime over the next months and possibly years.'],\n",
       " ['\\'Fall armyworm\\' attacks southern African crops Southern Africa is facing a plague of pests which is threatening crop harvests and food supplies for millions of people. Zimbabwe hosts an emergency FAO meeting next week to shape a coordinated regional response. The fall armyworm is a destructive caterpillar that is indigenous to the Americas, the \\'fall\\' referring to the season during which it tends to migrate to the United States. It was only spotted in Africa last year but has already left a trail of destruction which is threatening food security in many parts of southern Africa. The pest targets maize, sorgum, soya beans, groundnuts and potatoes. Zambia says 124,000 hectares (306,000 acres) of-its crops have been destroyed. In December 2016, the-country ordered the national air force into action to control the plague.- In a statement last week, the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) said \"preliminary reports indicated the possible presence (of the pest) in Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\"- Essential for food security in large parts of Africa, maize is particularly vulnerable to the larvae of the fall armyworm, which attack the crop\\'s growing points and burrow into the cobs.- Jan-Hendrink Venter: \"It\\'s prone to the prevailing winds and can migrate large distances\" South Africa says it is still assessing the damage but three of the country\\'s nine provinces have been hit. Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Senzeni Zokwana said they had positively identified fall armyworm in samples collected in Limpopo province. Zokwana said his department was registering pesticides for use against the fall armyworm as \"no pesticide was previously registered to be used against it.\" He also told local radio on Tuesday he was convinced pesticides would be able to contain the outbreak. Regional response The minister also stressed that South Africa would be taking part in an FAO meeting in Zimbabwe\\'s capital Harare next week to draw up an emergency response to the threat.------------ He said the Department of Agriculture \"realized that trans-boundary pests and diseases, especially migratory pests, threaten food security. Regional efforts are important to address these risks, to ensure that early warnings of these biological threats are in place.\" Countries with confirmed outbreaks can face import bans on their agricultural products-because armyworm is classified as a quarantine pest. A Zimbabwean farmer inspects his crop of maize which has been hit by armyworm Mathew Cock, chief scientist at the UK-based Center for Agriculture and Biosciences International, said outbreaks could cause devastating losses and mounting debts for famers.- The fall armyworm from the Americas is also harder to detect and eradicate than its African counterpart -Jan-Hendrink Venter, a plant scientist with South Africa\\'s Department of Agriculture, told DW-it was-spreading fast. \"We are used to the common African armyworm. This is something new. It has a life cycle of 24 to 40 days. It\\'s prone to the prevailing winds and can migrate very large distances. A rural farmer in Limpopo province, who identified himself as Willi, says he belongs to a group of neighboring farmers who are extremely worried. He\\'s concerned that the government might take care of commercial farmers and \"forget us small farmers in rural areas so we might end up losing the whole crop.\"-------- -'],\n",
       " ['\\'Monument\\' to Aleppo opens to protests in Dresden A peace memorial by Syrian-born artist Manaf Halbouni drawing attention to the parallels between Syria\\'s war and the 1945 bombing of Dresden has been unveiled in Dresden - to loud protests. \"Monument,\" a memorial created by the Syrian-German artist Manaf Halbouni, was unveiled Tuesday in the city of Dresden. Designed to draw attention to the Syrian war while appealing for peace and humanity, the memorial consists of three buses erected on their sides beside the Frauenkirche church in Dresden\\'s central Neumarkt square. Halbouni, who was born in Damascus to a German mother and Syrian father, said the idea behind the public art piece came from a powerful image that was seen worldwide in 2015: Residents of Aleppo put-bombed-out buses on their sides in the heart-of the formerly thriving industrial city to protect themselves from sharpshooters. The buses became a symbol of the resistance movement in the town which, by the end of 2016, had been nearly totally destroyed by war. The 12-meter tall sculpture was installed next to the restored Frauenkirche In Dresden, the sculpture is comprised of three outdated public buses. The artist said he intentionally uses buses that had not been wrecked, as a-symbol-of the peace that can still be found in Germany --unlike in Syria. The Kunsthaus Dresden, a sponsor of the project, said that the artwork creates \"a connection between the people of the Middle East and Europe and our shared destinies\" and symbolizes-\"the suffering and unspeakable losses as well as the hope for reconstruction and peace.\" A symbol of peace and forgiveness The monument was unveiled Tuesday-in an opening ceremony that was loudly protested by members of the right-wing nationalist party AfD and the Pegida movement. Dresden\\'s Mayor-Dirk Hilbert-is under protection due to death threats he received for his approval of the 12-meter-tall (over 39-foot) sculpture. He was loudly booed as he attempted to give a speech celebrating the work. \"The right-wing populists, not only in our city but also across Europe, are building themselves up by forgetting,\" said Hilbert. That\\'s why, he told the crowd at the opening, \"Monument\" is so important. Artist Manaf Halbouni came up with the idea as a memorial to the destroyed city of Aleppo On display in the city through April 3, the installation was funded through donations from the local community. The artist said he-found it important to show that there is a side to Dresden which stands in contrast to the anti-foreigner movement that has become associated with the city. Halbouni, who studied art in Dresden and has had works displayed in London\\'s Victoria and-Albert Museum as well as at the 56th Bienniale in Venice, said the location of the installation is one of great meaning. It was chosen not only because of the artist\\'s connection to the city, but also because of the history of Dresden, which-was completely destroyed in World War II. More than-25,000 people died during-three nights of Allied bombing in February 1945. The restored Frauenkirche serves as a symbol of peace and forgiveness after war. ct/kbm-(AFP, dpa) -'],\n",

Merkel meanwhile called-on Poland\\'s right-wing government to protect the rights-of the political opposition as well as those of the justice system,-trade unions and media, amid an investigation by the EU-Commission-into possible Polish violations of the rule of law. Russia sanctions In separate talks with-Polish Prime-Minister Beata Szydlo, Merkel addressed the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The chancellor later told reporters that-sanctions against Moscow over the ongoing conflict Ukraine-cannot yet be lifted. \"The situation on the ground is still unacceptable,\" she said. Merkel\\'s comments came just hours after a telephone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in which she urged Putin to-use his influence on separatists in eastern Ukraine to bring an end to almost three years of violence. The two agreed, however, on the need for new ceasefire efforts. Angela Merkel and Beata Szydlo stressed the importance of German-Polish ties Poland against Nord Stream 2 Despite being largely on the same page-when it comes to Russia,-the controversial Nord Stream 2-project-remains a contentious issue between Poland and Germany. Reiterating her country\\'s stance on Tuesday,-Szydlo said the Baltic Sea pipeline is \"not acceptable to Poland.\" The-deal would see-Russia\\'s state controlled energy giant Gazprom extend its pipeline to-Germany, bypassing-Poland, the Baltic states and Ukraine.

During the joint press conference,-Szydlo-said Poland is determined to further ties with Germany. \"I am confident that a good partnership between Poland and-Germany is necessary for the success of the European project,\" Szydlo said. \"Poland and Germany ... have a huge role to play in the changes that are taking place in the Union,\" she added. While Poland and Germany both favor-stronger security at EU borders, Merkel said-she was \"cautious about demands for EU treaty change.\" The German chancellor also warned against \"exclusive clubs within the EU.\" Trans-Atlantic relations Two weeks into Donald Trump\\'s presidency in the US, Merkel also addressed comments made by the newly-inaugurated president on Monday in which he said the US \"strongly supports\" NATO. Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/2Wwn1 \"What has been said of NATO by the president and by the-defense and foreign ministers are very important statements and-we will have the opportunity within NATO to meet and to talk-about the future and the challenges,\" Merkel added. Trump\\'s most recent remarks regarding the trans-Atlantic alliance were a far cry from those made prior to his election in which he dismissed NATO as \"obselete,\" sparking concerns that he would seek-to withdraw the US from the alliance. NATO defense ministers are due to meet with-US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis-for the first time next week, and again at the Munich Security Conference a week later. During a phone call last month, Mattis told his German counterpart Ursula von der Leyen that the US was committed to the NATO alliance and US-Germany relations. ksb/rt (Reuters, dpa)'],\n",
       " ['Don\\'t waste it, eat it Why don\\'t we eat crooked cucumbers and knobbly carrots? Because they\\'re hard to find, that\\'s why. Initiatives in Germany and the Czech Republic are encouraging consumers to get more daring with their fruit and veggies. When it comes to culinary delights, our eyes want to feast too, and that also impacts our shopping habits. When we hit the produce department at the local grocer, we always grab the most appealing specimens. This aesthetic expectation leads to food waste and makes us oblivious to mother nature\\'s diversity. \"Supermarkets and grocery chains only offer fruit and vegetables that look uniform,\" explains Anna Strejcov¨¢, spokeswoman and co-founder of the Czech initiative Zachra¨¾ j¨ªdlo (Save the Food). \"Retailers claim that consumers won\"t buy anything else.\" About 20 percent of crops in the Czech Republic, and up to 30 percent in German, are kept from our plates as a result of norms that determine the size, shape and color of fruit and vegetables. \"But since food doesn\"t always grow uniformly, it has to be sorted,\" says Strejcov¨¢. And this sorting often happens right on the fields during harvest time. It wasn\"t originally a question of aesthetics that led to this idealization of cucumbers, apples, and the like, but the fact that uniformly shaped produce takes up less space when stored and transported. Retailers developed internal norms, as did the EU with its often-cited \"bendy cucumber\" directive. But blaming the latter for produce uniformity does not sit well with Amelie Mertin of the German Querfeld initiative. \"What many people don\"t know: the EU \"bendy cucumber\" directive has not been in effect since 2009.\" A flexible leek can become many kinds of dinner. It just needs a chance. It is a vicious circle. Consumers are conditioned to buy straight cucumbers because supermarkets will not stock anything else, which in turn does not allow customers to become (re)accustomed to different shapes and sizes \"?or perhaps they don\"t even remember they exist. \"We must educate the public. Demand it, buy it.\" Amelie Mertin urged. She takes this topic very personally. As a business student, she worked at organic farms during semester breaks and was shocked to hear about the amount of food that goes to waste. \"Many people don\"t even know how much we throw away.\" In Germany alone, roughly 18 million tons of groceries are squandered annually, enough to fill 450,000 transport trucks. Veggies with-character Zachra¨¾ j¨ªdlo is also fed up with the fact that we place greater value on appearance than taste. A campaign called Jsem p?ipraven \"?I am ready \"?aims to put to rest the argument that the customer is not prepared to buy non-standard fruits and vegetables. Almost 10,000 Czech supporters have joined the cause since its inception. Querfeld is a product of the Berlin start-up scene and designed to appeal to the public at large. \"We\\'r not trying to \\'convert\\' anybody or wag our finger at consumers, pressuring them to buy our misshapen vegetables,\" Amelie Mertin explained. \"Instead, our campaigns aim to get people excited about our produce.\" Communication is key, so the campaign must be hip and fun. They appeal to the public with vegetables with character, like tomatoes with noses and the huge variety of root vegetables. \"When we make it fun, we reach a large audience,\" says the young woman who started working for Querfeld\\'s Munich branch in early 2016. ...with a five-headed eggplant. Just a few examples from the Mutato series. The Mutato series consists of thousands of pictures - this is just a small selection. The installation for the World Food Day at the Design-Quartier Ehrenfeld in Cologne (2011). ...also known as a tomato. A collection of different tomato varieties and at the same time the first species of the Cultivar series. An old tomato variety from Greeneville, Tennessee (USA). A tomato variety from the IPK gene bank in Gatersleben found by F. Schwanitz (1957). A beautiful tomato variety found by friends of the photographer in France. Different varieties of the common bean. Author: Klaus Esterluss Zachra¨¾ j¨ªdlo is also playing with the aesthetics of nonconformity. On the Artwall that runs along the bank of Prague\\'s Vltava River, activists have placed photographs by German artist Uli Westphal-that depict oddly-shaped fruits and vegetables, a theme he has been working on since 2006. Westphal\\'s exhibition is supposed to show that \"misshapen\" produce is not only delicious, but also visually unique. \"We are pleased when the consumer thinks it\\'s cool, but that cannot be the extent of it,\" Anna Strejcov¨¢ emphasizes. \"That is why we initiated round table discussions and invited farmers, distributers, experts and representatives from the department of agriculture. We want to tell them which concrete steps can be taken to bring otherwise discarded produce to market.\" All about quality Querfeld has already found one solution: They deliver to business clients such as catering companies and cafeterias who do not care about the appearance of the cucumber before they chop it up. To get to this point, Querfeld had to convince producers and retailers to play along. And that wasn\\'t always easy. Young city-dwellers promoting a start-up was enough to make farmers a little skeptical. \"It was important that our project was not a one-off campaign,\" Amelie Mertin points out. In the meantime, the relationship between Querfeld and producers has grown strong, although the fledging food saving business can\\'t always take everything off the farmers\\' hands. Too big for the shelves, but not for the aspirations of food savers in Germany and the Czech Republic The main priority for both initiatives in Germany and the Czech Republic is to prevent food waste. Regardless of appearance, the quality of the fruit and vegetables must be high. \"It is important to us that the produce be regional and organic,\" Amelie emphasizes. We do not buy and sell old or moldy produce, just food that is optically irregular.\" This reduces food waste, increases profits for farmers, and offers customers an opportunity to get organic produce at great prices.

Since last autumn, the BAMF itself has been cross checking fingerprints with security authorities and was able to \"now rule out multiple identities in the asylum procedure.\" BAMF is also currently dealing with a backlog of some 430,000 unprocessed applications for asylum. Yesterday, a 25-year-old asylum-seeker in Hannover was handed 21 month suspended sentence including 200 hours of community service for fraud, German public-broadcaster NDR reported. He admitted to having registered in several cities across Germany under seven different names in order to obtain social benefits. Earlier in January, the northern German city of Braunschweig opened a special commission to investigate over 300 cases of welfare fraud committed by asylum-seekers. The total fraud is estimated to have cost taxpayers 3 to 5 million euros ($3.2 to $5.3 million) in the state of Lower Saxony. rs/rt-(AFP, KANN, NDR) A total of 722,370 first-time applicants filed requests for political asylum in Germany in 2016, according to the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF). The number reflects a roughly 65 percent increase compared to the previous year, when the total number of new applications stood at 441,899. The number of follow-up applications, however, recorded a decline of 33.3 percent. In 2015, 34,750 second-chance asylum requests were filed with BAMF, whereas in 2016 the number fell to 23,175. Combined, the number of first-time and follow-up applications for 2016 stood at 745,545. In 2015, this number stood at 476,649. So, BAMF recorded a 56.4 percent net increase in the total number of asylum requests in 2016 compared with 2015. The highest number of requests in 2016 were filed by Syrian nationals. According to BAMF\\'s report, people from the war-torn Middle Eastern state submitted 266,250 of the new applications (36.9 percent). Afghan nationals came in second, with 127,012 (17.6 percent), followed by Iraqis, who filed 96,116 asylum requests (13.3 percent) last year. People from Iran filed 26,426 applications (3.7 percent). Eritreans submitted 18,854 applications (2.6 percent). Albanians totaled 14,853 (2.1 percent), 14,484 people from Pakistan requested asylum (2 percent), and Nigerians submitted 12,709 applications (1.8 percent). Nearly three-quarters of the applications filed in 2016 came from people younger than 30 years old. People aged between 18 and 25 filed 196,853 asylum requests, or about 23.5 percent of the overall total, making them the largest age group. The number of applications for children under the age of 4 stood at 78,192 (10.8 percent). German authorities accepted 433,920 people of the 695,733 applications they decided on in 2016. The overall protection rate for all countries of origin amounted to 62.4 percent. Ranging from vandalism to arson, more than 900 attacks on refugee centers were recorded in Germany in 2016. The Federal Criminal Police Office reported that, out of the 921 recorded offenses, 857 were suspected to have had far-right motives.

King Vajiralongkorn, who succeeded his father in 2016, appears keen to continue the controversial convention. David Kaye, the UN\\'s special rapporteur, on Tuesday attacked the case against-Jatupat Boonpatararaksa - a pro-democracy student activist - who was arrested in December for sharing a profile of King Maha Vajiralongkorn on Facebook. \"Public figures, including those exercising the highest political authority, may be subject to criticism, and the fact that some forms of expression are considered to be insulting to a public figure is not sufficient to justify restrictions or penalties,\" Kaye said in a statement. Kaye said such laws \"have no place in a democratic country\" and called for Thailand to repeal them. The chances of that happening are low as the country is run by royalist generals who have formed the most authoritarian government for many years, with political gatherings banned and opponents jailed or facing trial. Use of lese majeste law - making it illegal to defame, insult or threaten the monarch --has leapt since ultra-royalist generals seized power-in 2014. Jatupat Boonpatararaksa - a prominent junta critic better known by his nickname Pai - is the only person to have been prosecuted so far and faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it could not comment on the case against Pai as it was ongoing.

Here\\'s a look back at French singer Juliette Gr¨¦co\\'s impressive 70-year-long career. The Parisian concert hall Olympia was filled with thousands of excited fans in May 2014. They were there for Juliette Gr¨¦co, who was already 87 at the time. Everyone was well aware that it might be their last chance to get to see the artist who has been dubbed \"the high priestess of existentialism.\" The grande dame of French chanson showed up on stage, greeted by thunderous applause. For many, it felt like they were meeting a good old friend again. Youth afflicted by World War II Juliette Gr¨¦co was born on February 7, 1927 in Montpellier-on the French Mediterranean coast. Her father, a police commissioner from Corsica, left the family early on. Her mother moved to Paris with her two daughters and became active in the resistance movement against the German occupiers. Juliette and her sister Charlotte were mainly raised by their grandmother in Bordeaux. In 1943, her mother and sister were arrested by the Gestaspo and were deported to the concentration camp in Ravensbr¨¹ck.-Both survived the ordeal until liberation in 1945. Juliette, too young to be deported, was kept for three weeks in the women\\'s prison Fresnes. Melancholy as a trademark After the end of the war, Juliette started singing in caf¨¦s in Saint-Germain-des-Pr¨¦s. In 1946, she was among the founders of-the cellar club Le Tabou, a famous haunt of French existentialists. Philosopher and novelist Jean-Paul Sartre, film director and actor Orson Welles and Berlin film diva Marlene Dietrich were among the caf¨¦\\'s regulars. Juliette Gr¨¦co was fascinated by the unconventional style and mindset of these new intellectuals. In turn, they were also inspired by the singer. \"Her voice carries millions of poems that haven\\'t been written yet,\" Sartre once said. He felt that she made people aware of the sensual beauty of words. Gr¨¦co became friends with Sartre and painter Bernard Buffet. Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus also wrote lyrics for her songs, describing the post-war generation\\'s hunger for life. Juliette Gr¨¦co with Serge Gainsbourg (right) Gr¨¦co had long black hair at the time and-wore black make-up and black men\\'s trousers. It was her way of demonstrating her affiliation to the existentialists. Her dark voice made her the perfect interpreter of such melancholic songs. She would quickly be celebrated as the \"black muse of Saint-Germain-des-Pr¨¦s.\" \"Black provides space for the imaginary,\" she told the German weekly \"Die Zeit\" in 2015. Multiple lovers Her friendships with poets and intellectuals were more lasting than her love affairs, which she had with both men and women. In her 20s, she had a relationship with jazz musician Miles Davis. \"What do I care what other people think?,\" she\\'d typically answer to anyone who\\'d-ask.- She married three times and-had a daughter with her first husband, actor Philippe Lemaire. Her second husband was actor Michel Piccoli. Since 1988, she has been living with her third husband, pianist and composer G¨¦rard Jouannest. Singer and actress: Juliette Gr¨¦co in London in 1965 \\'The stage is my home\\' Her songs \"Si tu t\\'imagines\" and \"L\\'¨¦ternel f¨¦minin\" became hits at the end of the 1940s. She would also sing some of the chansons of her colleagues, like Jacques Brel or Georges Brassens. She was a celebrated performer in France, Germany, the US and Japan. Gr¨¦co-also obtained film roles, performing for author, filmmaker and painter Jean Cocteau in \"Orpheus\" (1959). Further roles would-follow. To this day, Gr¨¦co feels the words she sings: \"Even if I tell the story of a 16-year-old girl, I believe what I\\'m singing. I am that girl.\" She manages to do that even at an advanced age. It only requires a lot of energy. Building trust in Germany Her first performance in Germany after the war was in 1959. She initially hesitated to go to the country responsible for her family\\'s traumatizing experiences. She sang with tears in her eyes that night; she later said she was thinking about the time her mother and sister spent in Ravensbr¨¹ck. After the hesitant start, she kept returning to Germany. She would perform often in Berlin. In Hamburg, the revue \"Marlene\" combined songs by Marlene Dietrich with her own material. She was a guest of honor at the German Schwetzingen Festival. In 2005, she even released an album in German, \"Abendlied.\" Farewell tour Two years ago, the existentialists\\' muse launched her emotional farewell tour, \"Merci.\" With concerts around the world, she fulfilled the fans\\' expectations, singing hits such as \"D¨¦shabillez-moi,\" \"Sous le ciel de Paris\" and \"Amsterdam\" by Jacques Brel. Her singing was accompanied by the gestures which became her trademark over the nearly 70 years of her career.

       " ['White House lists \\'underreported\\' attacks - including Berlin, Paris, and Orlando The White House has released a list of 78 terror attacks that US President Donald Trump claims have been \"underreported.\" It includes events such as the deadly truck assault at a Berlin Christmas market in December 2016. The White House late on Monday issued a list of terror attacks over a 28-month period from September 2014 to December 2016, with US President Donald Trump saying that media had failed to cover them properly.- The release of the list came after-Trump continued to accuse the media of deliberately manipulating the news, saying that the press had been minimizing coverage of terror attacks and-playing down the threat posed by the so-called \"Islamic State\" (IS). He stated-that the \"very, very dishonest press\" had \"their reasons\" for not reporting what he referred to as a \"genocide\" at the hands of the terrorist group. The list, which - according to the top US political website \"The Hill\" - was made available to journalists, details cities, months, years, targets, and attackers. However, the document-fails to explain why the White House had assessed these events to be underreported, and how they were all supposedly linked to IS. The Washington Post published the actual list online, which is more than 1,600 words long and features 27 instances of the term \"attacker\" misspelled. \"You\\'ve seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe it\\'s happening. It\\'s gotten to a point where it\\'s not even being reported,\" Trump told a group of military leaders during a visit to the US Central Command at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida. \"We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism and we will not allow it to take root in our country. We\\'re not going to allow it.\" Trump\\'s list includes a number of attacks that were covered internationally, including the December 2016 Berlin attack, the June 2016 shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, and a string of attacks in Paris in 2015. The list is seen as an attempt to gather support for Trump\\'s presently frozen executive order imposing a travel ban on seven Muslim countries. Damage control White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer later specified that the president\\'s words were intended to point out that attacks were \"underreported,\"-rather than-\"unreported.\"-Spicer said that the media exaggerated protest while \"an attack or a foiled attack doesn\\'t necessarily get the same coverage.\" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said that \"foiled attacks\" went underreported Spicer offered no advice, however, on how to go about reporting on a \"foiled attack.\" \"Look, I think the president\\'s comments were very clear at the time. He felt as though members of the media don\\'t always cover some of those events to the extent that other events might get covered,\" Spicer said. White House deputy spokeswoman Lindsay Walters added that \"the real point here is that these terrorists\\' attacks are so pervasive at this point that they do not spark the wall-to-wall coverage they once did.\" \"If you look back just a few years ago, any one of these attacks would have been ubiquitous in every news outlet, and now they\\'re happening so often - at a rate of more than once every two weeks, according to the list we sent around - that networks are not devoting to each of them the same level of coverage they once did,\" she said. Reporting on the \\'Bowling Green massacre\\' The White House\\'s claims brought back to mind-recent remarks-by Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, who-said in a recent-interview that news outlets had refused to cover the \"Bowling Green massacre\" - an event which never occurred. Conway later withdrew her comments, saying that she \"misspoke.\" In 2011, two Iraqi citizens had been arrested in Bowling Green, Kentucky, for trying to send funds and arms to terrorist groups in Iraq; however, there was no violent incident involved. Conway, who famously claimed that \"alternative facts\" indicated that more people had attended Trump\\'s inauguration than actually did,-had previously made repeated allegations in interviews-that-a \"Bowling Green massacre\" had been-underreported. ss/tj-(AP, dpa) -'],\n",
       " ['Can tourism protect the Great Barrier Reef? A severe bleaching event last year prompted reports of the Great Barrier Reef\\'s death. But tour operators say much of the reef still thrives, and their boats can help protect it. It\\'s a tranquil afternoon on the Whitsunday Islands at the southern end of Australia\\'s Great Barrier Reef. A tour boat sits moored on a thin slice of white sand as snorkelers marvel at coral beneath crystal clear waters. But the boat\\'s captain, Mike Evans, says these days some visitors have worries on their minds. \"I\\'ve actually had a few people tell me that they\\'ve come to see the reef before it\\'s too late,\" he told DW. \"I tell them that our area\\'s fine but they are having bleaching problems up north.\" Lost treasure? Last year, there were reports of the largest coral die-off ever recorded at the Great Barrier Reef. The reef\\'s northern region lost 67 percent of its shallow-water corals in 2016, prompting some media to claim the reef was \"already dead.\" The damage didn\\'t extend as far south as the Whitsunday Islands. But tour operators in the coastal town of Airlie Beach, where visitors disembark to explore the islands, say more and more people are coming to see the reef before it vanishes. \"I heard that because of the global warming there was degradation of coral reefs,\" Sergi Altadill, visiting from Barcelona, told DW. \"I was thinking this is the moment to come because in a few years there is no more coral reef in this area.\" It isn\\'t just Australia\\'s reefs that are under threat. In December, the United Nations Environment Program published a study showing that with current trends, 99 percent of the world\\'s reefs will suffer severe bleaching annually by the end of this century. Bleaching occurs when the water becomes too warm, causing coral to expel the algae that gives it its vibrant color. The result isn\\'t just a white hue that disappoints divers-- the-coral is also left-vulnerable to starvation and disease. Modeling the reef\\'s future Still, behind the UN study was a development that offers some hope. It drew on new high-resolution projections based on global climate models to-predict when and where coral bleaching will occur. In conducting her research, environmental scientist Karen Joyce enjoys a great overview of marine life in the Great Barrier Reef. This photo shows a panoramic view of Heron Island from the west. The flattened, disk-like bodies of two rays are visible in the lower right of the image. Joyce sets the flying robot on a pre-programmed mission. She operates the drone with a remote control and a computer. Photographs taken by the drone can be downloaded after the mission. This drone view shows the southern part of the Heron Reef flat, and open water out to Wistari Reef. The Great Barrier Reef is a collection of different undersea habitats. The picture above shows corals and algae on Heron Island from about 20 meters (66 feet) up in the air - and looks like a piece of art. A live feed of what the drone sees will be sent back to Joyce\\'s computer - albeit in low resolution. On the left, sharks can be seen swimming in the boat channel on Heron Island. On the right hand side, dense coral is visible. Drone technology offers a great advantage in that it enables Joyce to survey areas that are too difficult or too dangerous to access. This also allows scientists to cover a much larger area than snorkeling or scuba diving would. With the help of drones, scientists are able to get high-resolution information with much greater detail than data provided by satellites. This image shows a highly detailed mosaic of hundreds of individual photos taken by Joyce\\'s drone above Heron Reef. The Great Barrier Reef suffers from massive coral bleaching. With this phenomenon, corals expel symbiotic algae, turn white and eventually die. Climate change-induced warming of seawater is regarded as one of the main reasons for coral bleaching. Research by scientists like Karen Joyce could shed further light on the mechanisms behind the phenomenon. Author: Oleg K?dding-Zurm¨¹hlen Roger Beedon, director of tourism and stewardship at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, says this opens up new possibilities to use data collected by scientists and tour operators. \"Coral reefs are made up of animals, but they behave a bit more like forests because many of them can live for hundreds of years, and they can lock up a record of what has happened to them during that period of time,\" he told DW. \"They\\'re a bit like trees. You can look at growth bands within those corals, and you can see how well they were doing each year.\" This information about the past-can be used to model future developments, and combined with current-observations gathered by tour boats.-That-helps focus protection efforts on areas at-risk,-and has-implications for global conservation efforts. \"One of the important things about reefs is they can give us insights about what\\'s happening at global scale,\" Beedon-says.- Cruise Whitsundays, the largest tour operator in the area, has been participating in a monitoring program called Eye on the Reef since 2007. Tour boats survey the sites they visit regularly and provide data to help manage any impacts they find, including bleaching. Reef outreach Company spokesperson Alyce Carter says the tours also educate visitors about the dangers the reef faces, and dispel exaggerated claims of the reef\\'s \"death.\" \"What\\'s missing in media reports is that the degree the reef is affected varies widely from insignificant to severe,\" she told DW. \"It\\'s the northern section of the Great Barrier Reef that is currently experiencing a major coral bleaching event. That area is approximately 1,590km from our pontoons. People who have lived in this area for more than 20 years have observed that the reef around our pontoons is in the best condition they have ever seen.\" Bleaching happens when algae is expelled from coal, leaving it vulnerable to starvation and disease Not all locals agree. Sandra Williams is a campaigner with the Australian Marine Conservation Society who lives in Airlie Beach. \"I\\'m fortunate enough to have seen the Great Barrier Reef at its most magnificent best,\" she told DW. \"But I also know that people alive now and those coming in the future will never have the opportunity to see what I\\'ve seen on the reef, because it is a very different place even now.\" Williams acknowledges that tour operators in the Whitsundays have upped their reef monitoring activity and educate visitors about environmental threats. Treading lightly- \"Many of the boats that go out daily are actively engaged in reporting changes they see to scientists and government bodies to build up that picture of what is happening locally in the marine environment,\" she says. \"People are very engaged and proactive in looking after their patch, and also in trying to shift government regulation and policy to enact better reef protection.\" But she says this isn\\'t the case with some operators in other parts of the reef. \"They don\\'t want it publicised that the reef is under threat or that there\\'s been coral bleaching-because they see an immediate negative impact on their business.\" And tour boats themselves pose a threat to the reef,-both through engine pollution and by scraping the coral surface. Operators like-Cruise Whitsundays are part of an-eco-certification scheme which means they take-precautions above and beyond what is legally required. Tourists board a Whitsundays cruise boat to see southern parts of the reef, which have seen only minimal bleaching The-Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority also restricts their movements with a complex system of-permitting and zoning, which-actively engages tour operators in a communication loop. The authority uses information their boats-gather-to identify vulnerable areas of the reef and restrict activity there. Extreme weather Minimizing damage from tourism is vital given the threat-from climate change. And with extreme weather events happening more frequently, this-is not limited to bleaching. Right now, one of the main concerns for-those protecting the reef is ensuring corals are in the best possible health if and when a cyclone hits. \"We\\'re now in the middle of our summer period - this is traditionally our cyclone season,\" says Williams. \"For first time in three years we\\'re actually having a wet season, and I expect somewhere at least once in the coming months, somewhere on the coast, there will be a massive cyclone.\" Williams says if a cyclone hit a northern area like Port Douglas, where two thirds of the coral is already dead,-the impact on what remains-could be devastating.- \"It doesn\\'t have the resilience to fight back from that.\" -'],\n",

Now they need their reboot of the family craft to thrive, reports Richard Orange from Malm?. Mohannad Sabbagh deftly whips a copper scoop into the rotating cauldron in front of him, pulling it out loaded with hot salt. \"My body is a thermometer!\" he grins as he dabs his palm lightly on the surface. \"My hand is what measures the temperature.\" Sabbagh, 20, has been roasting cashews, pistachios, chick peas, and melon seeds in exactly this way ever since his father sent him out aged 12 to work at the family roastery near Bab Touma gate in Damascus\\'s old city.- The cauldron, heated by a dull diesel flame, is not so different from the one his great-grandfather used back in 1913 when he launched his roastery, a Damascus institution that is still going strong today. Some Syrian refugees in Germany have made arrangements to return home voluntarily. DW has spoken to a few of these refugees about the challenges they face. (27.01.2017) Vienna\\'s Habibi & Hawara restaurant employs a dozen mainly Syrian refugees. But it\\'s not just a job: The goal is to teach newcomers how to run a company in Austria, reports Matteo Tacconi. (22.10.2016) The challenge of integrating large numbers of refugees from the Middle East is nothing new for Sweden. A dozen years ago, the country opened its doors to Iraqis - with mixed results. Richard Orange reports from Malm?. (21.10.2015) But we are not in Syria. We are in a drab industrial estate on a cold, wet January morning in Malm?, the city in Sweden to which Sabbagh and his brother Moumen fled in December and October 2015 respectively, during the last wave of Europe\\'s refugee crisis. Together with their old Damascus neighbors Jehad and Mamoun Abo Rokba, the brothers hope to bring a taste of home to the 112,000 Syrians who have fled to Sweden since civil war began five years ago.- \"The Syrians love it! It\\'s like their dream shop has opened,\" Sabbagh says of Delicious Rosteri, which opened three weeks ago in M?llevaangen Square, the center of the city\\'s immigrant population, with a dabka folk dance-featuring bagpipes and tambourines.- Lavishly decorated with gold cladding, the shop sells more than 90 varieties of nuts from its wooden drawers.- \"Whoever knows it from Damascus, they will come on the basis of the name. The flavor is known, it\\'s like a franchise, like IKEA,\" Sabbagh-jokes. - The brothers also hope to serve the rest of the city\\'s Arab population, and even lure in the occasional Swede. Spurred on by suffering Back at the factory, Sabbagh-pokes his nose over the cauldron and smells the now half-roasted chickpeas, an expression of exaggerated delight spreading over his face.- \"It\\'s not the flame that roasts the nuts, it\\'s the hot salt,\" he explains enthusiastically, \"because the seeds will burn if exposed to raw flame or hot metal.\"- The roasting machine, the four spinning barrels used to flavor the nuts, the copper scoop, even the rubber baskets made from old car tires, everything has been shipped from Syria by his father.- Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/2TFIN \"All of the ways of making this roastery are \\'old-school,\\' because we want the old taste to stay,\" he says. \"We did consider new roasting techniques, but it lacks the flavor. We want it to taste the way it tasted 50 years ago.\"- Once roasted, the nuts must be sold quickly to retain their flavor and nutritional value. Nuts which have sat in storage for months after being imported from Iraq or Egypt quickly absorb moisture and grow a patina of mould.- It hasn\\'t been easy. Sabbagh whistles and looks theatrically at the ceiling when asked about his month-long journey from Turkey, which began when the boat he joined to cross over to Greece began to sink into the cold December waters of the Aegean.- He was rescued, and then arrested, before making the long overland journey to Sweden, all the time fearing that by the time he got here, the rules would have changed to prevent him from being able to stay.- \"But if it wasn\\'t for this suffering we wouldn\\'t have such motivation to start a business like this,\" he smiles. \"It makes us appreciate it more.\" The brothers and their partners are in a hurry. They rented premises and imported the machines within months of arriving in the city, only to discover that Sweden\\'s authorities didn\\'t look too kindly on burning diesel with an open flame in an enclosed space.- Getting a license took a frustrating eight months and required installing an expensive ventilation system.- When they went to Almi, a Swedish government bank which funds and advises immigrants starting small businesses, they were advised to give up. \"They said \\'your project isn\\'t going to work,\\'\" shrugs Mamoun Abo Rokba, who worked as a lawyer in Syria before fleeing three years ago, and now handles the business side.\"So I went straight back to the workshop and started to make it happen.\" Local tensions What Abo Rokba and the al-Sabbagh brothers have going for them is the backing of their prosperous Damascus families: The Sabbagh family owns five roasteries, while Abo Rokba\\'s father runs a company importing medical equipment. This is not unusual for Syrians in Sweden, who are often richer and better educated than the Iraqis who came in the wake of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. - The family behind the-Jasmin al-Sham restaurant which opened in the middle of the city\\'s main pedestrian street last April owned four paper tissue factories in the Syrian city of Homs. They spent hundreds of thousands of euros converting an old branch of Pizza Hut into a replica of a Damascene house. But the perceived arrogance with which Malm?\\'s newly arrived Syrians splash money around, and the attention-seeking dabka dances they arrange to launch new businesses, generate not a little resentment among established Arabs. - \"There is that sentiment,\" admits Abo Rokba. \"You can feel it. They\\'re not happy with whatever you started. People tend to forget that we didn\\'t come here by choice. We were forced to leave Syria.\"- Mohannad Sabbagh and his brother are carrying on a family tradition with Delicious Rosteri But Syrians like him aren\\'t willing to spend years living on benefits while they study Svenksa f?r Invandrare (SFI, Swedish for immigrants), the slow-moving language program which is the official first step to integration in Sweden.- \"Syrians don\\'t like to stay at home and wait for things to happen,\" he says. \"SFI doesn\\'t get you a job. We don\\'t want to be a burden, we want to be an active part of society.\"- Abo Rokba-has just come back from a business meeting in Austria where he discussed exporting his freshly roasted nuts. He has plans to set up another roastery in Berlin. He is thinking of adding freshly roasted Arabic coffee to the product line. Back at the factory, Sabbagh inserts a metal bucket into the cauldron and chickpeas and salt begin to cascade down a ramp, the chickpeas into rubber baskets, and the salt falling through holes to floor to be used again.- He scoops up a handful of the hot nuts and pours them into my hand.- \"You will taste the flavor of Sham now,\" he exclaims. \"A taste of old Syria!\"'],\n",
       " ['Safer Internet Day: It\\'s down to you, me, kids and parents to protect ourselves online The annual Safer Internet Day is all about kids and how to protect them online. But it\\'s about all of us, really. Parents need to know how to help their kids, and sometimes the kids can help the \"olds.\" What are the threats for kids online? Official advice on internet safety tends to focus on a few main threats. In late 2015, the UK government published measures to keep children safe online at school and at home. It includes \"cyber bullying, pornography and the risk of radicalization\" as major threats. It refers to \"some school children, who travelled or attempted to travel to Syria, were able to access material about Daesh [\"Islamic State\" or ISIS] and foreign fighters via school computers.\" In September 2016, the German government advice listed the same basic threats, but replaced radicalization with the risk of \"gruesome, violent imagery.\" And it\\'s all true, but a bit vague, to be honest. The United States Department of Justice (DOJ), however, dives right into the detail: \"Children may come into contact with demeaning, racist, sexist, violent, hateful or false information.\" The advice is dated October 24, 2016, so it can be safely assumed the reference to hateful and false information has nothing to do with President Donald Trump (or his administration\\'s tampering of government websites). It then skips over pornography, SPAM containing obscene material, and \"file swapping programs with inappropriate and sometimes mislabeled content,\" before stating that \"most worrisome, children may encounter actual predators that use the internet to identify and lure victims through chat rooms, instant messaging facilities, and social networking sites.\" So what can kids and parents do to surf the net safely? Well, the DOJ says that due to \"first amendment rights to free speech, various types of information can be posted in the web, some of which a parent may find inappropriate for their child(ren) to view.\" It then goes on to recommend parents snoop on their kids, which, on one level, counters that very idea of free speech. But we are talking about protecting kids, so perhaps snooping is the only way, certainly when kids hit those secretive teen years. While you mull that over,, let me give you more from the DOJ. It\\'ll help you decide. Â° Do not post personal information online or your picture - \"it can be copied, changed or used to find you.\" Â° Do not post your plans and activities in a chat room. Do not post entries that make it clear no one is at your home. And do not use location services - they reveal your location in real-time. Â° Do not communicate with people who make you feel uncomfortable or afraid. This, no doubt, is meant to help you steer clear of cyber bullies. But bullies are predators, and sometimes simply walking away isn\\'t enough. So what do you do then? Find someone you trust, like your parents or a teacher. Parents, says the DOJ, should ensure their kids\\' computers are in a public space even in the home. This neatly ignores concealed messaging on smartphones and watches, but you get the idea. It\\'s also suggested you know your kids\\' passwords and read through their emails regularly - perhaps also follow them on social media. This is understandable up to a point, but it could have devastating effects on trust within your family. And when that trust is bust, who do you think your kids will turn to? So try talking to your kids before spying on them. And kids, how about you share with your parents before they feel the urge to track you like a troll? For instance, if you come across images that upset you online, talk to your parents. They may not have all the answers, but it\\'ll be better than keeping it secret. - Amanda Todd, a 15-year-old and cyber bullying victim, called for help in a YouTube video before committing suicide You should also talk to your parents before buying apps or in-app purchases and before joining online groups and games. Involve them, and seek their advice - it\\'s no reason to be ashamed. Oh, and speaking of shame: Try to avoid sexting. It\\'ll only come back to bite you in the \"?or send you head first into a case of revenge porn. Not good. Don\\'t internet companies bear responsibility? Yes, companies should bear responsibility, and some do. Take the UK Council for Child Internet Safety. It\\'s worked with internet service providers and telcos, like BT and Everything Everywhere, as well as social media companies like Facebook and the makers of the massively multiplayer online game (MMO) and virtual world, Club Penguin, to produce a set of universal guidelines. It\\'s advice on \"effective internet safety messages\" for providers. Granted, it\\'s just words, mere talk, where engagement is what\\'s needed. But talk is often a first step. The very same information is aimed at schools. This is vital, as increasingly education is done directly on networked, mobile devices. Teachers are on the frontline. There\\'s also Google\\'s Internet Legends, which goes on tour to \"educate primary school children on online safety.\"-Its-Safety Centre gives advice on managing your \"online reputation.\" It says make smart connections and, on cyber bullying (or \"cybermobbing\" as it\\'s called in Germany), it encourages you to \"be an upstander, not a bystander.\" And this is all well and good. But quite often parents - those people who are closest to you kids - are not the most internet-savvy people. So, sometimes internet safety has to be built in. The German government points to two child-safe search engines: fragFinn.de, which may require extra child-protection software, and blinde-kuh.de. And klicksafe.de is an EU-driven portal with loads of information on safety online. Or obfuscate\"?For advanced users among us, refraining from posting personal information is just the start. Some people protect themselves online through direct action. As Finn Brunton and Helen Nissenbaum write in \"Obfuscation,\" there are ways to spray false, meaningless information to hide yourself in the noise, or disrupt another conversation. There are ethical issues at stake, possibly even legal ones - obfuscation can be used for good and bad. So it\\'s to be deployed with care. Check out a Safer Internet Day 2017 action near you.'],\n",

The legislation promises to compensate Palestinian owners with cash or other land. Israel has played down comments from the White House cautioning that new settlement building \"may not be helpful\" to the peace process. Israelis still expect US President Donald Trump to be more pro-Israel than Obama. (03.02.2017) Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has said he will build the first new West Bank settlement in over 20 years. Meanwhile, the Trump administration in the US pushed back against further settlements. (03.02.2017) Under a court order, Israeli security forces have begun to evacuate the unauthorized Amona settlement, despite resistance from residents. Hours earlier, the government unveiled plans for 3,000 new settlement homes. (01.02.2017) The law, which passed by a vote of 60 to 52 on Monday night, retroactively legalized about 4,000 settler homes built on privately-owned Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank. The legislation applies to 53 outposts and homes within existing settlements, according to the anti-settlement organization Peace Now. But analysts said its passage may only be largely symbolic as it contravenes Israeli Supreme Court rulings on property rights. Israel\\'s attorney-general has warned the law is unconstitutional and that he will not defend it in-the country\\'s top court. Palestinians furious In response to Monday\\'s vote, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) slammed the new law as-a means to \"legalize theft\" and demonstrated \"the Israeli government\\'s will to destroy any chances for a political solution.\" Under international law, the Israeli settlements are illegal and are seen by most countries as an obstacle to the peace process. But Israel disputes this and cites biblical, historical and political connections to the land, as well as security needs. A PLO statement stressed that the \"Israeli settlement enterprise negates peace and the possibility of the two-state solution.\" Ahead of the vote, opposition chief and Labour leader Isaac Herzog lashed out against the \"despicable law\" that he said would undermine the country\\'s Jewish majority. Israeli ministers divided The legislation has raised tensions in the government, with political sources telling news agencies that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu privately opposes the bill. He believes it could provide grounds for prosecution by the International Criminal Court in The Hague.

Most black holes only require one year to eat stars. University of New Hampshire scientist Dacheng Lin and his team noted a black hole has been eating at a star-since July 2005 and is still going. This is the longest known event of a star being devoured by a black hole. \"We have witnessed a star\\'s spectacular and prolonged demise,\" said Lin in a statement. \"Dozens of tidal disruption events have been detected since the 1990\\'s, but none that remained bright for nearly as long as this one.\" The observation was noted Monday in the Nature Astronomy journal. The astronomic event is taking place in a host galaxy 1.8 billion light years away. According to the Chandra X-ray Observatory, NASA\\'s flagship telescope for detecting x-rays around the universe, the black hole, also known as XJ1500+0154, is located in the center of the host galaxy, the expected location for a supermassive black hole. Supermassive black holes are found at the centers of almost all large galaxies in the observable universe. The XJ1500+0154 black hole emitted its greatest x-ray brightness in June 2008, and has since reduced in brightness. The data also indicates the radiation surrounding the black hole has surpassed the so-called Eddington limit, a balance between the outgoing pressure of radiation from hot gas and the inward gravitational pull of the black hole. The limit explains the luminosity of black holes. \"For most of the time we\\'ve been looking at this object, it has been growing rapidly.

Between 5,000 and 13,000 people were executed in the Syrian military prison at Saydnaya between 2011 and 2015, according to a report published on Tuesday by rights group Amnesty International (AI). The majority of the victims were civilians who had denounced the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Amnesty said. The report, entitled \" Human slaughterhouse: Mass hangings and extermination at Saydnaya prison, Syria\" was corroborated with 84 witness and expert accounts, including prison guards, former prisoners, judges and lawyers. \"Between 2011 and 2015, Saydnaya saw mass executions that came to total around 50 people per week,\" AI\\'s General Secretary in Germany, Markus N. Beeko, said, The executions were reportedly authorized by the Syrian government, with military tribunals taking just minutes-before prisoners-were sentenced to death. Thousands more people are-reported to have died through torture and inhumane treatment. \"These major systematic violations in human rights mean that we are dealing with cases of crimes against humanity,\" Beeko said. \"These crimes cannot go unpunished; they must be referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC).\" If this route is blocked by the UN Security Council, then individual member states should do all they can to make sure that these crimes are answered for, Beeko added. Syria has been rocked by bloody civil war since 2011, which has seen more than 310,000 people killed and millions more displaced. dm/jm-(AFP, dpa) In 2011, as regimes crumble across the region, tens of thousands of Syrians take to the streets to protest against corruption, high unemployment and soaring food prices. The Syrian government responds with live ammunition, claiming some 400 lives by May. At the urging of Western countries, the UN Security Council condemns the violent crackdown. The EU and US implement an arms embargo, visa bans and asset freezes in the months that follow. With the backing of the Arab League, calls eventually grow for the Syrian president\\'s departure. But not all UN members agree with this demand. Bashar al-Assad - who has been in power since the death of his father in 2000 - sees his reputation wane with the continuing unrest. He refuses to end decades-long emergency rule, which allows for surveillance and interrogation. Russia backs its ally, supplying weapons and vetoing UN resolutions on Syria multiple times. By the end of the year, human rights groups and the UN have evidence of human rights abuses. Civilians and military deserters are slowly beginning to organize themselves to fight back against government forces, which have been targeting dissidents. More than 5,000 have died so far in the fighting. It will take another six months before the UN acknowledges that a war is taking place on Syrian soil. In September 2012, Iran confirms that it has fighters on the ground in Syria - a fact long denied by Damascus. The presence of allied troops underscores the hesitance of the US and other Western powers to intervene in the conflict. The US, stung by failed interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq, sees dialogue as the only reasonable solution. As the death toll nears 100,000, the number of refugees in neighboring countries - such as Turkey and Jordan - hits one million. That number will double by September 2013. The West and the Arab League have seen all attempts at a transitional government fail in the two years of war, watching as fighting spills over into Turkey and Lebanon. They fear Assad will stay in power by any means possible. Assad has long claimed he\\'s combatting terrorists. But it\\'s not until the second year of war that the fragmented Free Syrian Army is definitely known to include radical extremists. The group Al-Nusra Front pledges allegiance to al Qaeda, further splintering the opposition. In June 2013, the White House says it has evidence that Assad has been using sarin nerve gas on civilians - a report later backed by the UN. The discovery pushes US President Barack Obama and other Western leaders toward considering the use of military force. However, Russia\\'s proposal to remove the chemical weapons ultimately wins out. Reports of a new jihadist group calling itself the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) emerge in the final weeks of 2013. Taking land in northern Syria and Iraq, the group sparks infighting among the opposition, with some 500 dead by early 2014. The unexpected emergence of IS ultimately draws the US, France, Saudi Arabia and other nations into the war. Author: Kathleen Schuster'],\n",
       " ['Foreign Minister Gabriel plays down Libya as safe place to return refugees At the EU foreign ministers meeting, Germany\\'s Sigmar Gabriel played down proposals to return migrants to Libya. Ministers are pushing the Libyan government to do more to halt an influx of refugees to Europe. The chairman of the Social Democrats (SPD) has said a comprehensive approach to the migrant crisis had to involve the return of refugees to North Africa. His words echoed sentiments made by Germany\\'s interior minister. (05.02.2017) More migrants attempting to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean have been taken aboard rescue ships, aid organizations said. The rescues come as EU leaders adopt controversial measures in cooperation with Libya. (04.02.2017) A plan to keep migrants from crossing the Mediterranean Sea has been agreed on by EU leaders at their Malta summit. Rights groups warn the policy will confine asylum-seekers to inhumane conditions in Libya. (03.02.2017) The Libyan camps where traffickers hold would-be migrants resemble concentration camps, German diplomats say. Their report comes as the EU mulls a migration deal with the North African country. (29.01.2017) Gabriel, who is Germany\\'s Foreign Minister and also Vice Chancellor, was skeptical about deporting migrants from Italy, where over the past year most migrants have landed in Europe, back to Libya because of the country\\'s chaotic political situation. \"We believe Libya is a very unstable place,\" he told reporters on Monday while in Brussels for-talks with his European counterparts, to implement a deal thrashed out last week by EU leaders in Malta. Gabriel\\'s comments contradicted those made by another senior member of his Social Democrats (SPD),-Thomas Oppermann, who heads the-party\\'s parliamentary group. Oppermann had argued in the-Sunday edition of the German newspaper \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung,\"-that if migrants were returned to Libya, it-would help-curb human trafficking. Ten-point plan On Friday, EU states agreed a 10-point program to assist Libya to reduce the migrant flow, including funding and training for the Libyan coastguard. Leaders also vowed to help set up safe refugee camps in the North African country, after human rights groups criticized existing camps for their inhumane conditions. The bloc will also increase support for those who voluntarily return home from Libya, an EU statement said. Germany Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel met his EU counterparts for the first time since taking up the job last month Ministers also urged Libyan authorities to step up efforts to protect migrants, especially those held in detention centers. They condemned reports of migrant abuse by people smugglers, and called \"on all parties to ensure unhindered and secure access to the centers for aid workers.\" \\'Send them back\\' Austria\\'s Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz said the bloc needed to learn from the Australian example, which until recently turned away refugees arriving by boat. The \"most important rule\" had to be that if anyone set off illegally towards the EU, they would be sent back at the bloc\\'s external borders. Some 180,000 refugees, most of them from Libya, landed in Italy last year. Over the weekend, some 1,500 migrants were rescued after their rickety boats got into trouble, the Italian coastguard said. Italian and Spanish rescue teams launched nine different operations to pick up the migrants from vessels in the central Mediterranean off Libya. Last week, Libya said it had intercepted more than 1,100 migrants on inflatable and wooden boats off its coast.

       " [\"Berlin police launch test phase of divisive Taser-guns Berlin's police department has started to explore the use of so-called Tasers. The controversial weapons were previously only allowed for use by special units. Police, journalists and onlookers were scattered around the damaged Christmas market the day after the terrorist attack. DW's Ben Knight joined them. (20.12.2016) The German government has endorsed a package of security bills, including broadening video surveillance and allowing federal police to wear bodycams. The draft was in the works months before the deadly Berlin attacks. (21.12.2016) The head of Germany's intelligence agency has said authorities received a tip in September that 'IS' was planning an attack. Bomb plot suspect, Jaber A., was detained after police found explosives in his apartment. (11.10.2016) Bristol police used the stun gun after mistaking the man for a wanted criminal suspect. Video footage showed him refusing to give his name to police outside his home. (20.01.2017) Police officers in Berlin will run a three-year test phase of using Taser-guns in threatening-situations. The city-state will be the first in Germany to roll out a trial phase of the divisive weapons, which until now-were only available to special police units and federal police forces in charge of domestic security issues. Units in the districts of Mitte and Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg have provided training to 20 officers on how to employ Tasers in dangerous situations. Further officers are expected to receive the same training in due course. The German capital is on high alert following a terror attack in December 2016, in which a truck was used to kill 12 people attending a Christmas market. The city is planning to introduce other-measures as part of a comprehensive overhaul of its security setup, including increased video surveillance. Shoot on sight? The use of firearms will continue-to be allowed alongside Tasers.-However, authorities hope that the roll-out of Tasers will reduce the use of guns, offering this technology as part of non-lethal alternatives such as pepper spray and tear gas to combat attacks. Technically, however, Taser-guns remain subject to state laws governing the use of firearms by police.- A similar pilot project is reportedly planned for the federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate, starting in March 2017. The state of Hesse is also considering the use of Tasers. The contentious weapons are intended to give Berlin police officers more choice in how to react when facing danger A deadly weapon Tasers, also known as stun guns, deliver a powerful and painful electric shock, rendering an attacker unable to move for a number of seconds. The modern weapons are intended to allow police officers to use this time to apprehend a suspect without sustaining injury themselves. Tasers have, however, come in for criticism-for causing the deaths of a number of people, including-former Aston Villa footballer Dalian Atkinson in the UK last year - one of eleven deaths linked to the use of Tasers by the police in the UK alone. London police are-currently examining whether officers-wish to expand the use of a potentially deadly weapon in the face of the ongoing threat of terror across Europe. ss/rt-(dpa, epd, AFP)\"],\n",
       " ['Maastricht Treaty - not yet set in stone It\\'s been 25 years since the signing of the Maastricht Treaty, which among other things included provisions that have to be met to join the euro. After all these years, however, they have proved to be mere paper tigers. The two most important elements of these provisions - known as the convergence criteria - concern fiscal discipline, mandating member states to limit their annual budget deficits to less than three percent of their respective economic output while instructing them to hold their national debt to under 60 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Germany was the driving force behind the inclusion of these provisions in the agreement, even though the \"three-percent rule\" on budget deficits had originally been conceived by a young French official. Guy Abeille, a low-ranking employee in the French finance ministry, was tasked in 1982 to come up with a way to control the problem of runaway fiscal deficits, a product of then French President Francois Mitterrand\\'s expansive spending policies. The French government\\'s budget deficit at the time roughly amounted to 2.6 percent of GDP. Abeille therefore was of the view that a one percent ceiling on the deficit would be unrealistic; even adhering to a two percent ceiling would be an onerous task for the government. That\\'s why he suggested a three percent upper limit, and the simple and arbitrary manner in which the rule came into being. It was then later incorporated into the Maastricht Treaty as an important criterion that has to be met by potential member states to join the European monetary union. The rule on keeping the level of national debt below 60 percent of GDP was arbitrary, says Oliver Sivering Arbitrary decisions Even the rule on keeping the level of national debt below 60 percent of GDP was arbitrary, says Oliver Sievering of the College of Public Administration and Finance in the southern German city of Ludwigsburg. In the early 1990s, many countries\\' debt levels were around 60 percent of GDP. The two figures were then intertwined to come up with the debt and deficit rules, Sievering told DW. \"If the economy grows nominally by five percent, the new debt may rise by three percent. And this was used as the basis for coming up with an upper limit on debt of 60 percent of GDP.\" But it quickly became clear that achieving an annual growth rate of five percent was far from realistic. It was also evident that countries like Belgium, Italy and Greece wouldn\\'t be able to meet the 60 percent target. As a result, one had to just take comfort from the fact that the debt situation of these countries was moving in a positive direction and focus on the three-percent-deficit target.- A convergence report published in 1998 by the European Monetary Institute shows that except for Greece, all other potential eurozone candidates showed a fiscal deficit of less than three percent of GDP. Fresh eurozone economic data show that inflation has risen to just below the ECB\\'s key target, growth is accelerating and unemployment has hit a seven-year low, suggesting the bloc\\'s economy is finally on the mend. (31.01.2017) An adviser to President Trump says the euro served as a currency for Germany alone, allowing it to \"exploit\" its EU partners and the US. Is it worthwhile to confront this nonsense with facts? asks DW\\'s Rolf Wenkel. (02.02.2017) A poll by an investment consultancy has shown that more investors than ever consider a breakup of the eurozone likely in the next 12 months. Italy\\'s woes are in focus, but it\\'s not the only potential trouble spot. (29.11.2016) Hans Tietmeyer held a major leadership role in two of Germany\\'s most important transitions in recent memory: Reunification and the introduction of the euro currency. His passing has been confirmed by the central bank. (28.12.2016) Some countries, including Germany, resorted to a number of tricks to show that they complied with the requirement. For instance, the German government sold shares in firms like Deutsche Telekom and Deutsche Post to the state-owned development bank KfW, in a bid to show that it reduced its debt level. Italy, meanwhile, introduced a European tax on its citizens only to repay most of it after the introduction of the euro. Not a good example The two Maastricht criteria are meant to be respected even after entering the eurozone club, to guarantee the solidity of the currency and the monetary area. Germany, in particular, has always insisted on their compliance. However, Europe\\'s largest economy, together with France, violated the deficit limit in 2002, and yet both Berlin and Paris managed to avoid paying billions in fines and softened the strict rules. \"Since then, it has been quite detrimental to budgetary discipline in the euro area, as it gave a chance to other countries to say: if Germany and France do not adhere to the criteria, why should we stick to them?\" noted Sievering. At the height of the financial crisis, almost all countries exceeded the budget deficit target.- Although most eurozone countries have managed to rein in their deficits, they still have a long way to go when it comes to their debt. In 2015, for example, it was only Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Luxembourg whose debts were below the 60 percent threshold. While Germany recorded a budget surplus again in 2016, its national debt was hovering around 70 percent of GDP, way above the prescribed limit. Although the Maastricht criteria have been violated innumerable times, no penalty has so far been imposed on any violator. \"No one wants to impose a fine on the other, because every country knows that in a few years it could face a similar situation and would be glad if it were let off the hook,\" underlined Sievering. In other words, potential perpetrators judge current culprits. Despite the ineffectiveness of the compliance mechanism, Sievering views the rules as indispensable. He points out that just paying attention to the criteria and discussing-them has-a disciplining effect. -'],\n",
       " ['Interview: Oppermann\\'s refugee stance not SPD\\'s official position Thomas Oppermann, chairman of the Social Democrats in Germany\\'s parliament, wants refugees rescued from the Mediterranean sent back to Africa. Fellow SPD lawmaker Aziz Bozkurt tells DW that is bad policy. DW: Mr. Bozkurt, your party colleague and Social Democrats (SPD) boss Thomas Oppermann wants refugees who are pulled out of the Mediterranean-returned to North Africa as a way of stopping trafficking. What is wrong with this plan? Aziz Bozkurt: This is, at the very least, legally questionable. It is a fundamental principal of international law not to send back those whose lives and freedom are in danger. Under international law, you can\\'t pull people out of the Mediterranean and then return them to unstable countries. What Oppermann is suggesting is neither realistic nor doable, same as other Social Democrats have said. It has been suggested before and, like spoiled milk, the idea does not get better with time. Oppermann said that refugees should receive \"initial care in North Africa.\" That sounds like asylum requests can be reviewed there. It is fine to find legal paths. However, we have to see which countries we\\'re dealing with. Libya, for example, is more than unstable, as Foreign Minister [Sigmar] Gabriel said again today. Then there are countries like Morocco or Tunisia. Conditions there are basic, yet even there we cannot guarantee legal procedures will be carried out to our standards. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere plans to establish a reception center in Tunisia. What is wrong with checking asylum cases there? The SPD\\'s Aziz Bozkurt It\\'s that those people are in large part already in European waters, making Europe responsible for the secure and legal handling of asylum procedures. This is also an attempt to push these people out of sight - out of sight, out of mind. That is unacceptable. Asylum cases should be processed here, when the situation calls for it. We cannot avoid the problem. Is closer cooperation with North African countries for you the wrong way to better control the flow of refugees? Of course. We have to work with countries that are safe. It is not our intention that people take dangerous routes and cross the Mediterranean. Thousands died that way last year. What can the German government do to give people less incentive to take that risk? Thomas Oppermann already made some good suggestions - increased foreign aid, for example. Germany gives 0.5 percent of GDP to foreign aid. It will be 0.7 percent soon, and that is already something. Development aid is especially important when you consider how the movement of refugees has been stoked the last few years, for example due to reduced aid to refugee camps in Lebanon. That was also European policy. We have to find legal paths, too. Oppermann has already made immigration policy a talking point, such as migrant work. Elsewhere, there is our cooperation with UNHCR, which opens up the possibility for legal paths for refugees.

Oppermann\\'s comments certainly were not approved, rejected by (SPD chancellor candidate) Martin Schulz\\'s circle, and met with resistance throughout the party. Seeing that this was a one-off comment, I hope it was not an attempt at rebranding on the part of Oppermann at the expense of the SPD, as someone ready to become interior minister in the image of Otto Schily (who served in the position under Gerhard Schr?der from 1998-2005 and was known for his hard-line, law-and-order stance).

       " ['BayernLB under pressure over Dakota pipeline investment Bavaria\\'s state bank is set to invest about $120 million in the Dakota Access Pipeline, which threatens a Native American reservation and drinking water. Other banks have already sold their stake. There aren\\'t many members of the Sioux tribe living in Bavaria, but, thanks to the tentacles of international finance, the protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) being built near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation-in the US-have reached-the streets of-Munich. Last week, protesters from an alliance of NGOs arrived on the doorstep-of the BayernLB bank to deliver more than 700,000 signatures. They had been-collected via worldwide petitions against DAPL\\'s-17 financial investors, including the Bavarian state bank, which is contributing $120 million (111 million euros)-of the total $2.5 billion cost.-More than 220,000 signatures were on a petition specifically aimed at BayernLB, though that figure had almost-climbed to 300,000-by-Monday 6. Despite an invitation from environmental campaigners Urgewald, BayernLB-declined to send any representatives outside the building to receive the petition. \"But we were allowed to go in with a delegation of three people, and we gave the petition to the press spokesman,\" said Regine Richter, banking specialist at Urgewald. The bank itself is unwilling to give interviews on the subject, and in response to DW\\'s request would only send the public statement it issued in December, which had made many conciliatory noises. \"BayernLB is following the running discussions about the route of the pipeline very carefully and, as part of the consortium financing the pipeline, supports an amicable result of the discussions between the parties,\" it read. Wait and see BayernLB added that it was waiting on a report from the US law firm Foley Hoag,-commissioned in December to look into how the local indigenous people had been consulted on-the project. That report is due out later this month, but it may come too late, because within days of taking office-in January, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order decreeing that the environmental review for the project be fast-tracked. \"Nobody is really sure that means, but we are concerned that DAPL could get the green light any day now,\" Nick Pelosi, corporate engagement director for the campaign group First Peoples Worldwide, told DW.-\"It\\'s such an urgent matter at this point that we really don\\'t have time.\" Not only that,-Pelosi is also concerned that the study is being conducted behind closed doors and may be no more than a desktop-assessment. \"From what we understand, it is a study on tribal consultation, which is the crux of this issue - that the tribe was not consulted properly about this pipeline,\" Pelosi said. \"But nobody\\'s reached out to the tribe, so it\\'s essentially a study on consultation without any consultation.\" All 17 banks insist that the loans for DAPL-are now legally committed. \"But some have shown concern and that they are willing to exert the limited influence that they have,\" Pelosi said. \"I definitely think they\\'re feeling the pressure,\" he said. \"But what the tribe is asking is not necessarily for the banks to pull out, but to use their influence as project lenders to pressure the company into rerouting to avoid their treaty territory.\" The banks\\'-influence appears to be very limited indeed.-They argue that they can\\'t impose new conditions on the loans and that it isn\\'t their role to determine the route. \"Which is true - it\\'s the US government\\'s responsibility - but we\\'re asking them to support the reroute, not dictate it,\" Pelosi said. Dozens of protesters have been arrested at the Standing Rock reservation Passive bank Compared with other banks, BayernLB has been particularly recalcitrant. \"BayernLB was one of the few that outright rejected our request for dialogue,\" said Pelosi. \"BayernLB is being much too passive,\" Richter said. \"Banks like the Dutch ING and the Norwegian DNB are at least expressing public criticism of the pipeline consortium\\'s behavior or are selling stakes in the companies involved.\" Meanwhile in Germany, BayernLB\\'s involvement in the project has raised some political hackles - firstly because it is partly owned by the state, and secondly because it received a colossal taxpayer-funded 10-billion-euro ($9.3-billion) bailout during Europe\\'s financial crisis in 2008. \"BayernLB should not be allowed to support the dirty business of climate denier Donald Trump,\" said Anton Hofreiter, the Greens\\' parliamentary leader and a native of Bavaria. \"This project destroys the environment, is a risk for the drinking water from the Missouri River-and-at the same time-desecrates the Native Americans\\' cultural heritage.\" Hofreiter, along with other German politicians, is sure that BayernLB\\'s commitment to the project could be reversed by Bavaria\\'s state government. \"I\\'m sure it\\'s possible,\" Frank Schwabe, Bundestag member for the Social Democrats, told DW. \"The bank has oversight committees, and there is political influence on that, so it would be good if the politicians in Bavaria would take a clear position on it. We\\'re discussing the issue of company and bank responsibility more and more, and I think that a state bank in particular needs to stick to that.\"'],\n",

The visit\\'s highlight will be a meeting with Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of the ruling Law and Justice Party. Donald Trump\\'s US presidential victory made clear to Poland how dire its geopolitical situation is. Media are shifting ever more attention to neighboring Germany. On Tuesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel will make a brief, but appointment-packed visit to Warsaw. \"The Merkel of last resort: Poland and Germany are bound to each other,\" wrote \"Tygodnik Powszechny,\" a Roman-Catholic weekly based in Krakow. Poznan\\'s weekly, \"Wprost,\" calls the relationship between the two countries a \"marriage of convenience,\" with photographs of the chancellor in a near embrace with Jaroslaw Kaczynski.

Trade between the two countries hit 100 billion euros in 2016 ($107 billion). Defense cooperation is for the most part good. Russia policy is also on the same page, apart from the Baltic Sea pipeline. Regional disagreements are mounting. The European Union has filed suit against Poland on account of its government\\'s handling of the rule of law. Berlin has not publicly commented on the feud, looking to avoid a \"bilateralization\" of an EU-level matter. Talks in Warsaw will center on the future of the EU and migration policy. Poland is looking to tweak membership obligations in favor of member states, something Berlin rejects. \"If we start with one country, it opens a Pandora\\'s Box,\" said one German diplomat. Berlin and Warsaw are in agreement on more strongly securing EU borders and countering the causes of refugee movement. How that may affect the situation within the EU remains an unanswered question. The German government hopes for a \"fair sharing of the burden\" of refugees, a position that circumvents many countries\\' continued opposition to refugee resettlement and at most means a sharing of the financial burden. In late 2014, with the war in Syria approaching its fourth year and Islamic State making gains in the north of the country, the exodus of Syrians intensified. At the same time, others were fleeing violence and poverty in countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Eritrea, Somalia, Niger and Kosovo. Vast numbers of Syrian refugees had been gathering in border-town camps in neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan since 2011. By 2015, with the camps full to bursting and residents often unable to find work or educate their children, more and more people decided to seek asylum further afield. In 2015 an estimated 1.5 million people made their way on foot from Greece towards western Europe via the \"Balkan route\". The Schengen Agreement, which allows passport-free travel within much of the EU, was called into question as refugees headed towards the wealthier European nations. Tens of thousands of refugees were also attempting the perilous journey across the Mediterranean on overcrowded boats. In April 2015, 800 people of various nationalities drowned when a boat traveling from Libya capsized off the Italian coast. This was to be just one of many similar tragedies - by the end of the year, nearly 4,000 refugees were reported to have died attempting the crossing. Countries along the EU\\'s external border struggled to cope with the sheer number of arrivals. Fences were erected in Hungary, Slovenia, Macedonia and Austria. Asylum laws were tightened and several Schengen area countries introduced temporary border controls. Critics of German Chancellor Angela Merkel\\'s \"open-door\" refugee policy claimed it had made the situation worse by encouraging more people to embark on the dangerous journey to Europe. By September 2016, Germany had also introduced temporary checks on its border with Austria. In early 2016, the EU and Turkey signed an agreement under which refugees arriving in Greece could be sent back to Turkey. The deal has been criticised by human rights groups and came under new strain following a vote by the European Parliament in November to freeze talks on Turkey\\'s potential accession to the EU. With anti-immigration sentiment in Europe growing, governments are still struggling to reach a consensus on how to handle the continuing refugee crisis. Attempts to introduce quotas for the distribution of refugees among EU member states have largely failed. Conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere show no signs coming to an end, and the death toll from refugee sea crossings is on the rise. Author: Rachel Stewart Points of clarification A lack of concrete ideas from Poland makes cooperation especially difficult for Berlin. A pan-European military is a prime example, an idea both Kaczynski and Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary have now and then thrown into the mix. It remains unclear what the Visegrad Group - Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary - actually want. Poland\\'s government has its reasons to view Brexit and Trump differently than Germany\\'s does. Both pose problems for Germany, which could allow Poland - with its government\\'s lukewarm stance towards the EU - a chance to \"strengthen its position and significance,\" writes the political scientist, Olaf Osica, in Tygodnik Powszechny. The Polish political establishment takes umbrage with the \"[German] inability to accept other points of view, based on its steadfast conviction in its own universal policies\" believed capable of solving nearly every problem in the world. Citing a number of policy differences - migration, energy, climate and the Eurozone among them --Osica concludes that these are \"independent of the party in power\" and have been openly debated only since the change in government. It is hoped that the-meeting with Merkel will be a \"serious conversation about serious topics and the defining of common interests.\"'],\n",
       " ['Neuer: Things aren\\'t working the way we\\'d like at the moment Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer has admitted that the German champions are struggling to play the brand of football they want to under Carlo Ancelotti. Bayern face Wolfsburg in the German Cup tomorrow. The Bavarians were held at home by Schalke on Saturday but extended their lead at the top of the table to four points after RB Leipzig\\'s loss. Despite their league position and seven points from nine since the return from the winter break, Ancelotti\\'s side have faced their fair share of criticism from both the media and fans. And ahead of Tuesday\\'s-game, which sees the previous two winners of the German Cup clash at Allianz Arena, Germany\\'s number 1 admitted that some of that talk is justified. \"Things that have always been our trademarks like pace and accurate passing aren\\'t working the way we\\'d like at the moment,\" he said. Neuer\\'s feelings were echoed by Philipp Lahm, who said \"it\\'s clear we want to play better football.\" Lahm, who made his 500th competitive appearance for Bayern when he came off the bench against Schalke, said the team needed to improve against Wolfsburg and with a Champions League last 16 tie with-Arsenal -just around the corner. \"There\\'s nothing at all wrong at the moment, but the players have to be aware that we can\\'t play the way we did in the last three matches over the next few weeks,\" the club\\'s skipper-said. Wolfsburg, who beat Bayern on penalties in the 2015 final, have somewhat deeper problems. Valerien Ismael\\'s side are just three points clear of the relegation play off spot and lost to Cologne at the weekend. But Ismael is a believer in the old adage that the form book goes out the window in Cup games. \"The Cup has it\\'s own laws,\" he said on Monday.-\"We are going into the game confidently and will look to take our chance.\" mp (DPA/Reuters)'],\n",
       " ['German Cup: What to watch out for in the last 16 For Dortmund it\\'s a question of priorities but some of the Bundesliga\\'s sleeping giants will welcome their sole shot at glory. And can Lotte upset the odds again? Here\\'s what to look out for in this week\\'s cup games. Can Lotte hit the jackpot again? The last 16 of the German Cup features seven-teams from outside the top flight but there\\'s no doubt that Sportfreunde Lotte are the darlings of this season\\'s competition. The tiny club from Germany\\'s north-west were in the regional leagues until last year but have already seen off Bundesliga heavyweights Bayer Leverkusen and-Werder Bremen. The 10,000 capacity Frimo Stadion is sure to be rocking once again on Wednesday for the visit of 2nd division 1860 Munich. The Bavarians, who made a high profile appointment earlier in the week, have struggled for consistency this term and lost again at the weekend. A division may divide the teams but there are only 11 places between them in the league pyramid. The home side will fancy their chances of making the last eight. Who will Tuchel pick? Thomas Tuchel\\'s team are still fighting on three fronts A win over a Leipzig and suddenly things are looking up again at Dortmund. Their inconsistency in the Bundesliga means Thomas Tuchel\\'s side can all but write off the title for another year and also means the Champions League seems an unlikely goal. Which leaves the German Cup. BVB squeaked through in the last round, requiring penalties to see off Union Berlin. In that match, Tuchel fielded a side peppered with fringe players and almost paid the price. Making the same move against Union\\'s city rivals Hertha would be a bold move. Pal Dardai\\'s side are solid and fit and the Hungarian coach has said he\\'s looking to take the match in to extra time. Tuchel must balance his desire for fresh first teamers with the hunger for silverware. Contrary to the normal thought process, perhaps the Bundesliga game against doomed Darmstadt on Saturday is a better opportunity to rest players ahead of the resumption of the Champions League, against Benfica, on February 14. Will -struggling mid-table trio take it seriously? The cup is Gladbach\\'s best chance of success in 2016/17 The same questions of priority-apply to a host of the Bundesliga\\'s mid-table sides. Schalke may have their own European adventure but they \"?along with Borussia M?nchengladbach and Wolfsburg \"?must see the German Cup as their only chance of glory in seasons that have been various shades of-underwhelming. Wolfsburg have a daunting task when they visit-Bayern Munich on Tuesday-but Schalke (away to Sandhausen on Wednesday) and Gladbach (away to Greuther F¨¹rth on Tuesday) will both expect to progress. This underachieving trio all finished in the Bundesliga\\'s top 8 last term, they all look relatively safe from relegation (though Wolfsburg must still look over their shoulders)-and Europe seems a long shot. A cup exit and many fans will feel their season is over before the end of February. Can Hannover prove their Bundesliga credentials? Hannover were relegated from the Bundesliga last season Two of last season\\'s underachievers meet in Hannover on Wednesday and both have turned their form around. Hannover were wretched in finishing bottom of the Bundesliga-last term but have bounced back to top Bundesliga 2, while Niko Kovac\\'s Eintracht Frankfurt are third in the top tier after surviving in the relegation play off last time round. For Hannover this is a chance to prove they belong back at the table while the Eagles will want to maintain their momentum as the business end of the season approaches.'],\n",
       " ['Indian state elections - A referendum on PM Modi\\'s demonetization policy Five Indian states are electing new governments over the next few weeks. The votes will prove to be a key test of PM Modi\\'s popularity, which has taken a hit due to his demonetization move. Murali Krishnan reports. Indians went to the polls on Saturday, February 4, in the first two of five state elections that experts say are a major popularity test for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The premier\\'s approval ratings have dropped since his controversial move in November last year to scrap high-denomination currency notes, dubbed locally as \"demonetization.\" Weeks after Modi announced the-drastic move to withdraw all 500- and 1,000-rupee notes from circulation, the monetary situation in Asia\\'s third-largest economy has yet to normalize and most people across the country continue to face problems accessing cash for their daily needs. The government has said the move will bring billions of unaccounted money into the formal banking system and clean India\\'s economy of \"black money,\" a term used in the country to refer to unaccounted, untaxed wealth. But since the announcement, serpentine queues have lined up outside banks and ATMs of people replacing their rupee notes or making small withdrawals. And Modi\\'s administration has faced sharp criticism over the slow pace of introducing the new notes, with banks running out of cash and ATMs having to be recalibrated to cope with the different sized bills - a process that is still incomplete. The Indian government\\'s recent surprise decision to ban all high-value currency notes in circulation has affected almost everyone in the country. Economist Rajiv Biswas talks to DW about the effectiveness of the move. (24.11.2016) One of the world\\'s fastest growing economies is projected to experience a slowdown in the current fiscal year. India\\'s economy is forecast to grow by 7.1 percent, which would be its slowest rate of growth in three years. (06.01.2017) India wants to go digital and cash becomes outdated overnight. Prime minister Modi certainly wants to do the right thing. But with the demonetization move his calculation just doesn\\'t add up, writes Katja Keppner. (02.12.2016) Months after India\\'s PM Narendra Modi shocked the nation with an abrupt high-value banknote ban, hitting the country\\'s economic growth, the government has announced a plethora of sops to ease the pain. (01.02.2017) The Indian economy\\'s high reliance on cash only adds to the crisis. Furthermore, many in the South Asian nation lack proper access to banks and financial services. The uncertainty caused by the shock decision has also led foreign investors to withdraw huge amounts of capital from the country and put it elsewhere. The resulting slide in the rupee has sparked speculation that the country\\'s central bank may intervene to shore up the currency. Crucial elections The state elections are being held against this backdrop.-The five states, where the votes are taking place, are home to a fifth of the country\\'s 1.25 billion-strong population. While the voters in the western states of Punjab and Goa cast their ballots on Saturday, polls will be held in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand in the north and Manipur in the northeast between February 11 and March 8. As predicted by political analysts, the demonetization controversy has dominated the crucial state elections. Opposition parties are trying to use the currency controversy to their advantage as the rural population in the states has faced the brunt of the premier\\'s demonetization decision. In the states of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, farmers are finding it difficult to buy pesticides for the winter crops. \"It is a serious issue as cash scarcity has affected vast swathes of India\\'s rural hinterland. If the objective of the demonetization move was to target the rich, it has not been effective,\" Vinod Singh, a-farmer from Uttar Pradesh, told DW. The election in Uttar Pradesh is crucial for Modi given its enormous significance in Indian politics. Being the most populous state in the country, with over 200 million inhabitants,-it elects the highest number of lawmakers to both houses of Indian parliament. Modi\\'s Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 73 out of the state\\'s 80 Lok Sabha - the lower house of parliament --seats in the 2014 general election, a stunning performance that helped the party secure an absolute majority for the first time. Experts say India\\'s abrupt demonetization \\'seems completely silly\\' - But it won\\'t be an easy ride for the BJP in the state-level polls this time around, warn-experts. The electoral alliance between the regional Samajwadi Party and the Congress party has given a boost to BJP\\'s-opposition. In Punjab, the chances of the Aam Aadmi Party-(Common Man\\'s Party), an outfit campaigning against corruption, securing victory are pretty sound. Several polls following the weekend vote indicate that the party, which has a government in Delhi, could win the Punjab state election. \"It was an election of hopes. People have high hopes, and we will together fulfill those hopes,\" Arvind Kejriwal, the AAP chief, said after the vote. If the BJP performs well in this crucial round of state polls, analysts believe it would be interpreted as an endorsement of PM Modi\\'s policies. A defeat could force the party to reconsider its strategies. Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/2X52r -'],\n",
       " ['10 things you should know about the Berlinale Richard Gere and Pen¨¦lope Cruz will be there, and you can watch a new TV series about a fictional, Nazi-run Britain. From stars and prizes to politics, here\\'s everything you need to know about the Berlinale. 1. How many films are being shown? The 67th Berlinale, which runs from February 9-12, 2017, presents a total of 399 films. The number of showing is much higher as many of those films are being shown multiple times. Over one quarter of the films on the agenda were directed by women. 2. Is there one overarching theme? No. There are several themes that dominate the various programs. Some of them focus on the fate of refugees, such as the in-competition contribution of Finnish filmmaker Aki Kaurism?ki, \"The Other Side of Hope.\" Also this year, the Berlinale, in keeping with its long tradition of focusing on political topics, is presenting numerous documentaries. As 2017 is the 100th anniversary of the October Revolution, some of the contributions deal with political utopias. The section \"Panorama\" shows films on homosexuality, as well as African films and films dealing with racism.- Aki Kaurism?ki\\'s \"The Other Side of Hope\" is vying for a Gold Bear Even though it\\'s been all over the news, the name \"Donald Trump\" wasn\\'t mentioned at all during the Berlinale\\'s opening press conference. \"Our program in itself is already a strong form of protest,\" responded Berlinale director Dieter Kosslick when asked how the festival would be responding to the new US president. 3. Which stars will be there? This year, Hollywood actors including Richard Gere and Ethan Hawke, Cillian Murphy and Robert Pattinson will be making appearances. The female stars that\\'ve marked Berlinale in their calendars tend to be from Europe, such as C¨¦cile de France, Pen¨¦lope Cruz, Catherine Deneuve and Kristin Scott Thomas. Australian stars Geoffrey Rush and Hugh Jackman, as well as German actors Nina Hoss, Moritz Bleibtreu, August Diehl, Bruno Ganz and Hanna Schygulla are also expected. 4. Which German films are being shown? This year, German films are strongly represented with 104 works shown in various program sections, as well as three films in competition by Volker Schl?ndorff, Thomas Arslan and Andres Veiel. In addition, young German filmmakers will be shown exclusively in the series \"Perspektive Deutsches Kino\" (Perspective on German film). Thirty-six German films will run in the section \"Lola\" which caters to foreign film distributors. 5. Which international highlights can be expected?

The Berlinale also offers a platform to new discoveries and lesser-known filmmakers that have promising careers ahead of them.- 6. Which program series are particularly-important? In addition to the competition and the well-established series \"Panorama\" and \"Forum,\" the section \"Generation\" tends to draw crowds. Many Berlinale fans love this part of the festival as it\\'s-directed towards very young audiences. But there\\'s also something in store adults. The section \"NATIVe\" shows films focusing on indigenous peoples in northern Europe. \"Kulinarisches Kino\" (Culinary cinema) not only shows works on food and the environment,-but also invites audiences to actually sit down and enjoy a real bite.-Finally, the \"Berlinale Shorts\" fascinates short film fans.- 7. What does the Berlinale contribute to cinema history? Traditionally, the Berlinale also takes a look back at the past. This time, the historical retrospective is devoted to the science-fiction genre with both well-known newer films from Eastern Europe and Asia. The series \"Berlinale Classics\" presents restored historical works that haven\\'t been viewable in original for a long time, among them Helmut K?utner\\'s \"Schwarzer Kies\" (Black gravel) and the Mexican film \"Canoa.\" The digitally upgraded zombie classic \"Night of the Living Dead\" is likely to give viewers the creeps this year. 8. Does the film festival also present TV series? The awards will be presented on Saturday, February 18 Yes, watching entire series has become a tradition at the Berlinale. This year, viewers can look forward to \"4 Blocks\" by Marvin Kren featuring Berlin\\'s drug and clan scene, as well as \"SS-GB\" by Philipp Kadelbach, which is set in a fictional Britain where the Nazis were victorious.

His British counterpart, Theresa May, was under pressure to condemn Israel\\'s settlement expansion. On Monday, Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed US President Donald Trump\\'s introduction of-new sanctions against Iran and said other \"responsible nations\" should follow suit in view of what he called Iran\\'s recent \"defiant aggression.\" \"Iran seeks to annihilate Israel; it says so openly. It seeks to conquer the Middle East;-it threatens Europe;-it threatens the West;-it threatens the world,\" Netanyahu said during a meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May in London. \"I\\'d like to talk to you on how we can ensure that Iran\\'s aggression does not go unanswered,\" he told May, apparently referring to Iran\\'s test of a ballistic missile last week. -The Trump administration said Iran was formally \"on notice\" after the test, and the president has also voiced opposition to the Iran nuclear deal with major international powers. Netanyahu is also a fierce opponent of the 2015 deal, which Britain also signed. The agreement saw Iran-pledge to curb its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief. When asked whether Britain was considering new sanctions, a spokeswoman for May said \"the prime minister made clear that we support the deal on nuclear that was agreed.\" \"What happens now is that it needs to be properly enforced, and we also need to be alert to Iran\\'s pattern of destabilizing activity in the region,\" the spokeswoman said. Israel and Iran have been bitter enemies for well over-two decades. Different agendas Ahead of the talks between May and Netanyahu, Britain said it wanted Monday\\'s negotiations to focus on trade ties-as it seeks to bolster trade relations outside the European Union for when it leaves the bloc. The two leaders agreed to set up working groups to continue developing trade ties between the two countries.- May\\'s spokeswoman said the two leaders would also \"talk about a range of security and international issues, including the Middle East peace process.\" The spokeswoman said May would voice concern about how the \"continued increase of settlements activity undermines trust.\" At the beginning of the meeting, the prime minister said the UK remained \"committed to a two-state solution as the best way of brokering stability and peace.\" Israel has stepped up its expansion of settlements in the Palestinian territories since the inauguration of Trump, who is perceived as sympathetic to settlement building. Palestinians say the settlements in the West bank and east Jerusalem, which are home to 600,000 Israelis, are making a two-state solution harder to achieve, a position that has wide international backing-and was also held by Trump\\'s predecessor, Barack Obama. tj/rt (AFP, AP)'],\n",
       " ['Madrid restaurant offers homeless taste of luxury A restaurant in Madrid is transformed at night into an establishment where homeless and those in need are served a sophisticated dinner for free. Hagar Jobse reports. Maria Marte migrated to Spain in 2003 and started washing dishes in a Madrid restaurant. She stayed despite the economic crisis and is now a head chef with two Michelin stars to her name. Guy Hedgecoe reports. (01.08.2015) The financial crisis that began in 2008 obliterated millions of jobs in Spain. In the wake of the meltdown, around half of those under 30 are still unable to find a job. Santiago Saez reports from Madrid and Huelva. (29.12.2016) Spanish Twitter users are accusing the Catholic Church of prioritizing its presence in the media over traditional relief work. Others say the criticism is hypocritical. (25.01.2016) \"The worst of having to queue for your food is the shame,\" says Olga, who prefers not to reveal her last name, while she takes a bite of her Spanish omelette. Olga, a tiny woman with grey hair pulled into a ponytail, has been unemployed for almost 10 years. She has a roof above her head, but the monthly 400 euros ($430) she receives from the Spanish government are not enough to make it until the end of the month. So she has had to queue up outside, waiting for the social services to give her a sandwich. \"I am always afraid a family member or friend will see me,\" she tells DW. \"I went to university you know. What if I ran into someone from my class? What would they think?\" But tonight, Olga doesn\\'t have to stand in line for food. She is sitting at a table in Madrid\\'s recently opened Robin Hood restaurant, a fairly ordinary looking Spanish bar with a cigarette machine in the corner and a ham leg on the counter. Here, Olga is served dinner by professional waiters. Every half hour she is asked whether she wants another drink or a refill on her soup. During the day the Robin Hood restaurant is a regular establishment where customers pay 11 euros for a fixed menu. But at night the place transforms into an establishment where homeless and people in need like Olga are served a sophisticated-dinner for free. The business-model is simple: the earnings made at breakfast and lunch fund the evening meals for the homeless. The Robin Hood restaurant uses its daytime earnings to fund meals for the homeless Messengers of peace The restaurant is the latest initiative launched by the charity organization Mensajeros de la Paz, which means messengers of peace, and was founded 54 years ago by priest Angel Garcia Rodriguez. In conservative Spain Father Angel, as he is often called, is a revolutionary. For example, the church he opened two years ago in Madrid\\'s trendy Chueca neighborhood is open 24/7, has a WiFi connection, and features livestreams from the Vatican and religious films. During the winter months homeless are allowed to sleep on the church benches. When DW assists a service at the San Anton Church on Sunday, it is packed with people listening to Father Angel\\'s sermon. Unlike in other churches people are walking in and out and mumbling quietly. After the service Father Angel explains why the noise doesn\\'t bother him. \"In most churches you need to be silent. We don\\'t want to tell people how they must behave. We want them to feel welcome,\" he tells DW. Finding a connection: San Anton Church offers free WiFi to homeless people Father Angel says the idea to open the Robin Hood restaurant was inspired by Pope Francis. \"He always speaks about how important is to give people dignity. It is not only about giving food to the poor, it\\'s also about how you give it to them. So seeing the long lines of people waiting outside in the cold for food, I thought: \\'why don\\'t we serve these people food in a restaurant, with proper cutlery and crystal glasses instead of plastic cups?\\'\" The-economic crisis-in Spain has had a severe impact on the country and Spanish charities like Mensajeros de la Paz are still dealing with the consequences; 30 percent of Spaniards are living close to poverty and 300,000 people in the country are homeless. Helping the homeless Currently, 100 homeless and people in need, selected by the social services of Madrid, can have dinner at Robin Hood every night. \"They have a table reserved for them, just like paying customers when they go out for dinner,\" Father Angel explains. And it is that reservation Antonio Pachon, 62, looks forward to every day. Pachon has been living on the streets of different cities in Spain since he left his native Seville in 1996. \"During the day I usually wander around the city by myself,\" he explains. \"It\\'s nice to have a place like this where a seat is waiting for me and where I can talk with people I know. As soon as I step into the door of this restaurant, I forget about my problems. And when I leave I always feel a little lighter and happier.\" Maria Vizuete has worked in several upmarket restaurants but says her job in the Robin Hood has been the most fulfilling It\\'s 8 p.m. and 42-year-old waitress Maria Vizuete is running around with plates stacked in her hand. During a break she explains that she has more then 20 years of experience working in hotels and restaurant. \"I have worked in the Ritz and other expensive hotels. But when I was asked to work here I immediately said yes. Now I am working for people who really need it and that is very gratifying,\" she tells DW. Vizuete explains that the restaurant also tends to be full during the day. \"Two weeks in advance we are usually completely booked.\" During DW\\'s visit to the restaurant the place is packed. Elena Sanchez and a friend are just finishing desert. They think the food is wonderful and are glad they can help other people by coming here. \"Since the economic crisis in 2008 so many people have gotten into deep financial trouble after losing their jobs,\" Sanchez thinks the Spanish government hasn\\'t come up with enough solutions to fight-poverty in Spain. \"There is a big need of initiatives like the Robin Hood restaurant in our country,\" she tells DW.'],\n",
       " ['Syrian refugee takes Facebook to court in Germany A Syrian refugee in Germany - famous for a selfie he took with Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2015 - is taking Facebook to court. His motive is to stop the circulation of fake news posts showing his face. Facebook has been summoned to a district court in the southern city of W¨¹rzburg in what could mark a precedent in the fight against hatred and agitation in social networks. The-public hearing will take place on Monday to decide on an interim injunction against Facebook Europe - the first time the social media giant will take the stand in a German court over the spread of multiple \"fake news\" posts. While in a refugee camp in Berlin Spandau, Anas Modamani heard that the German Chancellor Angela Merkel was coming for a visit and would be talking to refugees. The 19-year-old Syrian, who is quite fond of social media, went to take a selfie. He was hoping for the selfie to inspire a real change in his life.. When Modamani\\'s house in Damascus was bombed, he fled with his parents and siblings to a smaller city called Garia. That is when Anas fled for Europe in the hope that his family could join him there, once he had made it. He first traveled to Lebanon and from there to Turkey and then on to Greece. Anas almost died on the way. In order to get to Greece from Turkey he had to travel in a rubber boat, like most refugees. Anas says the boat was overcrowded and eventually capsized and he almost drowned. From Greece Anas traveled by foot to Macedonia. He continued to Hungary and Austria. In September 2015, he reached his final destination: Munich. Once in Germany, he decided he wants to move to Berlin. He has been living there ever since. Upon arrival to Berlin, Anas spent entire days in front of the LaGeSo, a refugee center in the city. The 19-year-old says that the situation at the LaGeSo was difficult, especially during the winter. Eventually he was sent to the refugee center in Berlin Spandau. He wanted to raise awareness to his situation as a refugee and a selfie with Merkel seemed like the perfect chance to do exactly that. Anas says that the selfie with Chancellor Merkel was a life-changer for him. He got a lot of media attention after the photo was published online, and that is how his German foster family became aware of him. He has been living with them for 2 months now. They have been supporting him ever since he became a member of their family. Since living with the Meeuw\\'s Anas is happier than ever before. He is doing a German language course, has made a lot of friends and is doing a lot of cultural activities. He graduated high school in Syria and wants to pursue higher studies in Germany. But his main aim right now is to be officially granted asylum and to be able to bring his family to Germany as well. Anas is hoping for a good and safe life in Germany. But he is worried about the current sentiment towards refugees in the country. He thinks that the negative mood might escalate and have an impact on the laws in regard to refugees. Anas fears that he might not be granted asylum after all, thus ending his dream of bringing his family to Germany. Author: Rachel Baig Bavarian lawyer Chan-jo Jun filed an injunction on behalf of a young Syrian refugee who says his photo is being spread on social media with claims he is a terrorist,-or a ruthless criminal. \"Facebook is unusually difficult about implementing German law,\" Jun tells users who visit-his law office\\'s Facebook page. \"Slander and abusive insults are against German law, but not against its community standards.\" Widely shared fake news Modamani gained instant fame with a selfie he took in 2015 with the German chancellor when she visited the Berlin refugee shelter where the young newcomer was housed. He posted the picture on social media with no idea of the reception it might get, Modamani told DW in last month. German media snapped up a photo of the brief moment, and over the months, it has resurfaced on social media, too. A moment of silence a day after the suicide bombings in the Belgian capital Whenever there\\'s a refugee-related incident, he\\'s trotted out as Merkel\\'s model refugee, \"and the crimes are blamed on him,\" argues Jun. No one should have to put up with that, so now \"Modamani is fighting back,\" says the IT attorney, who has filed various legal complaints against the US social networking company, including demands that Facebook comply with Germany\\'s hate speech laws. Fighting back against slander Most recently, the photo of Modamani and false claims that he was part of a group that tried to set fire to a sleeping homeless man in a Berlin subway station in December was shared more than 500 times. It did not sufficiently violate Facebook\\'s community standards to be removed, the attorney says,-adding that his client\\'s image and the deprecatory comments can still be found on Facebook. Earlier in 2016, fake news content showed the 19-year-old refugee\\'s image in connection was the terrorist attacks in March in-Brussels, claiming he was one of them and had just pretended to be a refugee, with some sites insinuating Merkel took \"a selfie with a terrorist.\" In case of failure to comply with an order to stop circulation of the fake news about his client, Chan-jo Jun wants Facebook fined by up to 250,000 euros ($264,000.) The lawyer also says it\\'s high time to end the \"cat and mouse game\" involved in having to pursue Facebook in the-registered jurisdiction of-its European headquarters in Dublin.

       " ['First German supermarket sells waste food only The first supermarket to sell only salvaged food waste has opened in Germany. It marks a small step towards a zero-waste society - but a major shift in social awareness, says DW reporter Irene Banos Ruiz. From curious grannies to committed \"food-savers\", everyone who came to \"The Good Food\" when it opened on February 4-was excited by a-shop unlike anything they had ever encountered before. The store in the German city of Cologne is the first of its kind in the country and the-third one in the European Union. It sells-products of all kinds, from vegetables to beer. And the unusual thing is that all these products would otherwise have been destroyed as waste. The other peculiar thing about \"The Good Food\" is that there are no fixed prices. Consumers decide how much they think a product is worth. You only need to take one look at the figures to understand why Nicole Klaski decided to start \"The Good Food\". -Every year, one third of the food produced in the world gets wasted.- If we saved just a quarter of that wasted food, we could feed almost 900 million hungry people, according to the-Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Klaski and Thurn want to stop food waste. Valentin Thurn is an author and the award-winning director of the \"Taste the Waste\" documentary. He came along to the opening to celebrate what he sees as a positive move to combat food waste. But he also told DW there were still major challenges to be overcome. \"This idea is simply great,\" Thurn said. \"I still cannot understand why we throw so much food away!\" The starting point Well, actually, he says, he does have some idea. \"The trade knows we prefer to buy something that looks perfect,\" he said. Indeed, the FAO\\'s information shows that at retail level, food is mostly wasted because it does not look attractive. Klaski told DW it was time to take action to change this. She goes into fields after they have been harvested and collects the vegetables left behind. Some of them are deemed too big, some too small, some just too ugly to sell. In her shop, the organic food then becomes accessible to everyone using a \"pay what you think\" system. Buyers can also find non-perishable products from big manufacturers which have passed their sell-by dates. A customer checks the label on a bottle from the \"past the date but delicious\" shelf. \"No one wants to throw the food away,\" Klaski said. \"We save the vegetables and expired products, and the producers are happy that their food is still eaten.\" For her, the system is a \"win-win cooperation.\"- What about health risks? Some of the curious visitors having a look around \"The Good Food\" admitted they would not buy certain products if they were past the date. Others, however, said it was easy to tell by the color or smell if a product was still in good condition or not. Klaski herself is not worried that there could be health risks involved. \"The expiry dates on products are only a suggestion for the consumer,\" she told DW. \"Most of the products last much longer.\" But in the unfortunate event that someone really did get sick, someone has to carry the responsibility. That is why Klaski says the team takes their duty very seriously to inform consumers when a product is out of date. \"And, of course, if something happens we will have to take the responsibility,\" she added. \"But we are even willing to do that; it is worth trying.\" Part of a broader movement Contrary to traditional supermarkets\\' aim of making a profit, \"The Good Food\" aims at having a social impact. \"Pay what you like\", says the sign on these products. \"Our highest expectation is to raise awareness on the problem food waste represents,\" said Anja Rickert, a member of the team at \"The Good Food\".- She believes initiatives like this can motivate people who were not previously aware of issues relating to a sustainable lifestyle. Klaski is convinced that once the first step is taken, the rest follows on. The food waste shop is part of a broader movement to reduce consumption and be aware of how we consume, she said. The furniture used, for instance, is all second hand or recycled. And most of the consumers seem to share the same philosophy. \"Coming here represents more than just buying food, it is a way of life,\" one of the clients told DW. Beyond the social movement Author and film-maker Valentin Thurn has observed a huge change in attitudes since he produced \"Taste the Waste\" in 2010: \"At that time nobody spoke about food waste, literally nobody,\" Thurn said. \"Now many people are involved, even politicians.\" However, despite strong social movements such as food-sharing, food waste remains one of the major challenges of our time. Merchandising the leftovers is not enough to combat it, Thurn is convinced.- He believes imposing economic penalties could be the only effective way to really reduce waste. \"We have to find real solutions to reduce over-production,\" he said. And this can only be done through legislation to influence-the economy and businesses models. \"It\\'s not enough to rely on action from a few big business leaders who are aware of environmental issues,\"- he concluded. - -'],\n",
       " ['Merkel officially nominated as conservatives\\' candidate for German chancellor The Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party have officially chosen Angela Merkel as their nominee. Her main rival at September elections will be Social Democrat Martin Schulz. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was on Monday-officially nominated to run as her party\\'s candidate in this year\\'s federal elections, party sources say.-A leaders\\' meeting of her center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), confirmed the foregone conclusion at a meeting in Munich. There is \"unanimous support of both parties for Merkel\\'s candidacy,\" said Horst Seehofer, the leader of the CSU and premier of Bavaria. German Chancellor Merkel has highlighted her party\\'s common ground with its Bavarian ally as the parties plot a course for the upcoming election. The meeting comes amid a surge in support for the Social Democrats. (05.02.2017) SPD candidate Martin Schulz would receive 16 percent more votes than current CDU Chancellor Angela Merkel, a survey showed. The SPD has benefited since Schulz was nominated as the party\\'s candidate for the Chancellery. (02.02.2017) Martin Schulz has been nominated to run as the SPD chancellor candidate. Many people in the party are euphoric, but how will this new optimism change the Social Democrats? (31.01.2017) The 62-year-old has emerged as one of Merkel\\'s harshest critics within her own ranks in recent years, as Bavaria has borne the brunt of incoming migrants throughout the refugee crisis. Seehofer has called for a cap on the number of refugees, and in 2015-even threatened to file a complaint about the Merkel administration\\'s refugee policy with Germany\\'s highest court. In a press conference on Monday, Merkel-ruled out implementing a limit on refugee numbers, but said both the CSU and her own CDU party had agreed that the influx of more than 1 million people-in-2015-16 should not happen again. She also said the two parties would start working on a joint election platform for the upcoming vote. Agenda to be announced Merkel and Seehofer were expected to present the CDU/CSU election agenda as part of a joint statement late on Monday. A one-time research chemist from former east Germany, Merkel has been active in politics since shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. After a stint as the minister for women and youth and then the environment under former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, she became head of the CDU in 2000. She became chancellor herself in 2005 and has won every election contested since. Her main rival in the 2017 election will be current coalition partners the center-left Social Democrats (SPD)-and their candidate,-former European Parliament President Martin Schulz. es,nm/tj (AFP, dpa)'],\n",

A refugee from the Nazis, the former Miss Hungary embodied the ultimate diva in both big and small roles. She died just a few weeks before her 100th birthday on February 6. Born on February 6, 1917, the inimitable Zsa Zsa Gabor didn\\'t get to become a centenarian, as she died on December 18, 2016-- just a few weeks before her 100th birthday.- A-movie star for the ages, the former Miss Hungary fled her country just before World War II, joining her first husband, Turkish diplomat-Burhan Belge,-in London in June 1939. Later moving to Los Angeles, the child of a prosperous family embodied a fur-and-diamonds lifestyle that became something of a trademark, along with her thick Eastern European accent. The original diva, she began starring in movies in 1950s Hollywood, taking on roles in-\"Lovely to Look At,\" \"Moulin Rouge,\" \"Lili,\" Orson Welles\\' \"Touch of Evil\" and even the camp classic \"Queen of Outer Space.\" Everybody\\'s darling Known for her trademark Eastern European accent and habit of calling everyone \"Darling,\" Gabor continued her career making-television appearances until well into her 70s.

DW\\'s head of culture, Rolf Rische, explains how. DW: What\\'s new about the German-language program offered by DW? Rolf Rische: DW\\'s new German-language TV programs will include-much more cultural content than before. We interpret culture in a very broad sense: We don\\'t want to talk only about cultural highlights in literature, film and music, but also about culture\\'s social dimensions, for instance traditions and values. Our new program isn\\'t just the TV equivalent of the feature pages of a traditional newspaper;-it\\'s-much more exciting television that keeps our audience up-to-date on culture, business, sports,-science-and so much more. As always with DW, you can watch the German program anywhere in the world. For live stream access via the internet, simply click on the \"Live TV\" button in the upper left corner. You can also watch most shows per video on demand on the DW-website under the heading \"TV.\" Viewers are sure to find their favorites, from \"Europe in Concert\" and \"Kino\" to \"Kulturzeit\" and \"Shift.\" Viewers can also use the DW App under \"TV\" live to follow the German TV program on their phones. Of course, the German TV program will also continue to be broadcast in the usual manner, reaching Eastern Europe, Asia, Oceania, North and South America via satellite. Direct reception is only possible with a very large satellite dish - but DW has more than 250 broadcast partners offering the entire range of DW\\'s German TV program. \"Multichoice\" gives viewers in South Africa and nine other African countries access to the German-language program in its \"DSTv Premium\" channel. Viewers in Canada can turn to \"Shaw Cablesystems\" for DW\\'s German broadcasts. Who is your target audience? Each and every viewer interested in Germany and Europe, or in German and European points of view. And of course everyone who enjoys culture - and who wouldn\\'t? Rolf Rische is DW\\'s head of culture and society and German TV If you have a look at the schedule, you\\'ll see we\\'re truly offering a lot of culture. New, genuine cultural-content, such as the music magazine \"PopXport\" on Mondays of-each-week,-as well as a-new show called \"Kulturzeit\" that will-air-five days a week and that is acquired-from broadcasters ZDF, ORF, SRF and ARD. Sundays, watch out for the successful and-popular show \"Kultur.21.\" Then, we have a set of new shows that are all about literature: \"druckfrisch,\"-\"lesenswert\" and \"B¨¹cherjournal\" give us the opportunity to present a weekly literature broadcast. I know no other program that has such a spectrum. Another novelty is-an almost one-hour-long current affairs show entitled \"Der Tag,\" with a daily guest, and a special slot for cultural-content. Those are just three of a series-of additions that promise to make the program more exciting, as well as giving it a clear cultural-profile. Will most of that content focus on high-brow culture? No, by no means. Perhaps the line between serious \"high-brow\" culture and entertainment is more pronounced in Germany than elsewhere, but that is not true for us, the creators of the television programs. For us, there\\'s only good culture, and perhaps less good culture. Most of all, we want to get our audience interested in good movies, good music, good books, no matter whether they belong to the high culture or the pop culture category. Who would dismiss the unrivaled electronic music band Kraftwerk-as unimportant entertainment, but automatically categorize the one millionth performance of the opera \"Tosca\" on a second rate stage as high culture? People who live in ivory towers and would rather stay there, isolated, that\\'s who. We, on the other hand, are always on the lookout for quality,-beyond what I regard as totally superfluous categories. Take our award-winning film-\"Teodor Currentzis, the classical rebel,\" which tells the story of a conductor and his orchestra working on Mozart\\'s \"Don Giovanni.\" In a way, that is high culture - but most of all, it\\'s a highly entertaining movie. It\\'s a quality film, and the protagonists, Teodor Currentzis and the MusicAeterna orchestra, are really good, too. Forget the distinctions between high-brow and popular culture to focus on what\\'s good - such as Kraftwerk That said, we plan to continue to show music documentaries, but also German comedy shows like \"Ladies Night\" and \"Nuhr.\" Of course, we will also continue to broadcast the entertaining shows that have had a loyal audience for many years, including the daily \"Euromaxx - Leben und Kultur in Europa,\"-the travel show \"Check-in\" and the music show \"PopXport.\" Why are you focusing on culture at this point? Mainly because the viewers are very interested in culture, as DW\\'s market and media researchers have found out. In addition, it\\'s a perfect fit with DW\\'s chartered mission. According to the DW Act, the broadcaster is intended \"to convey the image of Germany as a cultural state in the European tradition and as a free and democratic constitutional state. They should provide a forum in Europe and on other continents for German (and other) points of view on important topics, primarily in the areas of politics, culture, and economics.\" Promoting understanding and the exchange of ideas among different cultures and peoples is Deutsche Welle\\'s mission. And that is what we hope to achieve with the new German-language program. There simply is no better approach to the values and identity of a society than via culture. By nature, the dialogue of cultures nurtures understanding. In these uneasy times, one is tempted to rephrase a well-known, decades-old German advertising slogan for a tonic based on natural herbs: \"Culture - never more valuable than today.\" -'],\n",
       " ['Queen Elizabeth celebrates 65 years on the throne February 6 marks the 65th anniversary of the day Elizabeth became Queen of England. She is the first British monarch to reach a Blue Sapphire Jubilee. Here are more records broken by Her Majesty. Elizabeth ascended the throne at the age of 25, on February 6, 1952 - the day her father, King George VI, died. Already the longest-reigning British monarch since 2015, Queen Elizabeth II is now making history once again by becoming the first to celebrate a Sapphire Jubilee. The gallery above goes through some of the records detained by monarchs in the UK and around the world.- A traditional gun salute and a performance by the Band of the Royal Artillery is planned to underline the record-breaking anniversary. However, celebrations should remain limited this year. The Queen is said to want to quietly devote the day to her father\\'s memory. Larger celebrations could, however, be planned for the Queen\\'s next big anniversary, her Platinum Jubilee in 2022. As the gallery below shows, no matter how big or small the event, Her Majesty certainly knows how to dress for every occasion.-- - The Queen\\'s outfits are legendary. Her fancy hats always match with her suits and her hemlines are weighted down - to prevent windy wardrobe embarrassments. Then there\\'s the handbag: It always has the same shape. Classic, black, it\\'s just big enough to hold her lipstick, reading glasses, mint lozenges, and a handkerchief. That\\'s how the world has known her for the past 60 years. Queen Elizabeth II rarely shows up bareheaded. She has hats in all shapes and colors. Some are light and playful, trimmed with little flowers, while others look strict and sober. They always match with her outfits. Who could tell how many she actually has? It\\'s one of the world\\'s best-kept secrets. Even when she was younger, she was the queen of headgear. Here she is on the beach, donning a casual hippy style. This picture belongs to a series of historical photos of the Queen which were auctioned in 2008. A private collector can now smile with her every day. Even a princess needs to pitch in: During World War II, Elizabeth Windsor was part of the Auxiliary Territorial Service, the women\\'s division of the British Army. She learned mechanics and how to drive trucks. This picture was taken in 1945 - once again, with headgear. Two years after the war, Elizabeth married her childhood sweetheart, Prince Phillip of Greece and Denmark. Hundreds of ration coupons were collected to purchase her wedding gown: After the war, it was still difficult to obtain such valuable materials, even for the royal house. The satin dress was embroidered with 10,000 pearls and crystals and had a four-meter-long (13-foot) bridal train of lace. At the coronation ceremony On June 2, 1953, she wore a white silk dress with colorful embroideries representing the emblems of the Commonwealth of Nations. Attached to her shoulders, a five-meter-long (16-foot) velvet mantle was carried by six maids of honor. It was billed \"the visit of the century.\" In May 1965, the Queen was West Germany\\'s most welcome official foreign guest. 56 years had gone by since the last visit by a British state official - and two wars, during which both countries had experienced great suffering. Queen Elizabeth II spent 11 days traveling through the young Federal Republic - and charmed the Germans with her outfits. After Elizabeth II enchanted Germany with her whimsical hats, she opted for a more traditional style for her Austrian state visit in 1969. She wore a white silk dress with a red sash, and a diadem instead of a hat. In 1978, Elizabeth II came to Germany for the second time. Although she was once again received with great pomp, the procession was more modest than the one for her first visit. Over the years, normalcy and even friendship characterized the two countries\\' relations. Former German president Walter Scheel, pictured here, contributed to consolidating these ties. In February 1972, the Queen visited King Bhumibol in Thailand. She\\'d obviously have a stately gown and diadem in her suitcase, but also a few playful outfits as well (with matching hats, of course). Even though it\\'s cheerful, her summery ensemble on this picture doesn\\'t seem frivolous. Nothing can diminish her royal style - not even these 3D glasses. The Queen wore them while visiting the University of Sheffield, where she was invited to operate an excavator with a 3D display. When the Queen is not on state visits, she often prefers a modest headscarf to her designer hats. Suddenly the royal guise is concealed: She rather looks like a good-natured grandmother, pictured here in 2012. She kept it tweedy while riding with the former U.S. President Ronald Reagan in 1982. The Queen showed him around the grounds of Windsor Castle, her favorite residence. On July 29, 1981, Elizabeth\\'s son Prince Charles married Lady Diana in what was considered the \"fairytale wedding of the century.\" Although the Queen apparently played a major role in the couple\\'s union, she didn\\'t manage to steal the spotlight from her daughter-in-law that day - not even in bright turquoise. When Prince William married Kate in 2011, the Queen wore a much more relaxed dress than at the wedding of Charles and Diana. Here she\\'s pictured arriving at Westminster Abbey in a sober yellow outfit. Every year for the Queen\\'s speech, she traditionally wears her official royal regalia. The speech always marks the formal beginning of a new legislative period for the British Parliament and outlines the projects of the government for the upcoming session. The Queen still dresses up in royal robes. Here she is with Prince Philip in front of Saint Paul\\'s Cathedral, during a church service in honor of the Order of the British Empire, a highly respected order of merit. The Queen turned 90 in 2016. Although she was born on April 21, 1926, her official birthday is celebrated in June, because the weather is usually nicer for outdoor ceremonies. On June 13, 2015, she drove through London with her husband Prince Philip in an all-white suit, which matched her hair perfectly. Author: Silke W¨¹nsch / eg'],\n",

       " ['Bundesliga matchday 19: Talking points Do Bayern Munich rely too much on one man? Why can\\'t RB Leipzig beat the big boys? Is Mahmoud Dahoud back on track under Hecking? All this and more in this week\\'s Bundesliga talking points. Dahoud front and center of Hecking\\'s revolution Although Lars Stindl\\'s individual goal in Borussia M?nchengladbach\\'s win over Freiburg will undoubtedly be the highlight worth watching this weekend, do spare a thought for the wonderful one-two between Raffael and Mahmoud Dahoud for the Foal\\'s second goal. The young attacking midfielder has reverted back to looking very much like the prodigy that first burst on the scene last season. It\\'s seems no coincidence that this has happened so soon after Dieter Hecking took over as coach. Against Freiburg, Bayer Leverkusen last week and Darmstadt the week before, Dahoud has pulled strings and dictated play at the very heart of Hecking\\'s new-look side. And as such the Foals have quickly begun moving up the league table, now back up to tenth. Lewandowski-reliant Bayern finally stumble Robert Lewandowski has a habit of making art out of football. Two weeks ago he turned a cold, wet night in Freiburg in to a stage for some game-winning magic. He\\'s done it a number of times for Bayern Munich - and this weekend\\'s-wonderful chipped finish to take the lead against Schalke was no exception. However the Polish international\\'s talent has also underlined a problem with Bayern this season;-nobody else really seems up to the task of helping him win games. Lewandowski currently has 15 league goals. The next man on the goalscoring charts is the injury-prone Arjen Robben with six and then its defender Joshua Kimmich with four, who hasn\\'t scored since October. Indeed the team hasn\\'t been playing well at all this season but for large parts of the league campaign the Polish striker has pulled them out of trouble. Unfortunately, against a stubborn Schalke side, that wasn\\'t the case. Robert Lewandowski scored his 15th goal of the season against Schalke Leipzig missing key players Although RB Leipzig\\'s strength in depth is undoubtedly one of their key assets-and a large part of their success this season, at a certain level you need your very best players for the big games. This became abundantly clear in Saturday\\'s clash with Borussia Dortmund, when a flu-ridden Timo Werner made way for-David Selke, who was tasked with leading the line. Unfortunately, the young striker fell well short of this goal and-found himself back on the bench in the second half. Indeed, Leipzig were also missing Emil Forsberg, Marcel Sabitzer and Diego Demme in a performance that seems to suggest that the key players in this team are exactly that - key to any sustained success in the Bundesliga. Dortmund struggling up front Dortmund, on the other hand, are struggling with a completely different problem: they have the key players fit and ready but such stars are still struggling to deliver the goods each week. Ousmanne Dembele\\'s dribble, run and cross for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\\'s opening goal was a thing of beauty but when the euphoria of picking up all three points against Leipzig wears off fans of the club will perhaps wonder why he can\\'t do exactly that from one game to the next. Indeed, Marco Reus\\' string of misses in the second half highlighted the simple facts. Dortmund have scored 13 fewer goals in the league this season than they had done at this point last year. Over-19 games it\\'s easy to imagine just how many more points Thomas Tuchel\\'s side would be sitting on if they could reach that-same potency in front of goal-again - maybe even all eight separating them and Leipzig in second. Ousmane Dembele (pictured jumping) set up the winner with an outstanding run and cross Consistent Frankfurt are Champions League contenders Whilst all the attention has centered around RB Leipzig, Hoffenheim and Dortmund, Niko Kovac has overseen a quiet revolution in Frankfurt.-Their 3-0 defeat in Leipzig aside (where they played with ten men for 87 minutes after Lukas Hradecky\\'s moment of madness), Eintracht have only lost one other Bundesliga game since October to find themselves third.- Statistically, the improvement can be explained by defensive solidity - by the end of the Hinrunde, the first half of-the season, Frankfurt had conceded 13 goals less than they had at the same stage last season.- But what cannot be explained in simple mathematics is the change in team spirit since Kovac took charge. Kovac is close to sporting director Fredi Bobic and together, the two have established a tangible sense of togetherness in the dressing room, with Alex Meier telling kicker magazine in November that the team are \"much more compact\" and willing to work for one another. Goal-scoring, however, remains a sticking point, with Frankfurt having found the net less than any other side in the top seven. If Kovac\\'s Frankfurt family can find a solution to that as well, there\\'s no reason they can\\'t continue to fight for a Champions League place.- When Schalke conceded a goal within the first ten minutes, it looked like their struggles were due to continue in Munich. But Naldo (center) came to the rescue, bouncing in a free kick that put Schalke level with the defending Bundesliga champions in the first half. Schalke\\'s defense took it from there, holding off Bayern to earn a valuable point away from home. Adam Szalai (left) has not done spectacularly well since leaving Mainz in 2013, but he did have a spectacular game off the bench for Hoffenheim. The Hungarian forward scored two goals against his former club to top off a fantastic rebound performance for Hoffenheim, who lost their first game of the season last week against RB Leipzig. It only took 59 seconds until Berlin took the lead against Ingolstadt on Saturday. Genki Haraguchi smashed a pass from Salamon Kalou into the back of the net, which left Martin Hansen (middle left) in a state of dismay. It was the only goal Hertha needed to secure their first win of 2017. Cologne have lost just once this season when Anthony Modeste has scored. His goal, the only goal in Cologne\\'s 1-0 win over Wolfsburg, came from the penalty spot after the French forward drew a penalty from a misguided dive from Diego Benaglio. It was his 15th goal of the season as he continues to move up the goalscoring chart. It took 73 minutes for Borussia M?nchengladbach to get their motor running, but it roared pretty loud when it kicked into gear. Gladbach scored their three goals in 15 minutes at the end of their contest with Freiburg, Raffael getting the first. Their 3-0 result was the second time this season in which Gladbach have scored three goals in the second half. Kyriakos Papadopoulos (second from left) may be a defender wearing a striker\\'s number (No. 9). But he earned his kit number after a game-winning goal against his former club Bayer Leverkusen - from which he is on loan. The goal gave Hamburg their fourth win in seven Bundesliga games. RB Leipzig shocked Borussia Dortmund in their first ever Bundesliga home game last September with a 1-0 victory. Dortmund did the shocking this time, upsetting the second-placed Red Bulls with a 1-0 victory. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang headed in the game\\'s only goal, his 17th of the season - in as many Bundesliga starts. Augsburg came from behind twice to secure a thrilling 3-2 victory over Werder Bremen. An entertaining and open game looked to be heading for a draw when Koo equalized with ten minutes to go. But Raul Bobadilla (pictured left) crowned a highly-impressive individual performance with the winning goal deep into stoppage time. Eintracht Frankfurt were made to work very hard for a 2-0 win over bottom-club Darmstadt in the Hesse derby. A second-half penalty by Makoto Hasebe (pictured) finally broke the deadlock before Rebic killed the game off late on. The win takes Frankfurt up to third and firmly in the race for the Champions League. Author: Davis Van Opdorp, Rob Turner'],\n",
       " ['Beavers on the rampage Beavers were almost completely wiped out of Germany by the early 20th century. Now, they\\'ve made a comeback. But their busy construction work is causing tensions with human neighbors. Few animals create such impressive structures or alter their environment so dramatically as the beaver. Few, except for humankind. \"Beavers are like the architects of our waterways,\"-says of Iris Barthel of German conservation group Nabu. \"They build dams, burrow, gnaw and fell trees and shrubs. In this way, beavers have shaped our riverscapes for millions of years.\" But despite - and sometimes because of - a shared propensity for reshaping the landscape, humans and beavers don\"t always make good neighbors. By the early 20th century, humans had hunted the Eurasian beaver - prized for its meat and warm, dense pelt --almost to extinction. In Germany, a few animals survived in pockets on the Elbe river. More recently, protection of the species and reintroduction programs have seen beaver numbers bounce back. Today there are around 30,000 in Germany, with strongholds in east Germany, as well as parts of Bavaria, on the Upper Rhine and the southwest of North-Rhine Westphalia. After a long absence, the hefty rodents-- with their unmistakable flat tails and blunt snouts . became, if not a common sight, at least something you might be lucky enough to glimpse on a German riverbank. Still, beavers are shy, and anyone looking for signs of their presence along the Rhine or Elbe might do better to look out for a beaver\\'s dam, or the stumps of trees felled by gnawing. Beaver dams are hard to miss Beaver-made flooding Some riverside residents, however,-don\\'t have to go out looking for traces of beaver activity. Just as manmade dams can be disaster for the habitat of other animals, so some Germans have found their own homes flooded by beaver-made reservoirs. One homeowner who found the foundations of his house in German city of J¨¹lich threatened by rising water levels from a beaver dam told local broadcaster Westdeutscher Rundfunk: \"They don\"t belong here in the middle of the city. We\\'r not an open-air zoo.\" Nabu says conflict usually occurs when farms or gardens extend right up to the river bank-or where the natural floodplain is altered. \"The beavers aren\"t aware of property ownership. They see the riverbank as a place they can dig their burrow,\"-says Barthel. \"They see tasty food in fields or orchards. So it can happen that a tractor breaks a beaver lodge or a beaver fells a favorite apple tree.\" She adds that beavers have been accused of burrowing into dams and dikes, disrupting manmade flood defences, but says there are well-practiced defenses against this kind of damage. \"If beavers are pilloried by politicians, it\\'s primarily to distract from their own failures in flood prevention,\"-says Barthel. Beavers are landscape architects - something humans hold against them Warming beaver-human relations Biologist Jessica Dieckmann told DW that part of her role as newly-appointed commissioner on beavers for the German city of Hamm was to help deal with conflicts arising between homeowners and their beaver neighbors. She explained that because injuring or killing beavers or damaging their dams and burrows is forbidden in German, \"A solution has to be found tactfully.\"?\"A solution could be that landowners sell a 20-meter-wide (66-foot-wide) riparian strip and make it available for nature protection,\"-says Dieckmann. Her other tasks as beaver commissioner include finding out whereabouts beavers are in Hamm and how many there are, to know how best to deal with the creatures in the future. Beavers usually live in burrows in the river bank accessed by an underwater tunnel. The dam ensures the water is deep enough to hide the entrance to their \"lodge\"-beneath the surface. But while human construction often runs at complete odds with the needs of other living species, beaver dams bring benefits to a whole host of other species. \"They create small ponds, deadwood, marsh areas-or open up areas of soil,\"-says Barthel. These provide habitats for dragonflies, amphibians and reptiles, for fish and birds. \"Where humans have to spend a lot of money on preserving biodiversity, the beaver helps out for free.\" \"At the same time, it contributes to the cleanliness of water, re-natures rivers and supports natural flood prevention.\"'],\n",
       " ['Conductor Simone Young: \\'Germans adore a good discussion\\' One of the first internationally successful female conductors explains how working in Germany can be initially frustrating but very rewarding in the long term - and why so few German women conductors have emerged.- The American Marin Alsop, the Mexican Alondra de la Parra, the Lithuanian Mirga Gra?inyt?-Tyla and the Estonian Anu Tali have been stirring up excitement in the world of classical music in the past few years. But one of the first to crack the glass ceiling in this male-dominated profession is the Australian Simone Young. She\\'s been professionally active in Germany for over 30 years, including 10 years as General Music Director and Opera Director in Hamburg. For the past year and a half, she\\'s been a freelance conductor, and is in demand worldwide.- Deutsche Welle: DW is soon to start a German-language television program with cultural and arts content. What do you think of that? Simone Young: I\\'m surprised it doesn\\'t already exist. If I find myself in a train in England or America for example, and people are speaking German nearby, I can never resist the temptation to get involved in the conversation. Invariably, the internationally mobile Germans have a keen interest in culture. As a director of an opera house, you may have noticed, like I, that foreign critics are much kinder to new productions than German critics are. What does that say about Germans and their attitude towards the arts? It has a lot to do with the fact the arts take a very central position in life in Germany, in a way that they don\\'t, for example, in the English speaking world. Here productions are expected to have a political commentary on current situations, or otherwise be socially relevant. A German critic comes to the performance with the expectation of being challenged, and of finding program notes revealing-what was on the mind of the director. I applaud the idea that the arts should say something about humanity\\'s current situation, that they remain alive and current and relevant, but dislike the kind of intellectual snobbishness that goes with some of this. Extrapolating on this, and drawing on your experience of working in-German speaking lands, what would you say is the essence of being German? I think it\\'s changing, but something I have always found fascinating about the Germans is that they are very politically conversant. I remember that in Australia, where I was born, you didn\\'t talk about religion or politics in polite company! But when I first came to Germany, I was delighted and at the same time shocked by how readily my contemporaries would get into heavy conversations about politics - or about religion for that matter. I eventually realized that the idea of giving voice to your opinion is something that is very actively developed in Germany. Now, not every opinion is worth listening to. And there still is a sense here that everyone says their piece, and the one who says it loudest gets listened to. But I applaud a society that is as politically aware and as self-critical as this one. - This production of Borodin\\'s \"Prince Igor\" from 2012 falls within Young\\'s tenure as director of the Hamburg State opera What are the kinds of messages and values that you think should be projected from Germany to the rest of the world? Or is there even a need for that? I think there is more and more a need for that. Let\\'s put it bluntly: both with Brexit in the UK and Trump in America, I think we\\'re moving into a time when countries are becoming very focused on their own needs and desires in a very selfishly inward-looking way, like: we\\'ll deal with the rest of the world later. Germany carries with it, of course, the legacy and the guilt of the 20th century, and as such continues to engage with the world outside in a way that acknowledges the debts that contemporary Germany has to the rest of the world. Of course, I move in liberal circles, in that in the operatic, the symphonic, the arts world in general, you\\'re dealing with a generally high level of education and social awareness. So I am in a little bit of a bubble. - Maybe everybody\\'s in a bubble in this increasingly polarized world.

       " ['Pooh the bionic cat gets back on all fours When Bulgarian stray Pooh lost his hind legs in a road accident, it seemed he would never be back on his paws again. Now, after veterinary surgeons tried out a groundbreaking procedure, he can run and even jump again. One-year-old stray Pooh is back on all fours after groundbreaking surgery carried out for the first time in continental Europe. The black-and-white feline is thought to have lost his hind legs in a mishap involving either a car or train in April last year. Pooh-and another cat, Stiven, were taken to Sofia\\'s Central Vet Clinic by the animal charity-Let\\'s Adopt Bulgaria. Veterinary surgeon Vladislav Zlatinov is the first vet in Europe to have success in applying the pioneering method of Irish neuro-orthopaedic surgeon Noel Fitzpatrick, who carried out a similar operation in Britain. Zlatinov scanned relevant papers in scientific journals to prepare for the procedure, but without any commercial implants available, he had to have some parts custom-built. The titanium stem joins the bone and can be attached to swappable prosthetic limbs When the complex surgery was completed, Pooh had a pair of titanium legs implanted into his body. These can then be connected to external prostheses which can be changed like shoes. Pooh, whose name means \"fluff\" in Bulgarian, can move pretty well considering the circumstances,-chasing toy mice and fully exploring his new environment. He can even jump up for toys. \"We\\'re very proud,\" said Zlatinov. \"It was quite a success ... It gives hope to other patients.\" \"Cats who lost one leg do pretty well. But what happens if they lose both their hind legs? Yes, they move somehow, but what quality of life are we talking about?\" he said. Better than a life on wheels Until Pooh\\'s skin grows over the bone and stem enough to be sure there is no infection, veterinary staff are still supervising his recovery closely. Other than that, the only thing that\\'s different to before is a tiny tapping sound whenever his polymer and rubber paws hit the floor. It\\'s the sort of independence that the normal solution - a set of wheels - would never have offered. Staff at the clinic are looking for a new home for Pooh, and there have already been several applicants. Since Pooh\\'s operation, Zlatinov has carried out the procedure on a number of other cats including Stiven, who was also said to be doing well. (AP, AFP, Reuters)'],\n",
       " ['Online vs offline shopping: which is better for the environment? Is buying something with the click of a mouse worse for the planet than picking it up off the shelf and taking it home yourself? And if it is - would it change the way you shopped? Would you avoid shopping online if you thought that would help the environment? That\\'s what Germany\\'s environment minister Barbara Hendricks does. She recently told German newspaper Bild am Sonntag that she refuses to buy anything over the internet because it results in too much packaging waste. But is buying online really more damaging for the environment than heading into a bricks-and-mortar shop? Packaging overkill? Hendricks told the newspaper: \"Ordering goods over the internet is a big problem regarding rubbish. Also, in some cities nowadays, more and more food is delivered by ordering online. There are also increasing numbers of single-person households. That means that more ready meals and smaller portions are being bought. That leads to a lot of packaging waste.\" Shopping online in many countries around the globe is growing fast---in the US, market analysts have predicted that between 2013 and 2018, online grocery sales alone will grow annually at an average of 21.1 per cent, according to Packaging World Magazine. Offline grocery sales are expected to rise by a mere 3.1 per cent on average annually during the same period. Packaging - customers want just enough for their product to arrive intact But while consumers may complain about their online-ordered products-arriving wrapped in excessive packaging, they don\"t want their goods to reach them damaged, either. Some businesses are trying to minimize the environmental footprint by using recyclable materials in their packaging. For instance, Ecovative\\'s mushroom-based packaging made from mycelium --the root-like structure of mushrooms --is biodegradable. Others, including Amazon, have started using new box-making technology that enables them to customize packaging based on the exact size of the product being shipped, helping reduce overpackaging. Professor Gerrit Heinemann, head of the eWeb Research Center at the Hochschule Niederrhein University of Applied Sciences, told DW that while studies show that both online and offline shopping are similar in how eco-friendly they are, they showed that buying over the internet has the edge. He explained: \"With online shopping, the packaging is more environmentally-friendly than the plastic bags you have in shops.\"  More people are switching from shopping high streets to buying online The carbon footprint Transport also has to be factored in when trying to weigh up online and offline shopping\\'s green credentials. The carbon footprint generated while shopping can depend a lot on where someone lives, what method of transport is used and how close the nearest store is. A-shopper in the bike-friendly Netherlands heading to a nearby store will likely yield lower carbon emissions per person than a motorist-travelling half-an-hour to a store in the US-Midwest, where people rely more on their cars. Also, whether you go shopping alone or with others, or buy one item or several can also affect the carbon footprint. A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2013 found that the further away someone lived from a store and the less efficient the method of transport, then the more eco-friendly it would be to buy online. The paper found that offline shoppers have a carbon footprint almost twice that of online shoppers who never go inside a physical store. Traditional shoppers may make several trips to the store to find out more about the product, compare prices, and finally buy the product, whereas online shoppers can do all of this without leaving the comfort of their homes. But carbon can be added onto online purchases in other ways - for instance, picking up items after a failed delivery or from a click-and-collect point, or returning unwanted items. \"Showrooming\"-- trying out products in person at a bricks-and-mortar store before buying online --stands out as being a particularly environmentally-unfriendly way of shopping. Opting for fast delivery also poses environmental problems: same-day delivery and tight delivery slots make-it more difficult for the delivery firms to combine shipments to the same neighborhood. That means a larger distance driven per item. Shopping in a physical store can mean more eco-unfriendly packaging with plastic bags What can consumers and companies do? Both online and offline shopping can be done in eco-friendlier ways. For buying on the internet, consumers should avoid next-day or same-day delivery, and where an eco-friendly packaging option exists, plump for it wherever possible. If consumers need to visit a physical store, then coordinating shopping trips with other errands, buying in bulk rather just a few items and doing the trip with others will help. Cycling or walking to the nearest store is of course going to be better for the environment than driving to a shop just for a carton of milk --and if a car is used, then buying a lot of stuff at one time will be better than buying single items from an e-retailer. For their part, bricks-and-mortar stores could provide more information online so that customers make better-informed purchase decisions, and could also encourage customers to pick up their online orders at stores located in dense urban areas.  Online and offline shopping are similar on eco-friendliness - but online \\'has the edge\\' Professor Heinemann told DW that improving efficiency on the so-called \"last mile\" --the point of delivery to the household --could boost online shopping\\'s green credentials. \"The question is, why do we have so many delivery services, such as DHL, UPS etc, which all deliver small amounts, rather than bundling them?\"-he said. \"Amazon is already preparing hubs - they have just announced they will build their own airport, so they will take over their own deliveries and will be able to bundle them.-In California, there are already a-lot of pick-up stations-where you can pick up food. In universities you can pick up books-from Amazon.\" Professor Heinemann also recommended that customers change their buying behavior. \"The biggest part of retail is food, and the average purchase-in Germany-is-only-11 euro,\"-he told DW, saying that if people bought double as much each time they went shopping, \"it would mean 50 per cent less drives to the store and-that-would-have the biggest impact on the environment.\" But ultimately, rather than impulse-buying, thinking-about whether you really need the product at all could prove the most environmentally-friendly step-of all.'],\n",

       " ['#HowGreenAmI: Is a life without palm oil possible? Palm oil is practically everywhere, whether it be food, cosmetics or gasoline. And it is not always easy to identify. So I decided to understand this ubiquitous stuff better. Turns out, I was naive. In the beginning, I have to admit, my approach to the subject was naive. \"Clearly, palm oil is something I\\'ve heard of before,\" I said, \"it\\'s a product of the oil palm tree. Perhaps it is similar to coconut fat, maybe olive oil, it\\'s most likely used for cooking.\" And I assumed that I would learn a lot about this fat relatively quickly. Boy, I was wrong. Avoiding it would be quite a challenge. And that was exactly my task. A few days later I had read a few articles, scanned websites of environmental organizations, and watched YouTube videos on the subject and was quite surprised by what I had found. What had I gotten into? The stuff was everywhere. In food. Not only in Nutella, but also in pretzels, soup, chocolate, biscuits, muesli or margarine. Cosmetics were also full of it. And because palm oil is often used in animal feed, every sausage I would buy was probably, at least indirectly, a palm oil product. And what about gasoline? I had assumed that it contained mainly rape oil, but no: most of it is palm oil. \"I need someone to help me understand this oily business,\" I thought. To make things even more complicated, I found out that there\\'s something called \"green palm oil,\" a certified, perhaps sustainable variant of palm oil. Would that be the solution? Could I use that without remorse? Obviously not, several sources stated. For \"green\" is often nothing more than a smoke screen to cover up environmental destruction. Because for palm oil, rainforest is cut down on a huge scale to make way for monocultures, which can meet the huge demand worldwide. Huge, of course, because palm oil is in everything. Monday I started to turn my kitchen and bathroom upside down. I wanted to understand how bad my behavior really was. But it\\'s actually impossible to study the list of ingredients of each and every product I have at home. What I understood was that companies rarely use the term \"palm oil.\" Instead, they use technical terms or complicated names for something that could be anything. But palm oil? In the best case it said that some \"vegetable fats\" were included. Then, however, I struck lucky. While reading about palm oil, I came across an app that might help, I hoped: Codecheck. If you use this app to scan the barcodes of products, it spits out all sorts of information on ingredients, including palm oil. Tuesday The core of the Codecheck app is a database, which is continually updated by the app\\'s users, but also with data coming from environmental groups, Franziska Grammes of Codecheck explained to me. In addition, I learned how the rating system works, which allows the user to see if a particular product is good for them or not: To my surprise, I found almost no food product in my household containing palm oil. However, it was quite common in our cosmetics. Codecheck also distinguishes between good and bad palm oil. Good means \"certified.\" This certification is the main contentious issue in the discussion about palm oil. There are different ways to assess palm oil, all of which want to prove that the oil is produced sustainably. However, there is probably no perfect way to prove sustainability, because too many parameters have an impact on production: Is the palm oil produced in a monoculture, or does the rain forest remain untouched? Which fertilizers are used to which extent? Are pesticides used? Do different production standards apply to different markets? And what are farmers getting out of it? Can they make a living growing this crop? The best known and most controversial approach is certification according to the RSPO, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, which was launched by the conservation group WWF. Most of the main players in the market, including supermarket chains, use this certification process. Palm oil, which has been certified according to the RSPO, is supposed to fulfill certain conditions, says the WWF. Wednesday Critics, however, see the requirements as too lax. The system isn\\'t perfect yet, the WWF\\'s Ilka Peterson admits during our conversation. But as the organisation\\'s palm oil expert, she says the certification standard is an important step to build upon. The demand for palm oil has doubled over the past ten years. One in two products in an average German supermarket contain the oil. And Germany and Europe are not even the main markets. India and Indonesia consume the most palm oil per year, 10.4 and 9.1 million tons respectively. The EU as a whole uses less than 6.5 million tons. \"But wouldn\\'t it be possible to replace palm oil in Europe with another, native oil?\", I asked. It is not that easy, Ilka Peterson said. \"We just do not have enough space here.\" Thursday This is a statement that Sven Selbert simply can\\'t subscribe to. The expert for tropical forests works for the conservation group Robin Wood. He has a clear idea of how a switch to rape could work. The crux is the massive use of fertilizers in the cultivation of oil palm trees, he says. Without them, the high yield of four tons per hectare wouldn\\'t be possible and the yield shrinks to the level of rape. This in turn would make the switch to rape potentially viable. In addition, land has to be freed up. And this could be done if we finally stopped burning precious oil for fuel. For me, there is no issue when it comes to palm oil in gasoline. The simple reason is: I barely drive. I can simply choose not to consume palm oil as gasoline. But many others do. And driving is responsible for a large, if not the largest chunk of palm oil consumption in Europe. With that in mind, it seems impossible to produce all the oil we need- in a way that can be certified as sustainable. Another problem is the existence of different standards, says Robin Wood. Standards applied in Europe, for example, don\\'t automatically apply in other regions of the world. Instead, the producers make palm oil for the European market sustainably, but not for markets in the rest of the world. And the rest of the world consumes substantially more palm oil than Europe. For my project, Robin Wood is the counterpart to the WWF. In the end, both organizations are pulling together for the greater good, to make palm oil more environmentally friendly. Even if one organisation criticizes the other, both say that it is up to us consumers to become active now. If we actively demand alternatives, if we start buying palm oil-free products, and if we make it clear to producers that we take nature conservation seriously, then something can change. Friday Next for my experiment, Martina Bacher finally gets on board. She runs the website Umweltblick.de and has put together a shopping guide which gives consumers the power to fight the mainstream by showing them alternatives to palm oil. Starting in late 2014, food that contains palm oil needs to say so in Germany, says Martina Bacher. Cosmetics and cleaning products still don\\'t need to be labelled. This is one reason why she developed her list and keeps it up-to-date. It is supposed to be a kind of map through the jungle of ingredients. Our conversation brings my week-long experiment to a close. I have not lived completely without palm oil, but I have realized what I am doing, what kinds of products I buy and what I have to look out for. I have learned that it is sometimes hard to recognize palm oil. I have learned that there are certainly efforts to give the sought-after oil a push towards a more sustainable future. Of course, this road is long, and which way we are headed probably depends too much on the profits that palm oil promises companies today. But I also learned that I\\'m doing pretty well right now, when it comes to palm oil. I rarely use cars, I cook my food at home almost every day and know exactly what kind of ingredients I used (certainly not palm oil). When it comes to cosmetics I always avoid stuff from ordinary drugstores and I eat very little meat. But do I live a life without palm oil? No, I don\\'t. But perhaps life does not need to be entirely palm oil-free. We, as consumers, must be aware of the impact our consumption has on nature. We must adjust accordingly. And if we want less monoculture and less virgin forest to be cleared for palm oil plantations, then we should just make sure that we don\\'t buy products that contain palm oil. And in doing so, the information and impulses that my conversation partners have given can provide some very useful assistance.'],\n",

Recent images from the European Space Agency's Mars Express satellite offer a new perspective to the ice cap on the planet's north pole. Using 32 separate shots collected over a six-year period, the images show dark, spiraling troughs cutting up a million square kilometers of ice-covered terrain. The ice cap and its swirling appearance is believed to have formed when strong winds from the planet's elevated center blew towards the pole and circled in a similar fashion to hurricane spirals on Earth.- Although the ice cap is permanent throughout the year, the winter months can mean up to 30 percent of the planet's atmospheric carbon dioxide precipitates and adds an additional meter of ice to the pole. This adds to the predominantly frozen water and dust on the planet's surface.- When the ice falls on the terrain, it highlights the numerous canyons in the region, including the Chasma Boreale.

       " ['Influential painter Neo Rauch revealed in new documentary He\\'s one of Europe\\'s most successful contemporary artists. The documentary \"Neo Rauch - Gef?hrten und Begleiter\" by Nicola Graef offers insights into the life of the media-shy star of the New Leipzig School. Television journalist and director Nicola Graef accompanied the world-renowned painter Neo Rauch for three years with her film camera and microphone-to make the film \"Neo Rauch - Gef?hrten und Begleiter\"-(loosely translated as \"Neo Rauch - Comrade and Companion\").- What she discovered was an extremely modest person who goes to his studio every day at the same time, just like a laborer punching the clock. \"Nothing whizzes past him,\" Graef said in an interview with DW. \"You notice that in the way he works. He is a very concentrated person who completely focuses on things.\" It doesn\\'t bother him when someone watches him work. He has none of the airs some artists have, none of the vanities. Only when he can\\'t move a heavy canvas will Rauch show his irritation on camera, but it\\'s short-lived. There\\'s an-admirable-calm about him - and does not allow himself to be deterred, loyal to-his typical style of socialist realism of the Leipzig School. A foreign world His large-scale canvases are inhabited by enigmatic characters, eerie scenes and dark fantasy-like figures. He paints what\\'s in his head, further develops his idiosyncratic style, goes through phases of employing different colors, stoically and unwaveringly. Rauch\\'s images are enigmatic and unusual Collectors from around the world vie with each other to buy his paintings, and his exhibitions are usually sold-out events. That disconcerts Rauch, and that\\'s also what makes him so unbelievably likeable, said Graef. The whole picture Neo Rauch as a person takes center stage in Graef\\'s documentary: as a painter, an artist colleague, a father, the husband of successful painter Rosa Loy, as a friend of Harry Lybke, the gallery owner who represents him, and as a friendly conversation partner to collectors and other art lovers. The film takes us on an amazing journey of discovery: What characterizes this unique global phenomenon that is Neo Rauch? What are the artistic roots of his unconventional painting? Why is he so calm and collected, despite his international fame? For the first time in years, Rauch speaks in front of the camera about these topics, but also about the wounds and emotional chasms that have preoccupied him all his life. Filling the void Neo Rauch was born on April 18, 1960 in Leipzig. He grew up with his grandparents, after losing his parents in a tragic train accident when he was just four weeks old. \"He has felt that void his entire life,\" Graef noted. \"Since he is such an extremely sensitive person, all of that emotion is laid bare. And you can see that in his pictures.\" The artist studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in his hometown of Leipzig, and the school became his artistic homeland. As of 1986, he was a master student under and later assistant to Arno Rink. Those experiences had a profound effect on the young student. Rauch with his wife Rosa Loy, also a painter, in front of his work \"Kalimuna\" His apocalyptically inhabited works made a fast splash in the art world and, early on in his career, were shown at major museums in Basel, Maastricht, Munich and New York. He became famous quickly, his pictures taking their place in private and public collections. From 2005 to 2009, he was a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Leipzig. That was an important part of his life that meant a lot to him, noted Graef.- His own cosmos As a painter, Rauch maintains the down-to-earth manner typical of eastern Germany and stays loyal to his style, his friends and his hometown - and to gallery owner, Harry Lybke, who has represented him all these years. All of them accept him the way he wants to be. \"He is someone who permeates everything. That\\'s why he\\'s in his own cosmos - in himself, in his painting, in his studio,\" said director Graef, reflecting on filming with the artist. \"That\\'s why you sometimes get the feeling that he\\'s not of this world. But maybe that\\'s also why his pictures are so powerful.\" Her documentary gives viewers a glimpse into the world of thought behind Neo Rauch\\'s pictures. It\\'s a strong film, its images shot with sensitivity and arranged in an entertaining manner. It hits movie theaters on March 2, 2017. The gallery below revisits some of the most important artists of the Leipzig-School. Neo Rauch, 55, is regarded as one of the most important contemporary German painters. His large-format works and graphics have a surreal feel, a trademark of the Leipzig-born artist\\'s style. Rauch\\'s paintings conquered the art market in the 1990s. Gerd Harry Lybke (pictured here with Rauch), the Leipzig art dealer who signed Rauch and other artists after reunification, was an important mediator for the new movement. Lybke has a colorful history: his gallery was under observation by the East German secret Police: the much feared Stasi. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Leipzig became a center for contemporary art once again. Neo Rauch was actually the movement\\'s only native East German, while Tim Eitel, Rosa Loy and David Schnell (pictured) were West German. The name stuck, however, and New Leipzig School works became immensely popular. Tim Eitel\\'s figurative paintings hang in many private collections around the world. His connection with the New Leipzig School helped him to fame. Often based on newspaper clippings or photographs, his works comment on our society. Arno Rink,75, studied at the Leipzig Academy for Visual Arts, and he also taught at the academy in the early 1970s. His early works are influenced by Picasso, Dix and Beckmann, and many echo mythical themes. Rink is the link between East Germany\\'s Leipzig School and today\\'s New Leipzig School. In terms of a specific genre, the Leipzig School didn\\'t really exist. The name evolved when several painters from Leipzig - Bernhard Heisig (pictured), Wolfgang Mattheuer and Werner T¨¹bke - were invited to the documenta 6 exhibition in 1977. These artists had increasingly moved away from State-sanctioned art and socialist realism from the 1960s. The trio was labeled the \"artistic miracle\" of the East. Werner T¨¹bke - regarded as a Traditionalist and a critical realist - was famous in East Germany for numerous large scale wall paintings. His works disappeared after reunification. Wolfgang Mattheuer used strong images from ancient mythology in his works, that often focused on the fears and desires harbored by his fellow East Germans. Like the other Leipzig painters, Mattheuer wouldn\\'t be silenced by East German authorities. The artists also didn\\'t want to belong to a \"School,\" and refused the label Leipzig School.

Well the best example I can give you about a space innovation is this: Perhaps you have a mobile phone with a fruit on it [Ed.: We think he means an Apple iPhone]\"?and perhaps the casing is made of glass metal. That\\'s a technical term. And metal glasses were actually developed in space, on the Space Shuttle, in the 1980s. NASA patented the procedure and the production method, and only now - 20 or 30 years later - this invention is in our pockets, as you said. Let\\'s look into the future now, because you\\'ve spoken a bit about the moon and the plans for a Moon Village. What is about the moon that fascinates you? The moon is fascinating because it\\'s there. Everyone knows it and sees it, and we can learn so much on the moon. We can use the moon as a base for astronomy. The moon\\'s atmosphere absorbs certain wavelengths that we cannot see on Earth, so that\\'s really important. But we can also learn about the moon itself. The moon is a dead body, so we can learn about the history of Earth and how our solar system evolved. These are data that scientists need to accurately predict where in the universe we can find live. But while you say you wouldn\\'t take a one-way ticket to Mars, would you spend an extended period of time on the moon? Definitely, definitely. Now when we travel to the ISS we spend six months there, or even 12 months, and I believe a similar amount of time on the moon is absolutely feasible. So when do you think is the next most realistic opportunity for you to be in space? With Gerst\\'s mission as ISS Commander in 2018, you probably won\\'t make that because all the seats have been reserved. So when is a realistic time? Currently we have Thomas Pesquet in space. Later in the year we will have another European astronaut, Paolo Nespoli flying, in 2018 Alexander Gerst, and in 2019 it\\'s Luca Parmitano. On average we have one flight per year. So the next free flight is 2020. But there are other astronauts who are looking to take that seat - not only me. When you say \"one flight per year\"?you mean for European astronauts\"? Yes. It\\'s one flight per year on average for European astronauts to the ISS. But there are also new opportunities, like the Chinese space station which will be ready by 2022. We are working towards a cooperation with the Chinese, although that still needs to be established. That\\'s an exciting development, isn\\'t it? It is absolutely exciting. And I think it\\'s an excellent way to show how spaceflight actually brings people and the world together. It\\'s also a very good thing in politically uncertain times to have spaceflight cooperation because that unites people and always builds a base.- Matthias Maurer-is the newest recruit to the European Space Agency\\'s astronaut corps. He has a doctorate (PhD) in materials science engineering and holds more than 10 patent applications, with half being international registrations. -'],\n",
       " ['Poland debates approach to new World War II museum The World War II museum\\'s construction and exhibition are more or less finished, but the Polish government said it\\'s not \"national\" enough. A court decision has kept the director in his post and could save the museum. Museum director Pawel Machcewicz had just struck a pose for a farewell photo. Fans of the museum had placed a symbolic barrier in front of the museum gates - with the aim, they said, of warding off \"attacks on cultural institutions.\" Then, suddenly-came the good news from the courts in Warsaw: The director did not have to vacate his post, as feared, on February 1, and the museum could continue on its mission. These are the latest scenes from the combative drama concerning the prestigious Museum of the Second World War in Poland. World War II began in Gdansk. Summit conferences to recall the war have regularly occured in the Polish port on the Baltic Sea. So in 2008, the Polish government - at the time led by Donald Tusk, who hails from Gdansk - thought it was high time to build a major museum there. And that is precisely part of the problem: The new, conservative government of the Law and Justive Party (PiS) has criticized the entire concept, aiming to massively alter the nearly completed museum and oust founding director Machcewicz after eight years of work. One of the largest cultural investments after 1989 Pawel Machcewicz laying the cornerstone of the museum in 2012 Yet it\\'s been a labor of love by the distinguished historian Machcewicz and his team - and one of the largest cultural investments in Poland since 1989, with the new building tagged at 104-million euros ($111-million). The architecture, created by the firm Kwadrat,-is grabbing - soaring up at an angle of 56 degrees. The collection includes everything from battle tanks to family keepsakes and the ship bell of the \"Wilhelm Gustloff\" that sank in 1945 carrying refugees. The many items of the collection and those on loan illustrate war and occupation, everyday life and resistance from across Europe. The museum focus is intended to be on the fate of the civilian population as, according to Machcewicz, Poland lost five million civilians and 200,000 soldiers in the war. A catalogue, in Polish and English, has also already been completed. Just as the museum was nearly finished, critics reared their heads. Piotr Glinski, culture minister of Poland\\'s conservative government, demanded three different appraisal reports - all of which came to the conclusion that too much emphasis was being placed on the \"human misfortune\" of the war while \"people\\'s inurement \" as the result of the war was being ignored. One of the appraisers, conservative historian Jan Zaryn, wrote that the museum\\'s approach bespeaks \"pseudo-universalism.\" More attention should have paid to Poland itself and its \"freedom-loving,\" proud population, he said. In addition, he noted construction deficits in the building. Court orders stop to compulsory museum merger- As a result, Minister Glinski called for the museum to merge with another institution, which is not really a museum at all, but more of a relatively tiny memorial to the Battle of Westerplatte. This was the-first battle of the war in September 1939,-where Polish soldiers were able to put up the greatest resistance to the Nazi Wehrmacht. The dramatic building features a 56-degree tilt Such a move would be-a-way for the government to oust Machcewicz and redesign-the museum. However, a Warsaw court ordered an injunction to stop the compulsory merger, a decision that was-reconfirmed earlier this week. The culture ministry plans to appeal the outcome. The city of Gdansk, which itself has a liberal-led government, has supported Machcewicz and the museum\\'s other founders. Following the submission of more than 1,000 petitions, Adam Bodnar, Poland\\'s official spokesman for civil liberties, has also responded. He criticized the aimed merger of the museums as it transgresses the law governing cultural activities: The hasty construction of the Westerplatte Museum, which would then \"merge\" with the Museum of the Second World War, would not be a prudent approach to dealing with budget funds, which the government is required to uphold, he said. Furthermore, he added that the minister\\'s methods were an impermissible intrusion into a municipality\\'s competencies. Machcewicz, for his part, is relieved following the latest court decision. He has set his sights on the beginning of March for the museum\\'s opening and then, \"everyone can form their own opinions,\" said the strident director. For now, a final verdict on the matter is not realistically expected for another two to three months. -'],\n",
       " ['Why the world is turning to Hannah Arendt to explain Trump George Orwell\\'s \"1984\" is not the only classic that\\'s celebrating a comeback. Hannah Arendt\\'s philosophical essay \"The Origins of Totalitarianism\" has also spiked in interest recently. Here\\'s why it\\'s so relevant. Born in Germany to a Jewish family, Hannah Arendt (1906-1975) fled when Adolf Hitler rose to power in 1933. She spent time as a stateless refugee in France-and was deported to an internment camp under the Vichy regime. She emigrated to the United States in 1941, later becoming a US citizen. Having experienced first-hand the near collapse of an advanced civilization, she also became one of the first political theorists to analyze how totalitarian political movements could rise in the early-20th century. The roots of Nazism and Stalinism are described in her first major book, \"The Origins of Totalitarianism,\" originally published in English in 1951. It has been compulsory reading for many college students ever since, but the dense political work of over 500 pages isn\\'t typically a bestseller. It has been flying off bookshelves in the US since Trump\\'s inauguration; Amazon even briefly ran out of stock this week. These new Arendt fans are presumably trying to understand what Trump\\'s presidency-could lead to. As it might take a while for readers to get through her heavy essays, here-are a few spoilers:-\"Trump is not a totalitarian in her understanding; he incorporates what she calls \\'elements\\' of totalitarianism,\"-Roger Berkowitz, professor and head of the Hannah Arendt Center for Politics and Humanity at Bard College in New York, explained-in a recent DW interview. However, strong warning signs shouldn\\'t be ignored, added-Berkowitz:-Arendt believed that-\"one of the core elements of totalitarianism is-that it\\'s based in a movement... and-Trump has explicitly called himself the mouthpiece of a movement. That\\'s a very dangerous position for a politician.\"-- Populism: easy fixes in times of global anxiety Arendt\\'s analysis focuses on the events of that period.-Although her observations-obviously couldn\\'t explain everything about-today\\'s complex political developments, many are still revealing even now, as-the right-wing populism that\\'s spreading throughout Europe and the US is reminiscent in different ways of the situation in the 1920s and 30s that allowed the Nazis and Communists to rise. Her books provide insight into the mechanisms that allow-so many people to readily-accept lies in times of global uncertainty. While major newspapers --from \"The New York Times\" to \"The Washington Post\" --are revisiting her writings, social media users are widely sharing quotes such as this one: \\'Fantastic statements\\' seen as-tactical cleverness In such a context, repeated, simplified --and false - storylines, which blame-scapegoats and offer-easy solutions, are-preferred over deeper analysis leading to informed opinions. This approach was applied by totalitarian leaders such as Hitler, Arendt wrote. In this sense, Trump\\'s strategy-of placing blanket blame-Muslims or Mexicans for terrorism, crime or unemployment,-and claiming that a travel ban or a wall will be an easy solution,-is not new. According to Arendt, totalitarian leaders at the beginning of the 20th century based their propaganda on this assumption: Trump has pushed this approach to new extremes; even though there are more fact-checkers than ever dedicated to exposing his blatant-lies, the president\\'s-cunning tactic is to discredit-these reports as coming from-the established, \"dishonest\" media. Meanwhile,-his movement\\'s beliefs are-backed by widely available-alternative sources.--  The \\'banality of evil\\' In Arendt\\'s-reporting on the 1961 trial of one of the major organizers of the Holocaust, Adolf Eichmann, she famously came up with the phrase \"the banality of evil\" to describe her view that evil might not be as radical as one might-expect. The resulting book, \"Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil,\" explains how crimes were committed through people who thoughtlessly obeyed orders to conform to the masses. The definition of thoughtlessness that she provided in a work first published in 1958, \"The Human Condition,\" could just as well have been written to describe President Trump\\'s hastily drawn executive orders and his struggles to justify them:-- Of course, such quotes taken out of context may be easy and comforting to share online, but they do not reflect the entirety of Arendt\\'s ideas. Similarly, those hoping to find all answers to \"The Origins of Totalitarianism\" are bound to-be disappointed.-Arendt didn\\'t pick that title herself --her publisher did. She believed the world was way too complex and messy to pinpoint the roots of totalitarianism, according to Berkowitz.- While revisiting her works, impossibly trying to predict if we\\'ll be overtaken by new forms of totalitarianism in the future, one can also find consolation in another of Arendt\\'s observations: She considered civil disobedience an essential part of the United States\\' political system - and-the country\\'s strong protest movements currently demonstrate this again. As she famously said:-'],\n",
       " ['Lady Gaga, Merkel and heretics meet in monumental artwork The sculptor Georg Korner aka Matthias K?rner has a liking for monumental projects. After spending 12 years recreating the faÃ§ade of the Berlin City Palace, his new artwork, \"Transit,\" is made up of 2,600 figures. The sculptor Georg Korner, whose real name is Matthias K?rner, spent many years working on the reconstruction of the baroque faÃ§ade of the Berlin City Palace. Since 2013, he\\'s also been preparing hundreds of figures that align into a monumental artwork called \"Transit.\" The work deals with transitions in life. DW: What inspired you to work on the concept of \"transit\"? Georg Korner:-Transit has been a subtext of my entire life. Three and a half years ago, I wanted to create a tableau of people rushing with their luggage. It only covered one-square meter at first, but it just kept developing ever since. I was looking for the right format, and I finally found it with this large installation. Which themes does the work deal with? There\\'s the transition between life and death, for example. The \"Catrinas\" [Eds. female figures of death] from the Mexican \"D¨ªa de los muertos,\" the day of the dead, which symbolically show up at the table of the living. They eat and dance together and then they disappear again. The installation also includes the heretics of the Spanish Inquisition, undergoing auto-da-f¨¦, the public penance imposed by its judges; soldiers blinded by lethal gas during World War I; and the Devil in Dante\\'s \"Divine Comedy\" from the early Renaissance. There\\'s Lady Gaga and Batman, too. They are the transitory heroes of our times. They\\'re also constantly reinventing themselves;-they\\'re on the move.------ You started on this piece before the refugee crisis reached its peak in Germany. Do you still see it as a comment on the current situation in the world? I rather dealt with the issue more generally - from the Exodus of the Jews out of Egypt to the expulsion of Armenians, from the migration of early populations to the flight of German Jews, Communists and intellectuals over France to America. We have continuously been confronted with this issue-over thousands of years - and it has always moved me. And then came the moment for me to create this work. Two years ago, there were the Charlie Hebdo attacks, and now suicide bombers are also included in the installation.- The work is obviously currently relevant and politically charged. When I think about the narcissist populist Trump, who ordered his travel ban on Muslims on Holocaust Remembrance Day-of all days, then I view my installation with completely new energy. The work was therefore transformed by current events? Exactly, it develops along the way. It also offers a tree of possibilities. I am working on a derived, smaller project-about Leni Riefenstahl and Arno Breker [Eds. She was a filmmaker and he was a sculptor best known for their Nazi propaganda works]. They were also people in transition, who on one hand wanted to make art, but on the other made art on command. Where will \"Transit\" be shown? I have recently said that it works pretty well here in my studio. It\\'ll come out of here one day, but we don\\'t know where it will land yet. -'],\n",
       " ['Salt poses threat to Senegal\\'s Sin¨¦ Saloum Delta wetlands In Senegal, seawater seeping into underground fresh water aquifers is slowly increasing soil salinity causing havoc for farming communities living near wetlands rich in biodiversity. Senegal\\'s Sin¨¦ Saloum Delta is a biodiversity hotspot. Just 180 kilometers south-east of Dakar, the UNESCO world heritage site covers some 180,000 hectares, comprising wetlands, lakes, lagoons and marshes, as well as sandy coasts and dunes, terrestrial savannah areas and dry, open forest. It\\'s home to 400 species and plays a vital role in flood control and regulating the distribution of rainwater for the local people and wildlife. Lack of fresh water But due to drought, climate change and the uncontrolled logging of mangrove forests, the ground\\'s salinity has shot up \"?threatening the livelihoods of thousands of people living there. One of them is Khadiome Ndongue, a resident of Sadio Ba near the west coast town of Foundiougne. Every day she draws water from a well in the community vegetable garden. The water from the well dug in 1988 has gradually turned salty over the last twenty years. During the dry season, in the wetland along the Saloum river, underground fresh water retreats, letting seawater in. This is known as saltwater intrusion - the movement of saline water into freshwater aquifers \"?making fresh water sources undrinkable. Sadio Ba village has had to abandon rice cultivation because of- this salination. \"The salt has caused a lot of damage in the fields. The scale of our agriculture is decreasing more and more because we don\\'t use the salted ground,\"?she said. Khadiome Ndongue relies on the well for water \"We can only use the arable land. Our yields are low and we have problems feeding families and selling our crops like before. Because of the salt we\\'ve abandoned the rice fields. Instead, we grow groundnuts, maize, and millet,\"?said Ndongue. A few years ago a visiting engineer suggested dropping bags of rice and millet husks, a fine inedible powder residue made from pounding grain,- into the well, in order to reduce salinity. It has worked, at least in the contained area of the well. Djigane Mboup, another villager, has taken up rearing chickens to make ends meet. \"Salt has really damaged our land. Before, you could earn 50,000 CFA francs (80 euro) from your crop. Now you\\'ll barely make 30,000 CFA. It\\'s been like that since 1999 or 2000. Last year was bad, but this year, it\\'s even worse,\"?he said. The Sin¨¦ Saloum Delta has been identified as the most important place in Senegal, and even in West Africa, for its population of bird species. The goliath heron, the great egret and the grey heron are a common sight. Uncontrolled logging of mangroves Sey¨¦ advises residents on dealing with salinification But climate change, drought, and the uncontrolled cutting of mangroves, a natural saltwater barrier, are increasing the salinity of the ground with huge impacts on the delta\\'s unique biosphere, says Ball¨¦ Seye, project manager at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). -- \"Mangrove forests help stop the advancement of salinisation in the crop fields,\"?said Seye. \"Now all these mangroves are just relics, destroyed. The result is that there\\'s a strong advance of salinisation in the fields and especially pastoral zones. No grass grows on this land ,so you can imagine the difficulties herders will have in a few years,\"?he said. To improve environmental conditions, the IUCN launched three pilot initiatives under the Ecosystems Protecting Infrastructure and Communities (EPIC) project, in six villages in Senegal. The first initiative was to develop ways to regulate the exploitation of forestry and fisheries. The second was to construct anti-salt barriers with local materials and lastly, to restore 90 hectares of forest to improve soil quality. Sadio Ba residents have built anti-salt barriers to retain humidity and keep salt water off the land. A new village forest Villagers were trained to grow a nursery of forestry species that can resist increased salt levels in the soil. In Sadio Ba village, 100 square metres of land have been fenced off so that trees can be planted, and will serve as a managed forest area. \"Here, the major difficulty for women is access to firewood. If there\\'s a village forest set up with rules, it will enable women in the long term and in the medium term to have wood for fuel for their consumption, and to replant at the same time,\"?said Seye. Around the world, wetlands continue to be drained and reclaimed for farming, as they are seen as a barrier to agriculture. According to the Ramsar Convention, while there is a need for more food production from land, the conversion of wetlands has far reaching impacts on their own ecosystem, and communities living off the ecosystem wetlands provide. World Wetlands Day is celebrated every year on 2 February. It marks the day the Convention on Wetlands was adopted in 1971, in the Iranian city of Ramsar. This year\\'s the theme is Wetlands for Disaster Risk Reduction highlighting the vital roles healthy wetlands play in reducing the impacts of extreme events, like floods. -'],\n",
       " ['The wetlands along the river Rhine struggle to recover from human engineering The Rhine River once curled and turned, flooding and receding to support a rich mosaic of forests, meadows and marshes. Straightening the river out has been disastrous for its wetlands. It\\'s a leisurely 9-kilometer (5.6-mile)-bike ride from the center of Karlsruhe in southwestern Germany to Rappenw?rt, where a narrow sliver of translucent green wetland lies nestled between the Rhine River and a raised earth embankment. \"It\\'s an original meander bed from when the Rhine still flowed in its natural course. It flowed in here in a giant loop,\" says Andreas Wolf, a biologist and head of the Nature Conservation Center Karlsruhe-Rappenw?rt, as he walks along the edge of the wetland, crunching over stones, shells and patches of ice. Now, in midwinter, the meander\\'s muddy bank is edged with bulbous canary grass and sedges, fallen tree trunks full of woodpecker holes and bare, straggly trees. But it\\'s these unspectacular-looking trees Wolf is excited about. Woodpecker holes hint at some of the life supported here, even in the depths of winter \"This is a white willow forest, a softwood forest. It\\'s an area that is often flooded, and the white willow can withstand up to 300 days a year with its feet in water,\" he explains, pointing to wide crowns which will burst into shimmering pale green foliage in spring. A number of thin saplings dot the bank - a great sign, says Wolf, that regular flooding is sweeping away undergrowth and bringing in the new sediment that white willows need-to germinate.- On the opposite side of the wetland, it\\'s a different story. In a copse of mature white willows, some around 20 meters high and 100 years old, there\\'s not a sapling in sight. \"When these trees fall down, that\\'s it,\" Wolf sighs. \"In principle, this wetland is connected to the Rhine, but because of the stone groin at the front, the current just doesn\\'t flow swiftly to create the flood dynamic needed.\" Fertile floodplains It\\'s the flow and ebb of the floods that made this area so special. Up until 200 years ago, the Rhine meandered, curled and inundated its way from its source in the Swiss Alps all the way to the Dutch-coast, where it empties into the North Sea. For several hundred kilometers downstream of the Swiss city of Basel, the course of the Rhine was particularly unpredictable. Here, in an area known as the Upper Rhine, which runs along the border between France and Germany, the river split into countless tributaries that looped through a giant rift valley bound by the Black Forest on one side and France\\'s Vosges-mountains on the other. Swollen by spring snow melts or summer rains, the valley could flood up to a width of 40 kilometers, at times sweeping away whole villages, explains Jost Armbruster, an engineer and biologist in the Nature Conservation Unit at the Karlsruhe Regional Council.- These meandering floodwaters created a complex and rich mosaic of different habitats ranging from open rocky islands formed by gravel swept down from the Alps, to low lying swampy areas and the moist softwood forests at Rappenw?rt, which thrive in the rich silts and clays dumped during a flood. The Rhine has undergone extensive \"correction\" to accommodate boats With so many diverse conditions in one area, the floodplain forests have a rich biodiversity. Some 9,000 plant species, as well as a rich variety of animals, birds and insects, including 55 different types of dragonfly and 170 types of wild bee, are found here. Penned in and parched Because of the area\\'s ecological importance, in 2008 the Upper Rhine floodplain became one of only ten cross-border sites certified under the international Ramsar wetlands convention. But like others in Europe, the Upper Rhine\\'s floodplain forests are being parched of their vital floodwaters. Two hundred years ago this year, the ground was broken on-a colossal project, just five kilometers away from-Rappenw?rt.-The engineer Johann Gottfried Tulla was in charge of the Rhine-\"Correction\" program, which aimed to straighten the-Rhine and reduce flooding.- During the past two hundred years, the Rhine has been put into a kind of straightjacket - its bends have been straightened and groins have been added to increase the water flow for the barges transporting cargo along the river. Its banks have been reinforced and it\\'s been hemmed in by dikes. It\\'s estimated that the area of floodplain between Basel and Karlsruhe has plummeted from 1,000 square kilometers to 130 square kilometers - a loss of 87 percent. Sixty percent of its alluvial forests have already disappeared. On both the French and German side of the Rhine, there are efforts large and small to improve the conditions of the Upper Rhine. As part of a European Union-sponsored LIFE conservation project, for example, two Rhine branches that had become separated from the Rhine were recently reconnected. White willows need sediment left by flooding to germinate Reshaping and reviving \"The mud and silt that had deposited in them in the last decades could be washed out, making the tributary bottoms gravelly again,\" says Armbruster, the project manager. \"Certain types of migratory fish, such as the salmon and the allis shad, a type of herring, need these gravel bottoms to spawn.\" Three artificial islands were also built as part of the LIFE project. Their gravelly banks are vital feeding and nesting grounds for wading birds such as the ruddy and the little ringed plover, which only nest on open ground. Projects such as this one, which was supported by the EU as well as local and state authorities, show a changing awareness of the urgent need to save the remnants of the Rhine wetlands. But without regular and extensive flooding, both Armbruster and Wolf say there are limits to how much the area can be regenerated. In Rappenw?rt, skaters traverse a frozen tributary that\\'s still separated from the Rhine by an embankment. In a few months, the waters will fill with migratory birds returning from the south, and the white willow forest will be carpeted with wildflowers - further reminders of the precious life this river brings.'],\n",

The diva has announced she is pregnant with twins - and social media users reacted with a slew of hilarious memes and name suggestions. Beyonce and her husband rapper Jay Z announced Wednesday on Instagram that the pop star is pregnant with twins. \"We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two,\" wrote Beyonce on Instagram in a post signed \"The Carters,\" which is Jay Z\\'s real last name. The post included a photo of the star dressed in panties, a bra and a veil, revealing her baby bump. She is kneeling beside a gigantic floral arrangement with her hands on her visibly pregnant belly. Some fans were quick to point out that Beyonce\\'s announcement coincided with the start of Black History Month, which is observed through the month of February. The singer has been a vocal supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement against racism and police brutality, which became evident in the video to the first single of her \"Lemonade\" album, \"Formation.\" That album, released about nine months ago, also stirred debate-for hinting at Jay Z\\'s unfaithfulness, which was never confirmed. \"Lemonade\" is poised to win a Grammy on February 12. While Beyonce is known to be a personal friend of Barack Obama and his-family, and she actively supported Hillary Clinton\\'s presidential campaign, this week\\'s happy announcement is certainly politically untainted. After nearly two weeks of emotional social media posts for and against President Donald Trump\\'s initial actions, some users welcomed a hiatus from news of the latest presidential escapades. That didn\\'t stop others, however, from finding the political angle to the Carter family\\'s news.  - Instagram record for most likes Beyonce has over 92 million Instagram followers and her post racked up over seven million likes within hours, breaking Selena Gomez\\'s record for a photo of her sipping a soda that has over six million likes. The star did not share the news on Twitter, but that didn\\'t stop her fans from taking to the platform: their posts using the hashtag #beyoncetewins have been flowing ever since the announcement, not only to celebrate, but also to offer-their two cents: Name suggestions abounded - most of which played on the name of Beyonce and Jay Z\\'s five-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy. Meanwhile, others put themselves in the shoes of Blue Ivy herself. In April, Beyonce is scheduled to headline the renowned Coachella Festival, which runs for two weeks in southern California. Her belly will likely be unmissable at that time. The star has been open about experiencing a miscarriage before giving birth to her first child, Blue Ivy, in 2012.

       " ['Concussion symptoms far more likely for soccer players that regularly head the ball A new study from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine suggests simply heading a football may cause long-term neurological problems. It suggests that head contact is far more sensitive than previously thought. Soccer players who-regularly header a ball are three times more likely to develop the symptoms of concussions compared to those that don\\'t, according to a new study published in the American Academy of Neurology journal. The report, led by researchers at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, contradicts previous studies that suggested that injuries such as concussion resulted mainly from full-on head impacts with other players or collisions with the goal posts. A total of 222 amateur players were studied over the course of the six-month study, which divided the participants into four groups dependent on how often they headed the ball. The top group was defined by heading the ball over 125 times every two weeks, while the bottom group headed the ball just four times in the same period. The study, published in the February 1 edition of Neurology, found that the group with the most headers was three times more likely to have symptoms --dizziness, feeling dazed, stopping play for medical attention or even losing consciousness --than those who rarely used their heads while playing. \"These results show that heading the ball is indeed related to concussion symptoms, which is contrary to a recent study that suggested that collisions were responsible for most concussions,\"?concluded the study\\'s author Michael L. Lipton. \"Our study suggests that you don\\'t need an overt collision to warrant this type of concern.\"?Previous warnings Factors that may lead to long-term neurological issues in soccer have long been studied, with most reports to date suggesting that single or repeated concussions do lead to neurological problems later in life. Such problems are even more prevalent in American football, where a five-year legal battle between the National Football League and former players concluded in 2016, with the league agreeing to pay out $1 billion to cover the medical payments of players for the next 65 years; with league actuaries estimating that just under 30 percent may go on to develop Alzheimer\\'s, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or other neural conditions. Yet this study is one of the first to suggest that even minor contact, such as heading an inflated, leather ball, can have long-term effects on a player\\'s health. \"These [previous]-studies did not actually measure heading,\"-Dr. Lipton wrote in his report. \"And thus they were unable to separate the relative contributions of intentional and unintentional head impacts.\"'],\n",

After the huge success of the Women\\'s March, it is now the scientists\\' turn to voice anger and dissatisfaction with new policies. Life under the new US president isn\\'t easy for scientists and science reporters. Donald Trump is a denier of man-made climate change and has called global warming a Chinese-propagated-myth. He has ordered the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the departments of the Interior, Agriculture, and Health and Human Services not to send out any press releases or update their website content for the time being. And he banned the National Parks Service from tweeting. In short, Trump has made many, many enemies in the science community within his first days in office. But scientists, science writers and their supporters are not taking the attacks lying down. They have formed a political action committee (PAC) to get more scientists elected to public office. According to its mission statement, the group called \\'314 Action\\' was founded because the US needs \"new leaders who understand that climate change is real and are motivated to find a solution.\" Many of the agencies affected by what they perceive as a presidential gag order have also set up \"rogue\" Twitter accounts from which they keep disseminating information. Those supporting verified facts, research and freedom of speech will also descend on Washington D.C. in a \"March for Science,\" a planned gathering inspired by the hugely successful Women\\'s Marches that saw millions of people across the world take to the streets to protest Trump\\'s policies on January 21. The slogan on the march\\'s website is \"Science, not silence.\" On Wednesday, the organizers announced via Twitter that the march will take place on Earth Day, April 22, 2017. In their mission statement the organizers write: \"The March for Science champions publicly funded and publicly communicated science as a pillar of human freedom and prosperity.\" Scientific method \\'on trial\\' in the US \"Scientists have battled the political and ideological forces against concepts such as evolution and climate change for years,\" Elizabeth Hadly, professor of biology, geological and environmental sciences at Stanford University, told British newspaper The Guardian. Hadly is ready to march because she sees the scientific discourse under attack in the US. That view is shared by science writers as well. Journalists who cover science and share important research and newly discovered facts with the public are worried about what their work will look like under Trump. \"It\\'s a dangerous time for society when the scientific method is on trial,\" Aleszu Bajak, a freelance science journalist based in Boston, told DW via email. \"I fear the muzzling of government scientists and the obscuring - and wholesale deletion - of government data pertaining to climate, health, or any topic deemed too \\'political\\' by the administration.\" More and more people are getting involved and are making their voices heard. Trump\\'s ban on Muslims entering the US is also riling scientists. \"Science is an international enterprise, and everyone is worried about what impact the travel ban will have on scientists from other countries,\" Apoorva Mandavilli, editor-in-chief of autism site Spectrum and a freelance science journalist, wrote to DW. \"Scientists who have never been politically active are getting engaged, tweeting about politics, and planning to march.\" Whether Trump\\'s policies will have a direct effect on how publicly scientists dare to talk about their research remains to be seen. \"I haven\\'t noticed a chilling effect yet on how researchers discuss their work; just fears that it might happen,\" Umair Ifan, staff writer at environment news outlet E&E News, wrote to DW. \"It\\'s too soon to tell.\" The upcoming March for Science at least is a sign that large numbers of scientists are not afraid to show their dissatisfaction or even anger with the Trump administration.'],\n",
       " ['Trump threatens environmental democracy Just a week into his presidency, Donald Trump is already undermining inclusive decision-making on environmental issues. Experts in the USA and abroad are concerned. Before he was inaugurated, fears swirled-that-President Donald Trump would make good on his environmentally unfriendly campaign rhetoric. After just a-week-in office, those fears may already be being-realized. Experts from the Washington-based global research organization the World Resources Institute (WRI) have-warned that environmental democracy could be under threat. According to the WRI, one of the first troubling signs on the horizon for environmental democracy --or inclusive decision-making on environmental issues---is the Trump administrations media blackout on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Just days into Trump\\'s presidency, emails were sent to EPA staff barring them from speaking to reporters, posting updates on social media or sending press releases. All incoming media requests would be screened by the administration from now on, according to the emails. Other agencies, including the US Department of Agriculture and the National Parks Service, were issued similar gagging orders. Clouding scientific transparency Political appointees are also exerting more oversight over the EPA\\'s scientific communications. Scientists at the agency were told-their scientific findings must be-reviewed on a \"case by case basis\"---at least for now --before they can be released to the public. This-includes-routine pollution-monitoring data. The WRI blog-says preventing citizens from having access to accurate, timely information that has not been editorialized or modified will \"obstruct an integral component of democratic policymaking.\" \"Citizens can neither understand nor participate in environmental decision-making without having access to objective, scientific information and data,\" the WRI-says, adding: \"As a public institution, the EPA is legally required to provide access to critical environmental information, such as air and water pollution monitoring reports.\"  US climate scientists held a rally against attacks by the Trump administration The blog-notes-this would be the first time the agency\\'s scientific data --including figures on-climate change --required-review by officials-before publication.- Legally, Trump cannot abolish the EPA, something-he pledged to do-during his election campaign. But he could still do much to wreck it over the next four years by slashing its staff and budget. Elizabeth Moses, environmental democracy specialist at the WRI and one of the blog post\\'s authors, told DW, \"People need to have objective access about environmental issues and the EPA plays an incredibly essential role in helping to educate people, businesses and a variety of other shareholders in terms of what those environmental facts are, so they can participate in decision-making. \"Anything that prevents people from getting that objective information is going to jeopardize-their ability to make well-informed decisions.\" Bypassing the public The president\\'s executive order to revive the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines,-without consulting-with the State Department and bypassing further public consultations, also looms as a major threat. \"Public participation is the bedrock of environmental democracy; yet the new administration\\'s plans may undercut this pillar of good governance,\"-wrote the WRI.  President Donald Trump signs an executive order to advance the Keystone XL pipeline Miranda Schreurs, professor of Environment and Climate Policy at the Technical University of Munich, told DW the growing encroachment on environmental democracy was \"shocking\"-and criticized the administration\\'s apparent bid to censor climate science. \"Regardless of which administration has been in power in the past, be it democrat or republican, the US has been a leader on environment science, and any action to damage this would risk climate science and the reputation of the USA as a leader on these questions,\"-Schreurs told DW. \"The real threat is that science is being discredited for what it is. It suggests that science needs to be vetted by political appointees and as soon as you do that, it appears politically motivated and that threatens a fundamental pillar of our society: the concept of objective science.\" She added: \"It does strike at the heart of democracy, because one of the key pillars of any democracy is to have access to information for its citizens.\" Given the EPA\\'s legal requirement to provide environmental information, Schreurs said any attempts by the Trump administration to stymie this could lead to legal action. \"The federal budget is being used to collate this information and it\\'s a transparency requirement that you know what\\'s happening with the information.-So yes, there could easily be grounds for lawsuits.\"'],\n",
       " ['Sweet silence: An industry shtum on artificial sugars unless they\\'r called Stevia There\\'s sugar in almost everything we eat. We need sugar for energy. But too much is bad for our health. So are artificial sweeteners the answer? Well, they can come with risks too - and a bad aftertaste. Going in search of people who will speak on the record about artificial sweeteners like Aspartame at a sweets fair is like going to a tobacco convention to talk about cancer. Everyone can see the elephant in the room but no one wants to chew it. And there\\'s a palpable sense of anxiety. No one wants to say the wrong thing.- I spent a day at Cologne\\'s international sweets fair (ISM 2017) on Tuesday, and I can confirm that watching the sweets industry side-step questions about artificial sweeteners is as cringe-worthy as witnessing the birth of a new dance. That\\'s true even for those companies that don\\'t use artificial sweeteners. Off the record they\\'ll happily tell about the nasty aftertaste of artificial sweeteners, that you have to mask it, adding chemicals upon chemicals. Or they\\'ll tell you about Aspartame\\'s former use as a deadly neurotoxin (a nerve agent in warfare). Oh and did you hear the one about the study that showed possible links between sweeteners and cancer? Yeah, well, that was back in the 1970s, and it was only found in lab rats, so how reliable is that anyway?- Other than that, the line is: We don\\'t talk about stuff we don\\'t do. We\\'re all natural.- And I did indeed come across two companies who profess to add no extra sugar. One was Natural Foods, who rely on sugars already in fruits like dates.-  Natural Foods with \"no added nonsense.\" That\\'s no extra natural sugar or artificial sweeteners to you and me \"It\\'s okay to get a bit of sugar on a daily basis, but there is so much added sugar, so we don\\'t add anything else,\" said Joost Warbout of Natural Foods. \"There\\'s a little bit [of sugar] from the fruit but that\\'s it.\" It\\'s a simple concept. If you pick up one of their fruit bars, the ingredients will read 51 percent cashews and 49 percent dates. Equals 100 percent. So it is possible. \"It\\'s cold pressed and because of the fruit it sticks together and because of the nuts it has bite, so we don\\'t have to bake it,\" said Warbout. Then there\\'s Germany\\'s old, establishment baker, Brandt. They also have a sugar-free product, but some sugar arises naturally through the baking process. Sometimes, just sometimes, \"sugar free\" actually means sugar free (although some sugar may arise through baking) The thing is, sugar-free for Brandt means \"not sweet.\" Shtum unless it\\'s Stevia- - But we do still like to eat sweet things. And why not? Live a little. Some will even say our desire for sweet tastes is genetic. Zucceroo makes decorative sugar products for things like cakes. They only use real sugar. \"The original sugar from sugar beet, or cane sugar, is what we all know and love. I\\'d say that is genetic,\" said Zucceroo\\'s Peter Forsch. \"Technical sugars like Stevia and Isomalt may have a place in drinks, but we don\\'t love them in food.\" - Zucceroo\\'s Peter Forsch says our desire for sweet things like sugar - real sugar - is \"genetic\" Stevia is the only artificial sweetener manufacturers seem comfortable talking about. Perhaps that\\'s because it\\'s plant-based, and it\\'s kind of a trendy super-additive at the moment. It\\'s a low-calorie sweetener and grows like herbs. Just ask the Swiss cough sweet-maker, Ricola.- \"We use Stevia because it\\'s a natural alternative that fits well together with bee balm. Stevia tends to have a taste on its own, so it doesn\\'t go with every product,\" said Ricola\\'s Luka Eiselin. \"But we use Stevia to be as natural as possible.\" The Coca-Cola company has apparently found Stevia\\'s natural taste an issue. The soda giant had to remodel its \"Coke Zero\" recipe a few times. I chewed on a Stevia leave at the ISM and it tastes a bit herby, minty and sweet. - \"We use alternative sugars because of the calories in natural sugar and the risk of diabetes, but also because sugar is bad for your teeth,\" said Eiselin.- Sour side-effects But artificial sweeteners have their own bad side-effects. \"Stevia is not much different from an artificial sweetener in my opinion,\" said Ulf Herrmann of Frusano. \"It has a bitter aftertaste and I simply don\\'t like it.\"- Frusano makes sweets suitable for people with a fructose intolerance, a dangerous condition. They use glucose syrup. Frusano\\'s Ulf Herrmann: Sugar alternatives are not always about lower calories, but countering a fructose intolerance \"Most producers who use artificial sweeteners use a mixture. Even if you use Stevia, usually there are also sugar alcohols like Sorbitol to mask the taste and make the sweetness round,\" Herrmann said. \"It\\'s almost the opposite of clean labeling. You add more and more ingredients to mask the side-effects of the one, and then another to mask that.\"?Labeling is clearly an issue with sweeteners and more so, the extent to which we, the consumers, understand or even read it. For instance, did you know that some artificial sweeteners have a laxative effect? They can cause bloating and intestinal gas. \"There\\'s a new EU law that says you have to write that on packaging,\" said Herrmann. \"The wording is something like \\'If consumed in large quantities, may cause diarrhea.\\' But it always does [if you consume a lot]!\" First the sugars, then the gelatin! Katjes has kickstarted a new trend: vegetarian sweets avoid animal-based gelling agents - -One of my next stops at the ISM was Dallmann\\'s, a German company best known for its sage cough sweets. I asked what they used in their \"sugar-free\" product: real sugar or sweeteners? Ricola, I said, uses Stevia now. The dapper Dallmann\\'s salesman, Herr Lippmann, in his fake apothecary lab coat, looked confused. Then he told me Dallmann\\'s uses a mixture of Sucralose and Isomalt. But he seemed distracted, and mainly concerned with pointing me back to his competitor Ricola, whose website showed \"they also use Aspartame.\" - The fact is Aspartame and other artificial sweeteners like Acesulfame potassium, Sucralose, and sugar alcohols like Isomalt are approved for use in foods in the European Union and the United States, just to mention two major markets. But the complete list of substances approved for use in food varies from region to region. Aspartame, like many other types of artificial sweeteners, is hundreds of times more potent than natural sugar. So you should always check the label on \"sugar-free\" products and if you\\'re unsure what the E-numbers - like \"E 954\" (Saccharin) or \"E 951\" (Aspartame) - denote, dig deeper online. Also check recommendations for \"Acceptable Daily Intake\"-(ADI).- On my way out of the ISM I headed back to the Ricola stand to ask them about Aspartame. Eiselin had left, so I had the pleasure of meeting the company\\'s young head Felix Richterich. Only as soon as I mentioned Aspartame, he no longer wanted to talk and insisted I contact Eiselin. I have yet to hear back. Please note: This article was originally published on February 1, 2017. At the-time of publication, Ricola had yet to reply to our request for comment on its use of Aspartame. Since then we have received an email from Lukas Eiselin. Here is an unedited, relevant part of his response: \"When Ricola launched the first sugar free herb drops in the 80ies [sic] aspartame was the state-of-the-art sweetener for tooth-friendly and low-calorie sweets. Although certain studies do raise questions to its safety, independent organizations such as the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) as well as the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) have tested the safety of aspartame and confirm that it is safe for consumption.\" -- These additional paragraphs were added to this article on February 3, 2017.'],\n",
       " ['Why we still need Shakira\\'s cultural m¨¦lange Colombian pop star Shakira, turning 40, is inspired by her Middle Eastern roots and has smashed sales records in Spanish and English. In times of insular politics, her globalized sound could be a healthy escape. She might just be the proof-some women may need that turning 40 is nothing to dread. Since dropping her lastest single, \"Chantaje\" featuring Maluma, last November, the Colombian superstar has been challenging her fans to send in videos of their own dance moves as they shake their own hips to her track. (Shakira faithfully posts most tweets twice, in Spanish and English.) A quick scan of #ChantajeChallengeContest offers a few moments of what the Germans would call \"fremdsch?men\" (being embarrassed for someone else) - and proof that at 40 Shakira herself still has the world\\'s fastest, sexiest hips. While with her midriff tops, skimpy dresses and erotic moves and lyrics, she may not embody the emancipated modern woman - and certainly didn\\'t in 2001 when she stormed onto the US music scene with her steamy \"Laundry Service\" video and run-of-the-mill pop album of the same name. Not your typical pop queen She was already a big star in Latin America, but with her North American breakthrough at the beginning of the 2000s, \"some people associated the Colombian singer with her American pop-music contemporaries Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera,\" wrote music magazine \"Rolling Stone.\" \"But the stylistic breadth of Shakira\\'s music - elements of folk, Middle Eastern and traditional Latin styles over a foundation of rock and pop - gave her a degree of credibility the American teen queens lacked.\" And perhaps that - besides her sheer vocal and dance talent - is what makes Shakira not only the inevitable superstar, but also all the more relevant in times of insular politics. So maybe we can\\'t dance like Shak (see #ChantajeChallengeContest). And maybe we can\\'t sing like Shak, a wunderkind who wrote her first song at age eight. But still, she could be any of us. Citizens of the world Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll was born in Barranquilla, Colombia, on February 2, 1977, as the youngest of eight siblings. Her Colombian-born mother had Spanish and Italian roots, while her father was born in New York to Lebanese immigrants. To create her signature dance style, the superstar is able to draw on her diverse cultural heritage - having tapped into her Lebanese background in particular to master the art of belly-dancing. The salsa beats in her 2006 megahit \"Hips Don\\'t Lie\" transported us to the palm-tree-lined squares of Havana, while \"Waka Waka\" made us all feel like Africans. Her 2010 single became the theme song of the FIFA World Cup in South Africa and the video has since racked up well over one billion views. As a UNICEF ambassador and founder of the Barefoot charity for kids in Colombia, Shakira\\'s activism has focused more on education than politics. But in times where national boundaries are being fiercely defended and cultural differences become points of contention, perhaps we are desperately in need of a beat that can break down barriers. Shakira\\'s Latin beats, spiced with Middle Eastern and other world elements and made comfortably familiar by being churned through the pop machine, make you feel like a citizen of the world - albeit one who traipses through the clubs of Miami, Barcelona, Cape Town or Havana, dressed in linen with cocktail in hand. -'],\n",

The monitoring device can be used even if an individual hasn\\'t been convicted. Authorities will be able to force suspected Islamist extremists believed to pose a threat to the public to wear-electronic ankle bracelets, the German cabinet agreed on Wednesday. Previously, only convicted individuals could be required to wear the-device used to monitor-location and movements. With the cabinet proposal, \"Gef?hrder,\" or people who pose a security threat,-who have not been convicted can be forced to wear the device by order of the-Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA). The change to the law was approved by the cabinet as part of a package of amendments to BKA law. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere and Justice Minister Heiko Maas had previously agreed to change the law in the wake of the December 19 terror attack on a Berlin Christmas market, which killed 12 people and wounded nearly 50 others. The attacker, Anis Amri, was considered a potential threat to public safety and under surveillance until a few months before the attack-when he fell off the radar.- He was ordered to be deported to his native Tunisia, but the deportation was postponed because Tunisia delayed providing his papers. Despite the deportation order, he was able to move around Germany.- The incident prompted sharp criticism of measures aimed at preventing terrorism.-In response, the-German government has put forward-a host of measures to overcome apparent security gaps.

       " ['Iraq\\'s wetland paradise under threat Climate change, dams and poor water policy could finish off the Mesopotamian Marshes Saddam Hussein once sought to destroy. With them, rich ecosystems and the unique Marsh Arab culture would be lost. Ali, 13, looks at the buffalo lying next to him in the straw. He affectionately calls it \"the baby.\" The animal is only two days old and-its birth was a relief for Ali\\'s family.-Here, in Iraq\\'s Mesopotamian Marshes, buffaloes are often the only capital and wealth. A year ago, Ali\\'s family lost half its buffaloes to-a severe drought. Most inhabitants of the marshes were similarly affected.- The-wetlands,-which some describe as the cradle of civilization, are located in southern Iraq, where the Tigris and Euphrates rivers meet and divide into dozens of channels before flowing-into the Persian Gulf. They are an oasis in the middle of the desert - a biodiverse-Garden of Eden - and home to the \"Marsh Arabs,\" whose unique culture is perfectedly adapted to their environment. Or at least, they used to be, before Saddam Hussein drained them in early 1990s to punish tribesmen there who backed a Shiite uprising against the Baath regime. That paradise, which once encompassed over 20,000 square kilometers, became a hell: a desert filled with mines. The rich wildlife disappeared and locals were forced to leave. Reviving Eden In total, half a million people were displaced as a result of what the United Nations in 2001 called a \"major ecological disaster, broadly comparable in extent and rapidity to the drying of the Aral Sea.\" In 2003, when Saddam Hussein\\'s regime fell following the US-led invasion of Iraq, the Marsh Arabs-returned home-and destroyed the dikes that blocked the rivers. \"There was no plan to restore the marshes,\" recalls local engineer Jasim al-Asadi, who was among the first to hack into the embankments built by Saddam Hussein. \"The locals took the initiative because this marsh is their life.\" Soon, water flowed back into the marshes. This could have marked a rare-happy ending for post-invasion-Iraq. But today, the marshes are again at risk and some fear they-could disappear-for good. The marshes are only half their former size and pick-ups now drive where once there was water Too salty for life \"There is a big problem with the water, both in terms of quantity and quality,\" explains al-Asadi, who is also the local managing director of Nature Iraq, a nongovernmental organization working on the marshes. Climate change,-poor usage and distribution of water in Iraq,-and above all dams upriver, have dramatically reduced the volume of water flowing into the wetlands. The marshes are about half the size-they used to be. And the water is too salty. With reduced water flow, rising temperatures and evaporation, as well as-saltwater intrusion from the Gulf, salinity levels have rocketed. \"Before Saddam drained the marshes, the salinity level wasn\\'t more than 200 ppm [parts per million],\" says al-Asadi, who remembers how the Marsh Arabs used to drink it. Average salinity is currently around 2,500 ppm. But it sometimes reaches 7,000 ppm - and in 2015 it reached 20,000 ppm in some parts of the marshes. \"The buffaloes would drink the water and die. They would poison themselves,\" remembers Sayeed Ali Murad, 29, a buffalo breeder living deep in the marshes. \"The reeds died, all the plants died.\" He lost more than 15 animals. Water as a weapon Iraq\\'s political and security situation has only made things worse since the-\"Islamic State\" (IS) organization took control of dams on the Euphrates in Ramadi and Fallujah. In June 2015, IS-closed the Ramadi dam gates, lowering the river\\'s-water levels. IS has lost control of Ramadi and Fallujah-but still holds Syria\\'s largest dam, the Tabqa dam on the Euphrates. All this makes survival in the wetlands harder. But so far,-Sayeed Ali stays. \"We are so happy here in nature.\" Just now, the situation is better, he explains. \"The water is okay at the moment,-but in a few months we will probably suffer from the lack of it.\" If the water decreases again, he admits he will probably have to leave. Sayeed Ali Murad says if things get any worse he will have to leave Indeed, a new threat is emerging, this time from Turkey. The Ilisu Dam, a contentious hydroelectric dam on the Tigris River, could start operation by the end of 2017, and would further reduce the water flow. \"Turkey, Syria and Iraq have agreements for sharing water resources - but Turkey doesn\\'t respect them,\" says al-Asadi. Ankara\\'s control of the headwaters of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers has long been criticized in the Middle East, with some blaming Turkish-water policy on shortages that have fed conflict and instability-in Syria and Iraq. Who cares about a marsh? In today\\'s chaotic Iraq --with its internal political crisis and rampant corruption - saving the natural wonder of the-Mesopotamian Marshes just isn\\'t high on the national agenda.- The country allocates most of its water to wasteful intensive irrigation practices, prioritizing agriculture over conservation. In July 2016, the Mesopotamian Marshes were added to Unesco\\'s World Heritage list as a \"refuge of biodiversity.\" Many Marsh Arabs doubt the impact of this-gesture. But-activist Toon Bijnens thinks it is \"more than symbolic.\" A member of the Iraqi Civil Society Solidarity Initiative, Bijnens says the inclusion of the marshes in the list \"sets priorities straight\" and could push Iraqi authorities to take action to protect the marshes. \"Now that the marshes are world heritage, the Iraqi government will have to develop a comprehensive water distribution plan which takes into account not only agricultural production, but also sustainability of the marshes.\"'],\n",

In a statement issued on Tuesday, the two companies announced their tie-up, saying that Daimler planned to \"introduce self-driving vehicles on Uber\\'s global ridesharing network in the coming years.\" The statement, however, didn\\'t reveal any financial details of the cooperation. Daimler chief executive (CEO) Dieter Zetsche said that the \"inventor of the automobile\" would aim to become a leader in autonomous driving, which was \"one of the most fascinating aspects of reinventing mobility.\" San Francisco-based Uber has invested heavily in self-driving car technology in recent years and is currently piloting the use of autonomous vehicles in the US city of Pittsburgh. But it had no car-building experience, CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick admitted, which was why he was \"opening up the Uber platform\" to automakers like Daimler. \"Self-driving technology holds the promise of creating cities that are safer, cleaner and more accessible. But we can\\'t get to that future alone,\" he said. Uber is already working with Sweden-based Volvo Cars to develop self-driving cars for sale by 2021.

       " ['Climate skeptic advisor says Trump could pull out of Paris climate agreement in days Ahead of the confirmation hearing of climate skeptic Scott Pruitt, President Trump\\'s nominee to head the EPA, former aide Myron Ebell says it\\'s only a matter of time until the US leaves the climate agreement. The former head of President Donald Trump\\'s transition team at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has said it is only a matter of time before the president pulls America out of the Paris climate agreement, and that an executive order on the issue could come within days. Myron Ebell said President Trump was determined to undo policies implemented by Barack Obama to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \"I expect Donald Trump to be very assiduous in keeping his promises, despite all of the flack he is going to get from his opponents,\" he told the media at a briefing in London on Monday. He was speaking at an event organized by The Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), the main group advocating climate change skepticism in the United Kingdom. Speaking in London, Ebell also called the environmental movement \"the greatest threat to freedom and prosperity in the modern world.\" Ebell, a long-standing climate change denier, said the United States would \"clearly change its course on climate policy\" under the new administration. \\'Multiple ways\\' to pull out Ebell worked for Trump until his inauguration on January 20. He sees himself as an \"enemy of climate change alarmism,\" and does not accept that carbon dioxide is affecting the Earth\\'s climate. He told the gathering the president could pull the US out of the Paris Agreement at short notice: \"He could do it by executive order tomorrow, or he could wait and do it as part of a larger package. There are multiple ways and I have no idea of the timing,\" Ebell said. Wednesday (01.02.2017) sees the confirmation hearing of President Trump\\'s nominee to head the EPA, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt. Critics are concerned because Pruitt also denies climate change, and has engaged in major lawsuits against anti-pollution regulations governed by the EPA. This includes the Clean Power Plan, which was the key element of the Obama administration\\'s emissions reduction program. The clean power plan aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants Fossil fuel chief as climate negotiator? Rex Tillerson, a former ExxonMobil chief executive, nominated by Trump as Secretary of State, indicated during his recent Senate hearing that the US might remain in global climate negotiations, which are being coordinated by the United Nations. In response to a question about the Paris Agreement, he said: \"I think it\\'s 190 countries have signed on. We\\'re better served by being at that table than by leaving that table.\" Yet apart from indicating it might be better to stay in the negotiations, Tillerson played down climate change considerably. Christina Deconcini, Director of Government Affairs at the World Resources Institute, told DW: \"He misstated and understated the scientific evidence around climate change and what is happening.\" ExxonMobil is accused of having covered up evidence of climate change in its own research for decades. As climate deniers are poised to serve in prominent positions of Trump\\'s administration, environmentalists have taken to the streets amid worries they could roll back environmental protections. Trump himself, who initially called climate change a \"hoax,\" eventually conceded \"some connectivity\" between humans and climate change, and has now said he is keeping an \"open mind\" on the issue. Pruitt is poised to become the head of the Environmental Protection Agency - an agency he repeatedly sued since becoming Oklahoma Attorney General in 2011. He opposes the Clean Power Plan, aimed at reducing carbon emissions. He has also blocked implementation of the Clean Water Rule, which expanded protection for bodies of water and requires polluters to clean up wastewater. Secretary of State nominee Tillerson worked for petroleum giant ExxonMobil for more than 40 years. During his confirmation hearing, when pressed, he acknowledged climate change risks. He said the increase in greenhouse gases is \"having an effect,\" but added \"our ability to predict that effect is very limited.\" ExxonMobil is accused of covering up climate research over several decades. Environmentalists are concerned that as Secretary of Energy, the former Texas governor will boost oil and gas rather than focusing on renewables. In the past, Perry said he intended to axe the whole energy department. He has called global warming a \"contrived phony mess.\" He\\'s likely to support the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline. However, Texas did increase wind power production under Perry. Zinke, an ex-Navy SEAL commander from Montana, keeps changing his position on climate change. Initially in favor of climate protection, he later denied it even exists. At his confirmation hearing he told Senate, \"I don\\'t believe it\\'s a hoax.\" As head of the Interior Department, he would oversee about a fifth of all US land - and make decisions about coal mining, and drilling for oil and gas. Author: Sarah Steffen From rhetoric to action Ebell told the press in London he assumed the president would overrule Tillerson on any dispute over climate policy. However, President Trump\\'s recent assertion that he would give his secretary of defense, James Mattis, the final say in a dispute over policy on torture could indicate that he may allow his cabinet to make decisions that are not necessarily in line with his own rhetoric. President Trump has already removed the climate change page from the White House website, revived two controversial oil pipelines and put communications restrictions on the EPA and the National Parks Service. Although he appears to have moved slightly away from his campaign stance by admitting there is \"some connectivity\" between human activity and climate change, he has also stated that he will not allow environmental or climate regulations to make US companies uncompetitive. \"There are reasons to think some of the rhetoric might be toned down and different decisions made along the road,\" WRI\\'s Deconcini told DW. She says Trump may realize that it is \"in America\\'s best interests\" to remain in the Paris Agreement after all. Climate goals still in sight Even if the new administration does roll back the Clean Power Plan, Deconcini saysother developments could mean the US could still achieve its climate targets of reducing 2005 emission levels 26 to 28 percent by 2025. \"It\\'s quite conceivable that under a new administration, the states would really up their game,\" Deconcini said. She also pointed out the tremendous speed with which renewable energy is advancing, and how fast the price of it is coming down. Renewable energy has taken on its own momentum, and is now among the cheapest forms of energy to develop \"So it\\'s possible through market forces, and good state actions and businesses - who are not going to stop moving in low-carbon directions - that we will be able to meet those targets.\" Deconcini said she hoped the President\\'s background as a businessman would convince him that if the US is to be competitive, it must not \"cede the ground on the clean energy race to other countries.\" Convinced of-climate impacts She told DW opinion polls showed people in the US are extremely interested in moving to a low-carbon economy: \"Many polls demonstrate it\\'s not the top concern of people in the US; but people generally want policymakers to move in that direction.\" The WRI believes as climate impacts become increasingly evident and costly, the pressure to combat climate change will increase. Deconcini cites concern over the likely impact of sea level rise in Florida as one example. \"I think that will increase the urgency over time, and the amount that elected representatives hear from their constituents about wanting to move towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\" Myron Ebell, however, remains convinced that President Trump \"thinks global warming is not a crisis and does not require drastic and immediate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.\" At one point considered to be a pick for heading the EPA, Ebell has now returned to his position as Director of Global Warming and International Environmental Policy at the Enterprise Institute, an advocacy group based in Washington, D.C.'],\n",
       " ['What is carbon monoxide poisoning? Breathing in too much carbon monoxide is one of the leading causes of death from poisoning in most countries. But how exactly does it lead to death? Two tragic cases in Europe have raised awareness of the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning. Over the weekend, six teenagers died in the southern-German town of Arnstein after they had spent the night in a garden shed with a defective wood-fired heater. And last week,-three migrants had died in a refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos-because they were using makeshift stoves in tents, according to news agency AFP.- Carbon monoxide poisoning is associated with a dangerous collection of symptoms - lightheadedness, confusion, headaches and dizziness can all occur from mild acute poisoning, Greater exposure can result in-toxic levels in the heart and central nervous system, which ultimately leads to death. Although the gas is extremely toxic it is completely odorless, tasteless, colorless and non-irritating, making it extremely difficult to detect,-or for someone to notice that they\\'re breathing it in.- After someone breaths in carbon monoxide it enters the bloodstream, where it then bonds with the haemoglobin in the blood stream to form carboxyhaemoglobin. As carbon monoxide molecules-has a stronger affinity to-haemoglobin than oxygen, the oxygen get \"crowded out.\" There\\'s essentially no space left for it on board-the red blood cells.-It means the-oxygen can\\'t be carried in the blood,-which ultimately leads to the death and failure of other cells and tissues-in the body. Carbon monoxide is primarily released in to the air when fuels such as gas, oil and coal don\\'t burn completely. Poorly installed or badly-maintained boilers, gas fires, water heaters or cookers are common sources of accidental leaks of the dangerous gas. How do you cure a poisoned patient? The initial treatment for carbon monoxide poisoning is oxygen therapy in a hospital. This involves asking the patient to breath in 100 percent oxygen to allow-the-body to gradually replace the carboxyhaemoglobin. Since normal air contains around 21 percent oxygen, it means the body can flush out the toxic chemicals. Therapy usually continues until the levels of carboxyhaemoglobin in the bloodstream is less than 10 percent.- In some cases hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is used. This process floods the body with oxygen in a pressurized room or tube and can be used if the patient has been under exposure to carbon monoxide for a long period of time or is suspected of having nerve damage.- Recovery- If a patient avoids critical damage from poisoning they can often recover, with the time dependent on how much of the gas was in the body.-However there are often long-term complications after treatment. These can involve breathlessness, chest pains, seizures and often loss of consciousness. As well as brain damage in the-form of vision loss, hearing loss or even the development of Parkinson\\'s disease. Over exposure can also effect the heart, with many survivors developing coronary heart disease, which can lead to heart attacks.- According to the British National Health Service-10-15 percent of survivors tend to develop some form of long-term effects of carbon monoxide poisoning.-'],\n",
       " ['Can a deposit system help reusable coffee cups catch on? Some 320,000 disposable cups are thrown away every hour in Germany. Reusable cups have long been touted as the solution. But will they ever catch on? With clever financial incentives, perhaps yes. The active service life of a disposable coffee-to-go cup is about 15 minutes. Once it\\'s over, it gets chucked into a dustbin, or onto the street or into some bushes. This daily phenomenon plagues cities everywhere. It entails significant on-going clean-up costs, and it\\'s an eyesore. Disposable plastic cups are an extra-big problem - their remains can-last indefinitely in the environment. According to data from Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH), a German environmental organisation, almost three billion cups land in the trash in this country-every year. On average, each of Germany\\'s 82 million people uses 37 cups a year, and the production of plastic cups or plastic-sheathed paper cups causes CO2 emissions of more than 100,000 tonnes per year in Germany. Trend toward reusable cups? Public discomfort about disposable cups is increasing. Consumers, caf¨¦ operators and cities are looking for solutions.- People often bring their personal cups along on the morning commute to work. More and more canteens, bakeries and caf¨¦s are now offering reusable cups as an alternative to disposables. Overflowing rubbish bins like this one, photographed in January 2015 in Berlin, are an all-too-common sight The city of Berlin is now preparing to attempt a great leap forward: soon, coffee consumers in Berlin will be able to enjoy their coffee-to-go from a refillable cup supplied by coffee retailers. You have to pay pay-a deposit, which will be quickly and easily refundable when the cups are returned to participating retailers. The Berlin administration\\'s proposal for the introduction of a multi-use returnable cup system is now being discussed by its Environment Committee. The initiative is scheduled to be voted on within the next few weeks by the city\\'s municipal parliament. \"We see a clear trend in the direction of reusable cups, starting with small initiatives in cafes, projects at German universities or with the Berlin S-Bahn. The decision by the city\\'s politicians paves the way for a multi-reuse future,\" said Stefanie Otterstein of DUH. About 3.8 million disposable paper or plastic cups are thrown away in Germany each day - more than a few of them become litter Cheaper for both consumers and retailers Every year around 2,400 tonnes of coffee-to-go cups are produced in Berlin. Berlin\\'s policy initiative aims to support a shift from disposable to reusable cups with incentives: a-discount of at least 20 cents on the retail price of a cup of coffee, for consumers who use reusable rather than disposable cups. If it succeeds, the measure will have a double benefit: it\\'ll be better for the environment, and it will save the government money on cleanup costs for parks and public places. It\\'s an echo of the deposit system on many glass and plastic bottles that has been in place in Germany for many years. Feel-good coffee-to-go A pilot project in Berlin called \\'Just swap it\\' has already generated encouraging early results. The initiative\\'s organizers developed a reusable mug made of bamboo, cornstarch, and synthetic resin, which is lent to customers in participating Berlin caf¨¦s for a 4 euro ($4.32) deposit. The customers can take the cup with them, and give it back at other cafes. Freiburg has its own reusable, refundable coffee cups (on the left) \"The mugs are catching on,\" project manager Ulrike Gottsauk told Deutsche Welle. \"Our goal is responsible consumption with a good feeling. We don\\'t want to point our fingers at consumers and induce a guilty conscience.\" According to Gottschau\\'s data, reusable cups and the deposit system also make financial sense for caf¨¦s: a-plastic cup including lid costs coffee sellers about seven cents, whereas the cost of washing reusable cups is less than half that amount. Incentive for environmentally friendly consumption Other German cities want to promote the use of reusable cups too. In Freiburg\\'s city center, the reusable \"FreiburgCup\"-has been available in caf¨¦s and bakeries since last November. Freiburg was-the first city in Germany with a multiple-reuse cup deposit system. \"We want people-to produce less waste and throw fewer coffee cups onto the streets,\" says Gerda Stuchlik, Freiburg\\'s mayor. The city\\'s quarter of a million residents currently go through about twelve million disposable cups annually.'],\n",
       " ['Why some wild hamsters become crazed cannibals An all-maize diet is turning wild hamsters in northeastern France\\'s maize fields into deranged cannibals that devour their own offspring. The same crazy-making nutritional deficiency has affected humans in the past. A balanced diet with all the right nutrients isn\\'t important only for humans. It\\'s important for wild animals, too. Its absence can lead to rather horrifying consequences - as the example of wild hamsters living in western European farmlands demonstrates. The numbers of wild European hamsters (Cricetus cricetus) have declined by more than 99 percent-over recent decades in Belgium, the Netherlands and the adjacent German federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia during recent decades. It was already known that ploughing of fields, which destroys their underground burrows, was part of the reason, and pesticide exposure probably another. But a group of researchers led by Mathilde Tissier, a biologist at the University of Strasbourg in northeastern France, wondered if a nutrional imbalance might be part of the reason for the steep-decline too. Life in the maize fields Tissier and her colleagues knew that there\\'s little other than maize available for wild hamsters to eat in the industrial maize-field monocultures that have replaced natural ecosystems over huge swathes of Europe, to produce raw materials for biofuels as well as fodder for pigs or humans. Maize - usually called corn-in the United States and Canada-- is a grain plant first domesticated by indigenous peoples in Mexico about 10,000 years ago. It is-descended from a genus of plants in the grass family called Zea-by scientists, or \"teosinte\"-in native Mesoamerican languages. Num, num. A balanced diet is important - not just for humans... The Strasbourg researchers knew that a nutritional deficiency caused by a diet too dominated by maize had caused health problems in human populations in the past. From 1735 to 1940, maize-based diets led to the death of hundreds of thousands of people from pellagra, a complex disease caused by deficiencies of either tryptophan or vitamin B3, or both. Vitamin B3 is also known as-niacin,-and if you look closely at the list of ingredients on a box of processed cereals, you\\'re likely to find niacin has been added. That\\'s a direct consequence of the pellagra problems of the past. Symptoms of niacin deficiency Pellagra is associated in the medical literature with the \"three Ds\": Diarrhea, dermatitis, and dementia. Physiological symptoms included red skin lesions, hair loss, enlargement and inflammation of the tongue, poor coordination, peripheral nerve damage, and an enlarged, weakened heart. But pellagra also makes people crazy. Prior to developing full-on dementia, pellagra sufferers display mental symptoms including heightened aggression, irritability, restlessness, intolerance to sensory stimuli like bright lights or odors, insomnia, emotional instability, and mental confusion. Was the same phenomenon - pellagra, and its raft of symptoms - affecting wild European hamsters whose diet was too maize-dominated? Tissier decided to find out --by feeding groups of hamsters different diets in the laboratory. A late 19th century victim of pellagra disease in North Carolina, USA A first set of lab experiments with wild specimens compared wheat-based to maize-based diets, each with side dishes of clover or worms. There was virtually no difference in the number of pups born, or the basic nutritional value of the different menus. But when it came to survival rates, the difference was dramatic. About four-fifths of the pups born of mothers feasting on wheat-and-clover or wheat-and-worms diets were successfully weaned. In stark contrast, only five percent of the baby hamsters whose mothers ate maize instead of wheat lived to the end of the weaning period. What was most disturbing is how some of them died: Their mothers - or, in some cases, their siblings - ate them. \"Females stored their pups with their hoards of maize before eating them,\" the scientists reported. \"Pups were still alive at that time.\" The maize-fed mothers showed other signs of abnormality: they ran in circles, \"climbing and pounding their feeders,\" when scientists entered the room. They also had swollen and dark tongues, reminiscent of \\'black-tongue syndrome\\' in dogs whose diets are deficient in niacin. The maize-fed hamsters had-blood so thick it was difficult to draw for samples, and a variety of skin or hair abnormalities. Maize - tasty for humans, bad news for hamsters Hamster pellagra After the first round of experiments, it seemed likely to Tissier that the hamsters were indeed experiencing their species\\' version of pellagra. \"Improperly cooked maize-based diets have been associated with higher rates of homicide, suicide and cannibalism in humans,\" the researchers noted in their final report, drawing a clear parallel between cannabalistic hamsters and-the types of craziness observed in 19th century-humans afflicted-with pellagra. So they re-ran the same set of dietary experiments with new groups of hamsters, with one difference: in the second round of experiments, they added a group of hamsters whose maize-based diets had been supplemented with added niacin (vitamin B3). Sure enough, the niacin-enriched diet was enough to eliminate the horrific symptoms associated with the maize-based diet. None of the niacin-supplemented mothers ate their young. The dire consequences of a vitamin B3-deficient maize diet, the scientists concluded, stemmed from a change in the hamsters\\' nervous system that induced-dementia-like behaviours. A normal hamster mother checking on her pups in their underground burrow A wider problem? If humans, dogs, and hamsters are all at risk of forms of pellagra if they\\'re restricted to excessively maize-based diets, the scientists suggested, other species of wild animals beyond European hamsters - for example, other wild rodents - may also be at risk of pellagra-like diseases and population declines in territories dominated by maize monocultures. \"Knowing that [wild animal] species [that live in modern farmlands] already face many threats, and that most of them are in danger of extinction, it is urgent to restore a diverse range of plants in agriculture schemes,\" the researchers wrote in conclusion. Gerard Baumgart, President of the Research Centre for Environmental Protection in Alsace, is an expert on the European hamster. Speaking to AFP on Friday, he agreed with the Strasbourg researchers\\' recommendations. \"Our hamster habitat is collapsing,\" he said. \"Monoculture in agriculture is really bad for biodiversity... Now we need to take concrete action.\" Conservation schemes available to support the remaining populations include restoration of diverse natural habitats, captive breeding, and reintroductions.

       " ['When boxer crabs fight, anemones are the real winners If you\\'re a pom-pom boxer crab, you\\'ll often need to fight to stay alive. When the bell rings, you\\'ll need your anemone to pack some extra sting. Don\\'t have one? Just steal a bit from a friend and feed it like a pet. The relationship between boxer crabs and the sea anemones that they use as pom-pom boxing gloves is one of the most unusual in nature. Scientists on the island of Fiji have discovered a type of ant that plants, fertilizes and guards its own coffee crops. The industrious creatures have been perfecting their agricultural know-how for millions of years. (22.11.2016) Sex is a serious business for arachnids, and male spiders are often eaten by the female after mating. So spiders have had to develop strategies to help pass on their genes. The males have found a work-around. (21.09.2016) Before the birds and the bees, there was Fractofusus, a prehistoric creature that scientists think was the first organism to use complex methods to reproduce, rather than just asexually multiplying. (05.08.2015) Israeli scientists found that it\\'s possibly unique, with-crabs - also known as Lybia or pom-pom crabs - controlling the-reproductive activity of the anemone. The group were following up on a previous study that showed the crabs - unflatteringly classed-as \"kleptoparasites\" - regulate the food intake and, hence, the-growth of their \"guests.\" Scientists go-so far as to-liken-this to the careful-cultivation of bonsai.- Sea anemones throw out a protective shield around their crustacean host, which can save it from being gobbled up by a predator.- They also help the crabs-to pack a punch, having tentacles on their claws that are covered in stinging cells. This-helps-ward off predators, and-can-come-in handy in a duel. Crabs - which hold onto anemone with hooks - can also use them-as food mops, gathering debris from around their-home. While the anemone admittedly gets to feed off the scraps, it seems they benefit least from the relationship. After all, who wants to be a mere mop or pom-pom? Every crab has its mits full Researchers from Israel\\'s Bar-Ilan University and Volcani Center looked at the relationship a little more closely. Each-crab they had seen in the wild had two anemones. The team wanted to know how the crabs might come by their tentacled fighting tools in the wild. The crabs are tiny and hard to observe in the wild, so the scientists took a look at how they behaved in the laboratory. They found that when one sea anemone is taken from a crab, it will weave two smaller fragments from the remaining one. Over the next few days this then grows and regenerates. When a crab with no anemone is placed with a crab boasting the usual-two, the creature-without one will launch a brave assault on its tank-mate. Handled with care They\\'ll do so by holding down the claw of their opponent, and removing all or part of the anemone. Most such encounters would end with a successful theft, and the crabs would-grows whatever they were left with. \"Sea anemone splitting appears to be a well-orchestrated behavior, conducted with apparent care for the final outcome, ie, two new viable sea anemones,\" said the authors of the study, published in the open access journal PeerJ.- According to the researchers, it\\'s a unique example of one animal inducing the asexual reproduction of another. Perhaps that explains a little more of what\\'s in it for the anemone. It\\'s also what seems to happen in the wild. Using German DNA amplification techniques, the team-looked at genetic fingerprints from beaches near Eilat, on the Red Sea. Each crab was found holding genetically identical anenomes, indicating that they were originally one. In a previous study, the scientists found that the crabs, which themselves only grow to abount 2 centimeters (less than an inch),-appear to limit the amount of food that aneome get, limiting their size. Good things, as far as they\\'re concerned, come in small packages.-- -'],\n",
       " ['Love tequila? Then raise your glass to bats The next time you decide to purchase a bottle of tequila reflect on this phenomenon: cocktails would be a lot less interesting without the contributions of tequila bats. Bats are cemented in the popular imagination as fanged creatures of the night intent on sucking our blood. Rarely are they lauded for their role in bringing tequila shots and margaritas to the bars of the world. Yet without them, this beloved booze from Mexico might not exist. These flying mammals and the agave plant - from which tequila is derived - have co-evolved over millions of years. The lesser long-nosed bat, or tequila bat for short, flies under the cover of night to feed on the flowering desert plant. In exchange for its nectar, the bats scatter the agave\\'s seeds and pollen, allowing the spiky succulent plant to propagate and thrive in the wild.- With a range spreading across the American Southwest and much of Mexico, the bats are the primary pollinator of agave plants. But industrial farming practices in the tequila fields of Mexico disrupted that relationship many years ago, putting the tequila sector and the bats at risk.- The \\'Bat Man\\' of Mexico Tequila bats and agave plants have a mutually beneficial relationship In Mexico, around 138 species of bat are known to exist in addition to 180 species of agave plant. \"Mexico has more species of agave than any other country in the world,\" says, Rodrigo Medellin, a professor of vertebrate biology at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. Medellin, whose conservation work and lifelong interest in bats has earned him the moniker \"bat man,\" is concerned about the resilience of both agave and its pollinators.- As the source of tequila, blue agave is one of Mexico\\'s most commercially valuable crops. But during the 1990s, the monocropping of a single species of the plant led to disaster. A fungus chewed through row upon row of agave fields, extensively damaging the crop. Research suggests overproduction and poor land management practices were to blame. Medellin contends that the decline was also hastened by the loss of genetic diversity, thereby making the fields vulnerable to epidemics. \"They lose genetic diversity each time they plant with clonal shoots,\" he said. Today, the vast bulk of the tequila produced in Mexico is the byproduct of cultivars. That means the plants are carbon copies of each other, selected by growers for their quick growth rate and higher sugar content, rather than for their hardiness. Once they reach their peak, the entire agave crop is harvested before the plants have a chance to flower and go to seed. But in doing so, large-scale producers have removed a major food source from the bats\\' diet, while undermining the future of the tequila industry by not allowing for genetic diversity, Medellin explained. \"You need to allow a few plants to bloom,\" he said.- Two visions, one goal To bring bats back into the equation, conservationist Medellin has joined forces with restaurant and bar owner David Suro, who founded the Tequila Interchange Project in 2010 to market and promote sustainable agave spirits.- While Medellin has been championing conservation efforts in Mexico and abroad, David Suro has been tackling the problem from a different angle. He formed TIP with the goal of overhauling the dubious reputation tequila has had in the eyes of American consumers.- A small group of tequila growers in Mexico has agreed to make some of their crop bat friendly As the owner of a Mexican restaurant in Philadelphia, he knew his customers regarded tequila as the devil\\'s brew because they told him as much. To combat this bias, he sought out anthropologists and historians to better understand the role agave plants have played in Mexico\\'s history and culture. A product of the arid landscape, ample sunshine and mestizo society, \"tequila is very emblematic of Mexico,\" Suro said. Through his work, Suro eventually encountered Medellin. After bonding over a shared interest in bats and agave propagation, they came up with a model for producing bat friendly tequila. The project involves a simple shift in agricultural practices that benefits plant biodiversity and bats.- \"By allowing 5 percent of the agave plants to flower, about 225 plants per hectare, growers extend an invitation to those responsible for maintaining the genetic diversity of agaves: the bats!,\" according to TIP\\'s website. A small group of tequila producers in Jalisco, a Mexican state along the Pacific, agreed to join the pilot phase of the project, allowing a small percentage of their agave crop to go to seed in order to attract tequila bats. \"We are crossing our fingers that the bats will bring what is desperately needed, which is genetic strength from wild agaves into the tequila fields,\" Suro said. As of December 2016, the organization has produced 265,000 bottles of bat friendly tequila intended for sale and distribution in the US with more to follow. According to Suro, the second stage will involve working with artisans in southern Mexico, whose skill for producing agave-based spirits dates back to the Spanish colonial era. Changing minds with tequila- Bat friendly tequila could get people talking about the benefits of bats, say conservationists Rob Mies, founder of the Organization for Bat Conservation, believes TIP is off to a good start. \"Tequila opens up a door,\" he told DW. In short, the intoxicating allure of artisanal tequila made by skilled craftspeople is a good conversation starter for the role bats play as insectivores and pollinators in rural economies. It also helps that tequila has an outsized reputation for loosening tongues and opening minds, among aficionados. As the coordinator for research projects that monitor the migration of bats across the United States, Canada and Mexico, Mies believes the initiative has a built in market. Tequila already has legions of fans in America and abroad. US residents have a powerful Texas-sized thirst for tequila, consuming approximately 120 million liters, per year. Bat friendly tequila \"is a great way to tap into what people already enjoy, do and understand, and that\\'s margaritas,\" he said.'],\n",
       " ['Antibiotics can boost bacterial growth We have long known that bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics. Now, British researchers have found that germs multiply much faster after becoming resistant, than they did before. Researchers at the University of Exeter exposed Escherichia coli (also known as E.coli) bacteria to eight rounds of antibiotic treatment over a period of four days. In the process, the germs, which usually cause stomach pain and diarrhea and in worse cases kidney failure, increased antibiotic resistance with each treatment. This was a mutation-the scientists expected. What they were not prepared for-was the observed speed with which the resistant germs multiplied after being treated. In one case the bacteria populations grew three times as big as in the case of normal E.coli bacteria within the same timeframe. Bacterial mutants are sustainable Even after removing the antibiotics, the mutated bacteria maintained its ability to multiply faster. \"Our research suggests, there could be added benefits for E.coli bacteria when they evolve resistance to clinical levels of antibiotics,\" lead author Prof. Robert Beardmore said. \"It is often said that Darwin evolution is slow, but nothing could be further from the truth, particularly when bacteria are exposed to antibiotics.\" He described the ability of bacteria to rearrange their DNA as \"remarkable.\" This could stop drugs from working sometimes in a matter of days. \"While rapid DNA change can be dangerous to a human cell, to a bacterium like E.coli it can have multiple benefits, provided they hit on the right changes.\"  In 2011 it became clear, how dangerous mutated forms of E.coli can be, when several people died of EHEC.  You may only know the Tasmanian devil as a cartoon character - the one that\\'s out to get the bird. But Australian scientists say the real thing may carry a deadly weapon against dangerous superbugs. (18.10.2016) With drug-resistant strains of bacteria jeopardizing the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and few new treatments on the horizon, scientists are looking to nature for answers. (29.11.2016) A strain of bacteria resistant to all known medications has been found in the US for the first time. Experts have long warned that overuse of antibiotics is creating drug-resistant bugs increasingly difficult to control. (27.05.2016) Asks Abdiel Reyes from Panama City (07.03.2016) Finding the source by DNA sequencing As part of the study, which was published on January 30th 2017 in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution, the scientists exposed the bacteria to the antibiotic doxicycline. Then, they froze the bacteria at minus 80 degrees Celsius and conducted gene sequencing to find out exactly which genetic changes were responsible for the observed resistance. Some of the changes were well known and described in clinical patients. One of them is the ability of the bacteria to produce more \"antibiotic pumps\". These are segments called \"pump DNA\", which literally pump antibiotics out of the bacterial cell with the result of ensuring-that the drugs can not do their work. But the scientists also discovered that the mutated bacteria were lacking part of the DNA-that is known to describe a dormant virus. Several parallel evolutionary processes at work What that means exactly is not clear, but Dr. Carlos Reding - a co-author of the study - has an idea. \"Our best guess is that losing viral DNA stops the E.coli destroying itself, so we see more bacterial cells growing once the increase in pump DNA allows them to resist the antibiotic in the first place,\" Reding said. \"This creates an evolutionary force for change on two regions of the E.coli genome\". Usually, bacteria tend to use self destruction as a means to colonize surfaces. That\\'s how a biofilm develops - the slimy substance found,-for instance,-in the drains of sinks. \"But our study used liquid conditions, a bit like a bloodstream, so the-E.coli could give up its biofilm lifestyle in favor of increasing cell production\", the researcher suggests. Using antibiotics in a targeted way Dr. Mark Hewlett - also from Exeter University - added: \"It is said by some that drug resistance evolution doesn\\'t take place at a high dosage but our paper shows that it can and that bacteria can change in ways that would not be beneficial for the treatment of certain types of infection.\" Anyhow, he concludes, that it is important to use \"the right antibiotic on patients as soon as possible. So we don\\'t see adaptations like these in the clinic.\"'],\n",
       " ['Earthworm numbers dwindle, threatening soil health Earthworms help recuperate soil and enrich it with much needed minerals. But environmentalists are concerned as earthworms have come under threat from intensive use of manure and acidic soil. Earthworms, it seems, are the unsung heroes of our world. Labeled slimy and disgusting by many, these lowly invertebrates work unseen and underground where they till, fertilize and improve soil. But environmentalists are concerned that industrial agricultural practices are making life difficult for this surprisingly important animal. Intensive use of manure and acidic soil with a pH value below five harm the worm, although it remains unclear whether herbicides affect earthworm\\'s ability to reproduce. Still, one thing is for sure: the destruction of its habitat every few months with heavy machinery stresses the animal. Fewer than 30 earthworms are found per square meter on intensively farmed fields. But on organic farms, where the fields are rarely ploughed, up to 450 worms live in the same area, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). - That\\'s bad news according to agronomists and gardeners. A thriving earthworm population is an indication of healthy soil. And the retreat of the species is so evident-the WWF has published an \"Earthworm Manifesto\" to publicize the faith of these dirt-dwellers. - \"If earthworms suffer, so too does our soil and thereby the basis for agriculture and food supply,\" said Birgit Wilhelm, a WWF expert in the farming sector. For Wilhelm, these worms-are the least appreciated creatures on the planet. Diligent workers Earthworms are industrious and irreplaceable in that they tirelessly work to fertilize and aerate soil, and in the process help prevent soil erosion. \"Strictly speaking, there are 45 species and four categories [of worm] that carry out a range of tasks,\" explained Professor Heinz-Christian Fr¨¹nd, an environmental scientist with expertise in soil at the University of Osnabr¨¹ck. - A healthy soil full of earthworms can absorb up to 150 liters of water per hour Some eat fallen leaves and wood on the soil\\'s surface. Others gather en masse in compost heaps. A third category lives in mineral soil, which is derived from minerals or rocks and contains little humus or organic matter. The worms replenish the soil with their excrement, which contains all the nutrients plants needs to thrive, including nitrogen, phosphorous, and calcium. \"The most well-known species of worm, the common earthworm, plays a major role for the farming sector,\" said Fr¨¹nd. The animal builds a system of tunnels in which it lives. It digs a vertical main entrance from the top layers of the soil until it gets to a damp, reliable depth. In an enormous show of strength, the worm burrows through the earth, aerating it, so oxygen and plant roots can reach further down. This act contributes to soil formation and regeneration and improves its ability to absorb water. The common earthworm feasts on rotting, bacteria-rich plant matter that it finds on the soil\\'s surface. \"Therefore, it\\'s essential that farmers don\\'t harvest right down to soil level, but instead leave some remnants,\" Fr¨¹nd said. - Effects of climate change Droughts are particularly devastating for worm populations. If there are too few worms, the soil will become dense, poorly aerated and won\\'t absorb enough water. \"Soil that contains many earthworms will absorb up to 150 liters of water per hour and square meter,\" said WWF\\'s Wilhelm. \"If the soil has too few worms, it will act like a blocked drain. Very little will get through. That can lead to floods.\" The tiny earthworms carry out important tasks for our soils - but the tiny creatures have come under threat Heavy metals, such as copper, are one of the factors that can reduce earthworm numbers. However, copper compounds are used mainly by organic farmers - particularly in vineyards. Wine producers have been using the substance as a fungicide for about 100 years, although the European Union has designated it a \"candidate for substitution,\" compelling member states to seek more favorable alternatives. \"Large amounts of copper can negatively impact an earthworm\\'s enzymes. It inhibits their growth or they can no longer reproduce properly,\" according to Bernd Hommel, an expert in analysis and organic chemistry at the Julius-K¨¹hn-Institute, a federal research center for cultivated plants. Although the researcher also established that some earthworm species can excrete the absorbed metal. Even the agricultural sector has long known that earthworms need to be protected, says Hommel. \"Only synthetic pesticides that have been tested in the lab and out in the field for compatibility with earthworms are coming to market,\" he added. - Future food Still, the WWF warns of a \"dangerous chain reaction for humanity,\" and has called for politics and society to encourage an agricultural sector more focused on soil and humus-friendly farming. The goal of the EU\\'s farming policy should be the promotion and maintenance of natural soil fertility, said WWF\\'s Wilhelm. At a time when development is swallowing up more and more countryside, good soil is becoming increasingly important to ensure a secure food supply for the world\\'s growing population. Long-term soil fertility and the ability of farmland to recuperate are under threat and protecting earthworms with their ability to improve soil should be an agricultural goal. Research has shown there are solutions. \"Using a soil cover with a catch crop such as grass during winter led to a sharp rise in earthworms,\" Fr¨¹nd said. It\\'s a glimmer of hope for these underground dwellers. -'],\n",
       " ['Meet the German movement to transform agriculture An estimated 18,000 people recently took to the streets in Berlin to show support for small-scale farmers and wholesome food. Why are food politics so big in Germany? Ottmar Ilchmann is a 54-year-old dairy farmer from Germany\\'s East Frisia region. He has just 60 cows, and says it\\'s becoming harder and harder for small farms like his to survive. \"I see how many of my neighbors have to close their farms, and how much other farmers are taking the land from these little farms.\" By other farmers, Ilchmann means the big industrial agriculture operations that are swallowing up more and more of the German countryside. \"They are growing and growing,\" Ilchmann told DW. His neighbors aren\\'t alone in shutting down their operations. According to the Alternative Farmers Association, nearly 4,000 dairy farmers went out of business last year. And organizers of a recent protest in Berlin against the industrialization of agriculture say almost 100,000 small producers have been forced to close in the last decade. Much of the problem, you\\'ll hear farmers and experts explain, lies with discount pricing. The drive for cheap food means many producers can no longer sustain themselves. Farmers Arlette Seiler-Fuller and Luna Piyczyk protest in Berlin. The young couple say theirs is the greatest job in the world Policy for protest The \"We are fed up!\" demonstration has been happening annually since 2011. On January 21, 2017, around 18,000 people marched through the streets of the German capital to show their support for small farmers and wholesome food, chanting \"A future on the land!\" \"People are looking for other possibilities to make good farming which is good for the environment good for the animals and good for the people,\" said Ilchmann, who drove his tractor all the way from northwest Germany to take part. He wasn\\'t alone. In all, 130 tractors made the journey, according to the one of the event\\'s organizers, Iris Kiefer. One traveled almost 600 kilometers (373 miles). Arriving at the demonstration, these producers joined concerned consumers, along with organizations from slow food advocates to international development nonprofits. Taken together, they are people who value the work of small farmers\\', and share their ideals. Fighting free trade Like Stephanie Roth, who campaigns against the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between Europe and Canada, which will be up for a vote in the European Parliament in February. \"We think it is really important to send personal messages to our elected deputies to tell them that we don\\'t want this free trade agreement,\" Roth told DW. Tractors pull away from Berlin\\'s Potsdamer Platz on as a part of the \"We are fed up!\" rally Roth argues that if Europe opens its market to foodstuffs produced more cheaply in North America, still more German farmers will be put out of business. The agreement would also allow genetically modified food into Europe. Recent studies indicate as many as 80 percent of Germans oppose this. \"There is a German saying that is very well known, every child knows it, it says: \\'Du bist was du isst\\' - you are what you eat.- And I think it is true,\" says Roth. Many in Europe see agreements that would harmonize conditions between Europe and North America as a threat. Karen Hansen-Kuhn works for the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy in the US. She says although small farmers are generally better off in Europe than they are in North America, things could shift. Public pressure \"What I hear from a lot of our EU partners is that we shouldn\\'t underestimate all of the pressure that is being put on EU policy makers to change,\" she told DW. This year\\'s demonstration put a special focus on helping young people to get into small-scale farming The risk is that if Europe were to step into line with countries like the United States, laws and subsidies could see small producers priced out of the market. But Hansen-Kuhn believes activists are making a difference. Food and farming have become an important public concern, and European lawmakers are having to listen to voters. \"You wouldn\\'t find the same thing in the US if you talked to a policymaker that they would be able to tick off, consistently, the same four sets of demands that they are hearing from local populations,\" she says. Part of that activism is about getting people out of the streets, as happened in Berlin last weekend. But Kiefer says the size of the crowd is less important than the dialogue between farmers, civil society and consumers. \"I think only if we go together, hand in hand, consumer and farmer, we can change our system-of food production.\"'],\n",
       " ['Opinion: Trump\\'s America is beginning to look a lot like China Media gag orders, suppressing public information, sweeping executive decisions - Donald Trump\\'s ecopocalyse has begun. It\\'s reminiscent of another world power\\'s approach to governing - with key differences. Trump\\'s war on the environment has begun - and information is its first target. After ordering a contract freeze and media blackout-at the Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday (24.01.2017), the administration on Wednesday went even further by mandating that any studies or data from the public agency undergo \"review\" by political appointees before being released to the public. The administration also reportedly instructed the EPA to remove the climate change page from its website, proving-citizen-driven efforts to collect and protect climate data-prophetic. The Department of Agriculture-also on Tuesday-issued an order banning scientists and other employees in its main research arm, the Agricultural Research Service, from publicly sharing results of its work. The Trump administration temporarily shut down the National Parks Service\\'s official Twitter account last Friday after it retweeted, among other things, a note that the new government-had removed references to climate change from the White House website. Specific offices of the National Parks Service, which is under the Department of Interior, were also targeted by the Trump administration after tweeting facts and information about climate change. While some tweets from the Badlands National Park account were deleted, rogue actions seem to be spreading to other park service accounts. Under a broad call to \"resist,\" National Parks Service employees have even set up an alternative Twitter account. Add to Trump\\'s acts of suppression sweeping executive orders, including to \"fast track\" development of controversial oil pipelines and build a border wall (which may never happen). Trump is also reportedly preparing an executive order to cut funding to the United Nations and review multilateral treaties including the Paris Agreement on climate change. Taken together, this paints a frighteningly undemocratic picture of unilateral control over public institutions. In fact, the picture it paints is reminiscent of another world power: China. From authoritarian to totalitarian Information is power - and the authoritarian-Chinese government is notorious for suppressing it. This applies to environmental matters as well. Recently, Chinese authorities told weather forecasters to stop issuing smog alerts. The Chinese government also ordered an app that collects air quality information to stop releasing data that exceeds official pollution caps. It\\'s trying to cover up how bad its air pollution problem really is. But China, at least, acknowledges the very real risks of climate change. The country is pledging to reduce emissions, and building out its renewable energy capacity. As climate deniers are poised to serve in prominent positions of Trump\\'s administration, environmentalists have taken to the streets amid worries they could roll back environmental protections. Trump himself, who initially called climate change a \"hoax,\" eventually conceded \"some connectivity\" between humans and climate change, and has now said he is keeping an \"open mind\" on the issue. Pruitt is poised to become the head of the Environmental Protection Agency - an agency he repeatedly sued since becoming Oklahoma Attorney General in 2011. He opposes the Clean Power Plan, aimed at reducing carbon emissions. He has also blocked implementation of the Clean Water Rule, which expanded protection for bodies of water and requires polluters to clean up wastewater. Secretary of State nominee Tillerson worked for petroleum giant ExxonMobil for more than 40 years. During his confirmation hearing, when pressed, he acknowledged climate change risks. He said the increase in greenhouse gases is \"having an effect,\" but added \"our ability to predict that effect is very limited.\" ExxonMobil is accused of covering up climate research over several decades. Environmentalists are concerned that as Secretary of Energy, the former Texas governor will boost oil and gas rather than focusing on renewables. In the past, Perry said he intended to axe the whole energy department. He has called global warming a \"contrived phony mess.\" He\\'s likely to support the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline. However, Texas did increase wind power production under Perry. Zinke, an ex-Navy SEAL commander from Montana, keeps changing his position on climate change. Initially in favor of climate protection, he later denied it even exists. At his confirmation hearing he told Senate, \"I don\\'t believe it\\'s a hoax.\" As head of the Interior Department, he would oversee about a fifth of all US land - and make decisions about coal mining, and drilling for oil and gas. Author: Sarah Steffen Therein lies an important difference: Trump\\'s America is all about handing out gifts to his fossil fuel cronies. On the same day he ordered the EPA media blackout, he sat down with beaming automobile executives to talk about how \"out of control\" environmental regulations are. Make no mistake: This is special-interest politics at its most extreme. United States environmental policy under Trump goes beyond China\\'s authoritarianism, since it doesn\\'t acknowledge - indeed, is trying to suppress - the basic fact that climate change exists. If China with its single-party system is authoritarian, Trump with his actions is totalitarian. Muzzling public agencies, strangling down their funding, removing their regulatory authority - will benefit only a few already wealthy businessmen. At the expense of the people. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Interior are taxpayer-funded institutions - therefore by the people, for the people. They exist to ensure clean air and clean water, and land use that manages wildlife and ecosystems in balance with human needs. Americans who support their right to clean air and clean water, and public lands managed in the public interest:-It\\'s time to stand up totalitarian policies. It is time to resist. Lest we allow special interests to complete their takeover of the US government. Sonya Diehn is Environment Team Leader at Deutsche Welle.'],\n",

Jovenel Moise has been sworn in as-Haiti\\'s new president, opening a new chapter in the country\\'s history after a long-running political crisis . The 48-year-old banana exporter, who has never held political office, took the oath of office on Tuesday in a ceremony in the capital, Port-au-Prince. The handpicked candidate of Haiti\\'s former president, Michel Martelly, Moise initially won the first round of voting in October 2015 - but the results were subsequently annulled amid allegations of massive fraud. The elections were further postponed in October after Hurricane Matthew battered the country, killing hundreds and causing extensive damage. Moise won a November election redo with 55 percent, vowing to stimulate the economy and create more jobs.- Yet, his critics claimed he did not gain a mandate because only 21 percent of voters went to the polls.- The new president begins his five years in power with an already fragile popularity, since he is at the centre of an unresolved money laundering probe.  Haiti\\'s Central Unit of Financial Intelligence alleges that Moise laundered $5m through suspicious money transfers - charges he denies. Haiti has been dependant on international aid since a powerful earthquake devastated it in January 2010.

       " ['Scotland rejects triggering Brexit in non-binding vote In a symbolic move, Scottish politicians vote by 90 to 34 against a bill that would trigger Britain\\'s exit from the EU. \\'Key test\\' Scotland\\'s devolved parliament has overwhelmingly rejected Britain\\'s march towards a European Union exit, in a non-binding vote-that could potentially be used as groundwork for a second referendum for Scottish independence. Tuesday\\'s symbolic motion, which was proposed by the Scottish government led by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, was backed by 90 votes to 34. It argued that the triggering of Article 50, which starts the two-year Brexit process, should be rejected because the UK government has left too many questions unanswered. OPINION: Scotland is trapped in a zombie union It said the Westminster parliament is not guaranteed a say in any new trade relationship once Britain has left the EU and the decision to proceed \"does not respect the majority vote to remain part of the EU that was returned in every council area in Scotland\". Scotland was told it would be an \"equal partner\" in the British union if it rejected independence, which it did by 55 percent in a 2014 referendum. In June 2016, Scotland voted to remain in the EU by 62 percent, but it was outvoted by England which has a vastly larger population. Brexit succeeded overall with 52 percent of the vote. Sturgeon has repeatedly demanded that the interests of Scottish people be taken into account during upcoming Brexit negotiations and says Scotland must have a choice on holding a new independence referendum if that is not the case. \"(This vote) is a key test of whether Scotland\\'s voice is being listened to and whether our wishes can be accommodated within the UK process,\" Sturgeon said ahead of the vote. OPINION: Nicola Sturgeon - The new champion of liberalism The Minister for UK Negotiations on Scotland\\'s Place in Europe, Mike Russell, said the Scottish government will never allow Scotland to be humiliated and its democratic choice rejected. \"We will never, ever, turn our back on Europe and the world,\" he said. Russell said there was still time for London to avert another independence bid by Scotland if it accepted a \"compromise\" - a differentiated solution that would keep Scotland in the European single market even as the rest of Britain leaves. Britain\\'s highest court ruled last month that the launch of Brexit talks must be approved by the British parliament, but Prime Minister Theresa May has no legal obligation to consult the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Amendments to May\\'s European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill currently making its way through the House of Commons, which would have given the regional governments a voice in the Brexit process, were rejected on Monday during a British parliamentary debate in London. Analysts say the Scottish parliament vote sends a clear signal to London that the Brexit process is proceeding without their support, but the UK government has no compulsion to listen. \"The UK government will continue our engagement with the Scottish government and with people and groups across Scotland as we prepare to leave the EU to secure the best deal for Scotland and the UK,\" a British government spokesman said.

       " ['Land grab law \\'allows theft, stalls peace process\\' Law that retroactively legalises settler homes on private Palestinian land widely condemned as legitimising theft. \\'Against all international laws\\' Israel\\'s land grab law that-retroactively legalises thousands of settlement homes in the occupied West Bank legitimises theft, violates international law and ends the prospect of a two-state solution, according to politicians, legal experts and human rights groups. The so-called \"Regulation Bill\"-instantly drew wide condemnation-as it was voted in by members of the Knesset late on Monday with a 60 to 52 majority. The law applies to about 4,000 settlement homes in the West Bank for which settlers could prove ignorance that they had built on privately owned Palestinian land and had received encouragement from the Israeli state to do so. Three Israeli NGOs - Peace Now, Yesh Din and the Association for Civil Rights in Israel - and numerous Palestinians said they intend to petition the Supreme Court to cancel the law.  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Tuesday in a statement: \"This bill is in contravention of international law and will have far reaching legal consequences for Israel.\" The EU\\'s foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said in a statement that the bloc-\"condemns\" the law and urges against its implementation-\"to avoid measures that further raise tensions and endanger the prospects for a peaceful solution to the conflict\". Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the law was an aggression against the Palestinian people. \"That bill is contrary to international law,\" Abbas said following a meeting with French President Francois Hollande in Paris. \"This is an aggression against our people that we will be opposing in international organisations. \"What we want is peace ... but what Israel does is to work toward one state based on apartheid.\" Hollande called on Israel to go back on the law, saying it would \"pave the way for an annexation, de-facto, of the occupied territories, which would be contrary to the two-state solution\". Hours before Abbas\\' meeting with Hollande, Saeb Erekat, secretary general of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, told the Associated Press news agency that the law puts \"the last nail in the coffin of the two-state solution\". Calling the move \"theft\", Erekat said the ruling showed \"the Israeli government trying to legalise looting Palestinian land\". AL JAZEERA\\'S SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST, MARWAN BISHARA: \"What you have here is a crazy number of settlers in the [Knesset]. Ten percent of the Israeli parliament are settlers; indeed the speaker of the Israeli parliament is a settler. The settler lobby within the Israeli parliament is quite strong, even when they know that what they are doing is unconstitutional and will probably not pass the Supreme Court. The idea is that the government gets in on it ... even if they don\\'t get their way this time, they will be compensated if the Supreme Court rejects it. All in all, there isn\\'t much room for international pressure on Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu knows it, he knows he has a president in the White House who\\'s going to back him.- Israel is basically going on a spree to increase the settlements in the West Bank. At the end of the day, this is a moving, explosive situation that I cannot see in any shape or form in the intermediate run is simply going to go by without real, major repercussions in Palestine or outside.- Developing, over the last 50 years, is a dual system of government: one for the Jews in the West Bank and one for the Palestinians. There is only one name for that: apartheid. The Arab League also accused Israel of \"stealing the land\" from Palestinians. \"The law in question is only a cover for stealing the land and appropriating the property of Palestinians,\" said the head of the Cairo-based organisation, Ahmed Aboul Gheit. Palestinian owners will be compensated financially or with other land, but cannot negotiate their terms. The law is a continuation of \"Israeli policies aimed at eliminating any possibility of a two-state solution and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state\", Aboul Gheit said. Jordan, one of the few Arab states to have diplomatic ties with Israel, also denounced what it called \"a provocative law likely to kill any hope of a two-state solution\". According to the UN envoy for the Middle East peace process, Nickolay Mladenov,-the law crosses a \"very thick red line\" towards annexation of the occupied West Bank, and sets a \"very dangerous precedent\". Speaking to the AFP news agency, he said: \"This is the first time the Israeli Knesset legislates in the occupied Palestinian lands and particularly on property issues.\" He also raised the possibility the law could open Israel up to potential prosecution at the International Criminal Court, a threat Israel\\'s own top government lawyer, attorney general-Avichai Mandelblit,-has also warned of. Mladenov called for strong international condemnation of the legislation but declined to criticise the US after President Donald Trump\\'s administration refused to comment on it. READ MORE: Israeli settlement law \\'violates rights and dignity\\' Trump is more sympathetic to Israel\\'s settlement policies than previous US presidents; the Israeli government has approved plans to build thousands of new homes on occupied territory since the far-right leader settled into the White House. \"I think that is a very preliminary statement,\" Mladenov said. \"Obviously they do need to consult, this is a new administration that has just come into office and they should be given the time and the space to find their policies.\" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the US was likely to discuss the law with Netanyahu when the Israeli prime minister visits on February 15, but did not comment further in a press briefing on Tuesday. David Harris, head of AJC, the global Jewish advocacy organisation, said that \"Israel\\'s High Court can and should reverse this misguided legislation\" ahead of Netanyahu\\'s meeting with Trump in February. That was also the message from Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who said last week: \"The chance that it will be struck down by the Supreme Court is 100 percent.\" International law considers all settlements to be illegal, but Israel distinguishes between those it sanctions and those it does not, dubbed outposts. A Palestinian Cabinet minister also called on the international community for support. \"Nobody can legalise the theft of the Palestinian lands. Building settlements is a crime, building settlements is against all international laws,\" said Palestinian Tourism and Antiquities Minister Rula Maayaa. \"I think it is time now for the international community to act concretely to stop the Israelis from these crimes.\" Nabil Abu Rdeneh, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, called the law \"unacceptable\" and urged the international community to act immediately. \"This is an escalation that would only lead to more instability and chaos,\" Rdeneh -said. Palestinians want the occupied West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip - territories Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East war - for their future state. READ MORE: Israel\\'s settlement bill \\'big step towards annexation\\' The international community views settlements as illegal and an obstacle to reaching peace. Shortly before leaving office, US President Barack Obama allowed the UN Security Council to pass a resolution declaring settlements illegal. Tobias Ellwood, Britain\\'s Middle East minister, also condemned the land grab bill, saying it \"is of great concern that the bill paves the way for significant growth in settlements deep in the West Bank\". Yuval Shany, an-international law professor at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, said the law violates basic rights, interferes with property rights and is discriminatory because it regulates only the transfer of land from Palestinians to Jews.

Islamabad, Pakistan --Pakistan\\'s government has extended a deadline for Afghan refugees to leave the country until the end of 2017, according to state media.  A meeting of the cabinet, presided over by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on Tuesday pushed back the refugees\\' legal right to stay from the previous deadline of March 31, state-run APP news agency-reported. There are currently about 1.3 million registered Afghan refugees resident in Pakistan, according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR). Many fled violence in their country more than 30 years ago, during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, with others fleeing the US-led invasion in 2001. There are also about a million unregistered Afghan refugees present in the country, Pakistani officials say. A recent crackdown by Pakistani authorities, citing security concerns, has seen a sharp rise in both deportations and voluntary repatriations of Afghan nationals from the country. READ MORE: A hard winter - Afghan refugees return from Pakistan Last year, more than 600,000 Afghan refugees left Pakistan to return to their home countries, data from the UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) shows. For registered refugees, that number represents a more than six-fold increase from the previous year, according to UNHCR. At least 22,559 Afghans were also deported by Pakistani authorities in that period, IOM says. Refugees and rights groups say increased harassment by police and stricter restrictions on crossing and returning from Pakistan\\'s northwestern border with Afghanistan have been responsible for the rising numbers.- The cabinet meeting on Tuesday reaffirmed those tighter controls on the border. \"It was also decided that the Afghans cross-border movement would now be regulated through the visa regime and their entry passes would be linked with it,\" reported APP.

       " ['nan nan On the afternoon of February 5-citizens in Bucharest marched simultaneously from several neighbourhoods across the city, converging on Piata Victoriei where the government building is located. The symbolism of this march was splendid: the grassroots coming together from the smallest corners to stand up to a central government perceived as abusive. For the past fortnight, hundreds of thousands have been demonstrating, first weekly, then daily, across all of Romania against two government proposals that would have seen those guilty of abuse in office pardoned or having their sentence reduced.  Then on the night of February 4, the Social-Democratic Party (PSD) which controls the government had announced tht it would withdraw the executive decree reducing some corruption sentences which had drawn the most public criticism. While people gathered in Piata Victoriei and elsewhere celebrated this victory, they also knew that the PSD would still try to push ahead with the measures. In the most likely scenario, the proposed legal changes will be put to vote in a parliament dominated by the PSD. The continuation of protests on February 5 despite the government\\'s announcement was meant to show the executive that it was being watched carefully. Protests may quiet down over the next days but they will most likely pick up once the laws get close to a parliamentary vote. The legal jargon around the two PSD legislative proposals was so complicated that even legal experts were struggling to figure out what was going on. But the nuances of the debate were not lost to protesters. As some in the crowd started asking for the resignation of the government, others immediately pointed out that the government had to stay until it withdrew the executive order and only then resign, otherwise the measures would have legal effect. This is evidence of the high level of sophistication among protesters, many of whom have participated in several waves of demonstrations in Romania since 2012 and become skillful at calling public institutions to account, communicating and organising. The strength of the protests of the past week cannot be understood without looking back at the past years of social mobilisation in Romania. This did not come out of the blue. Protest mobilisation coalesced for the first time during anti-austerity protests in 2012 but it became really powerful during 2013 when weekly protests were staged across the country to save the village of Rosia Montana from a cyanide-based gold mining project. It defeated the PSD government then, which emboldened it. Street protests stopped for a while but returned whenever there was something at stake: fighting deforestation, protecting green spaces in cities or changing electoral laws to make space for smaller parties and independents. New independent media and local activist groups were born. Mass demonstrations happened again after the Colectiv nightclub fire that killed 64 people in Bucharest in 2015. That tragedy revived investigative journalism that revealed criminal flaws in the functioning of the Romanian medical system. A few years ago, during one of the protests, an activist held a banner with the words \"A quarter of century of solitude\". Referring to the famous novel of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the protester, a historian and activist who had dedicated his adult life to mobilising young people towards civic involvement, was possibly reflecting on how daunting the task was. Like other post-communist countries, Romanian society was known for its low levels of civic involvement and solidarity. Fear of the Securitate - the secret police - during communism followed by the aggressive individualism of capitalism had left Romania\\'s social fabric in tatters. Those speaking about collective political action were seen as freaks. But within little more than five years this has changed. When the PSD unveiled the corruption laws, people knew what they had to do - get together in the streets and protest. It had become a familiar practice. Last week\\'s protests were the biggest since the fall of communism and participation was diverse, across age groups, economic class and political values. Moral outrage against a government ready to circumvent democratic process to serve its members\\' interests united people. At the same time small gestures of solidarity popped up such as restaurants offering free food and warm tea and hotels offering accommodation to those travelling to Bucharest to protest. Romania\\'s street protests will not solve the country\\'s problems. - A historical photograph from the bloody 1989 anti-communist revolution has been in circulation recently showing a young man holding a sign saying: \"We are here so that our children can be free\". It was echoed last week by young people, the children of the 1989 demonstrators, holding banners saying: \"We are still in the streets protesting\". The post-communist transition failed in many ways in Romania: primarily, because poverty levels are still staggering and the lives of working people still precarious. The PSD\\'s attack on democratic practices in order to pardon the corrupt indicated another failure: even the fundamentals of democracy have been under threat. But while a decade ago, Romanians would complain that they are a passive society not responding to abuse from the rich and powerful, today it is different. On February 4 in Bucharest, a children\\'s protest took place in Piata Victoriei, with families bringing their youngsters out on to the streets to teach them the value of civic involvement. The Romanian state is still failing most of its citizens, but something changed. Many are ready to do their it to help. Authoritarian regimes are rising everywhere in the world, not just in post-socialist Eastern Europe where democracies were always thought to be fragile. Last week, the-PSD gave a first sign that it was ready to sacrifice democratic processes for its own interests-and justify it with redistributive measures that are desperately needed. OPINION: Romania - Keep the corrupt in jail, where they belong The citizen response this past week has dealt a severe blow to the PSD. The party may have thought that winning elections by 45 percent allowed it to do whatever it wanted for the next four years, but protesters insisted the election result was not a blank cheque. Romania\\'s street protests will not solve the country\\'s problems. Failing public institutions, poverty and inequality, racism among others are very real problems that need to be addressed by wise policies and the political will to carry them through. If they are not dealt with, parties like the PSD will always try to exploit those failures for political benefit.-Romania desperately needs an alternative to the PSD on the left that could tackle these issues effectively. The demonstrations show that citizen power can check abuses by the powerful. In a world where our tolerance for such abuse seems to be increasing by the day, that\\'s an extraordinarily hopeful development. Claudia Ciobanu is a Romanian freelance reporter based in Warsaw.

Failed comeback Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy is to face trial on charges of illegally financing his failed 2012 re-election bid, according to prosecutors. One of the two investigating magistrates in charge of the case decided that it should go to trial,-a legal source told AFP news agency on Tuesday.  The prosecution claims Sarkozy spent nearly double the legal limit of $24m on his lavish campaign, using false billing from a public relations firm called Bygmalion. It is understood that 13 other individuals will also go on trial over the so-called \"Bygmalion Affair\".- Sarkozy\\'s lawyer announced plans to appeal the decision. Bygmalion charged $16.2m in campaign events to Sarkozy\\'s party - which at the time was called the UMP but has since been renamed the Republicans - instead of billing the president\\'s campaign. Sarkozy, who failed in a presidential comeback bid last year after losing to ex-Prime Minister Francois Fillon, has previously told investigators he knew nothing about the billing and put the responsibility squarely on Bygmalion and the UMP. OPINION: Old Sarkozy does not match new France\\'s needs If convicted,-Sarkozy, 62, faces up to a year in a prison.-He could yet be spared trial, however, given that the second investigating magistrate in the case disagreed that Sarkozy be put in the dock. Only one other president - Jacques Chirac - has been tried in France\\'s Fifth Republic, which was founded in 1958. He was given a two-year suspended jail term in 2011 over a fake job scandal.- The son of a Hungarian immigrant father, Sarkozy, was nicknamed the \"bling-bling\" president for his flashy displays of wealth. His trial will focus on whether he himself caused the over-spending in 2012 by demanding that additional rallies be organised towards the end of his campaign, even though they were bound to blow the budget. The judicial source said he was accused of having ignored two warnings from advisors in March and April 2012 about his spending, which came to \"at least $45.7m\". While the so-called Bygmalion case is the most pressing, Sarkozy has been fighting legal problems on several fronts. He is charged with corruption and influence peddling for allegedly offering to help a judge swing a plum retirement job in return from secret information about another case. He has also been accused by former members of-Moammar-Gaddafi\\'s regime of accepting millions in cash towards his first presidential campaign in 2007 from the-toppled Libyan leader- claims he has vehemently denied. After retiring from politics following his 2012 defeat by the Socialist Party\\'s Francois Hollande, he returned to take the helm of the Republicans and sought the party\\'s presidential nod in this year\\'s election. In a surprise result, he was eliminated in November in the first round of a primary contest, trailing the eventual winner, Fillon, and Alain Juppe, another ex-prime minister. News of Sarkozy\\'s trial comes as Fillon faces his own scandal over parliamentary jobs for his family. The presidential candidate apologised on Monday for employing his wife over 15 years as an aide - which is legal - but continued to deny the more serious allegations that she barely worked for her average monthly salary of around $3,950.

Farah bombing A suspected suicide bomber has targeted the Supreme Court building in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing at least 20 people, according to officials. Ismail Kawasi, the public health ministry spokesman, said 41 people were also wounded in Tuesday\\'s explosion, which hit near a side door used for court employees to leave the building at the end of the work day. The attacker was on foot and detonated his suicide vest packed with explosives near the employees and other people as they were coming out of the main court building,-Najib Danish, deputy spokesman for the interior ministry, told the Associated Press news agency. INTERACTIVE: Afghanistan civilian casualties reaches record high No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack but Taliban fighters have attacked the top court and its employees in the past, as well as court buildings in the other provinces. \"This is not the first attack that targeted Afghan justice system,\" Al Jazeera\\'s-Qais Azimy, reporting from Kabul, said. \"In fact the exact location, the car park of the supreme court, was targeted before in June 2013 by a suicide bomber, which killed 17 people.\" \"That\\'s why this part of the compound is heavily guarded and the employees of this court know that they are targets for Taliban,\" Azimy said. The armed group has repeatedly issued statements threatening to target employees at Afghanistan\\'s justice system \"because they are not happy with the way they are working\", our correspondent added. The Kabul bombing came hours after a roadside bombing killed the top government official of a district in western Farah province. Taliban spokesman Qari Yusouf Ahmadi said the group claimed responsibility for that attack. A Farah police spokesman, Iqbal Baher, told AP that Abdul Khaliq, the top official in the Khak-e-Safed district, was on his way home from the mosque when the explosion took place in the city of Farah, the provincial capital. Taliban fighters frequently use roadside bombs and suicide attacks to target government officials as well as Afghan security forces across the country. Source:-Al Jazeera and news agencies'],\n",

Dozens of people, including civilians, have been killed in air strikes on the rebel-held Syrian city of Idlib, according to several sources, in some of the most ferocious raids there in months. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Tuesday that at least 26 people were killed and casualties were expected to rise as rescue workers searched for bodies under the rubble. \"Ten civilians, mostly women, are among the dead,\" Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the UK-based monitoring group tracking development\\'s in Syria\\'s conflict, told AFP news agency. READ MORE: Idlib\\'s rebel split - A crossroads for Syrian opposition Abdel Rahman said the raids were probably carried out by Russian fighter jets - allied with Syria\\'s government - or by a US-backed air coalition. The strikes also wounded scores of people and levelled several multi-storey buildings in residential areas of the northwestern city, according to witnesses, who told Reuters news agency that the extent of the damage and the debris bore the hallmarks of a Russian attack. But Russia\\'s defence ministry said later on Tuesday media reports that its planes had bombed Idlib were not true, Interfax news agency reported. The Civil Defence, a volunteer rescue group operating in rebel-held areas, gave a different death toll, saying 15 bodies were pulled from the rubble and that 30 wounded people were taken for treatment. READ MORE: Syria hanged 13,000 in notorious prison, says Amnesty Video footage by activists on social media showed civilians, including young children, being treated in a main city hospital where the injured had been taken for treatment.  \"We are still pulling bodies from the rubble,\" Issam al Idlibi, a volunteer civil defence worker, told Reuters. Russian planes have targeted a number of towns and villages in the area since entering the Syrian conflict in September 2015 to back ally President Bashar al-Assad. Activists and residents said there had been a reduction of Russian strikes in Idlib province since a Turkish-Russian brokered cessation of hostilities late December. Planes from the US-led coalition have launched a number of attacks in the rural province, a major stronghold of fighters, many of them formerly affiliated to al-Qaeda. Idlib\\'s population has been swollen by thousands of Syrian fighters and their families evacuated from villages and towns around Damascus and Aleppo city, which was retaken by the government in recent months.

Somalia\\'s capital is on lockdown a day before the parliament meets to elect a new president, with ongoing security concerns and warnings of famine expected to top the agenda for the incoming administration.- Roads in Mogadishu were closed, businesses asked to shut, and schools and universities gave students a two-day break. In the run-up to the election, al-Shabab fighters have stepped up their attacks against government installations and- hotels in the capital .- Bishar Abshir, Mogadishu police chief, told Al Jazeera that security forces were working to ensure that the election is concluded peacefully. \"We appeal to the public to be patient and cooperate with us as we deter the enemies of peace from carrying out attacks,\" he told Al Jazeera. Al-Shabab, which aims -to topple the country\\'s UN-backed government,- has carried out- hundreds of attacks -in Somalia.- INTERACTIVE: Al-Shabab attacks in Somalia (2006-2017) The presidential election had been due to take place in August, four years after the previous vote in which just 135 clan elders chose MPs who then voted for the country\\'s leader. But political infighting and insecurity, mainly due to al-Shabab, which controls swaths of countryside and strikes at will in Mogadishu, saw the plan ditched for a limited vote running months behind schedule. The troubled Horn of Africa nation, which has not had an effective central government in three decades, had been promised a one-person, one-vote election in 2016. Elections instead began in October with an electoral college system that excluded ordinary citizens and instead involved 14,025 delegates voting for candidates for both parliament and a new upper house. President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud of the conservative Peace and Development Party is seeking a second term after more than four years in office, during which he has faced criticism from the public and western donors about corruption. Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke, a former diplomat, and former president Sharif Sheikh Ahmed are also among the 24 candidates registered for the election. About a third of MPs are loyal to the president\\'s party. While this gives Mohamud an advantage in the race, it is not enough to guarantee him victory. The elections have been marred by widespread allegations of vote-buying and intimidation. In a report on Tuesday, Somalia-based anti-corruption watchdog Marqaati said the elections \"were rife with corruption\".  READ MORE: Al-Shabab attack at Mogadishu hotel \\'kills 28\\' While falling well short of the direct election that was promised, the process is more democratic than in the past and is seen as a step towards universal suffrage, now hoped for in 2020. Wednesday\\'s voting will see members of the 275-seat parliament and 54 senators cast ballots inside a hangar within the heavily-guarded airport. No candidate is expected to get the two-thirds majority needed for a first-round win, with two further rounds permitted before a winner is declared. In the absence of political parties, clan remains the organising principle of Somali politics. The overthrow of president Siad Barre\\'s military regime in 1991 ushered in decades of anarchy and conflict in a country deeply divided along clan lines.  The clan rivalries and lawlessness provided fertile ground for al-Shabab to take hold and seize territory, frustrating efforts to set up a central administration. Al-Shabab has been in decline since 2011, but still launches regular, deadly attacks against government, military and civilian targets in the capital Mogadishu and elsewhere. Security and overcoming Somalia\\'s adversarial and divisive politics will top the agenda for whoever wins the vote, as will dealing with a growing humanitarian crisis. The United Nations warned last week of \"possible famine\" in Somalia as a severe drought has pushed nearly three million people to the edge of starvation. After two failed rain seasons, aid workers fear a repeat of a 2010-11 drought which left more than 250,000 dead. \"The levels of suffering in the country, triggered by protracted conflict, seasonal shocks and outbreaks of disease, are typically hard to bear, but the impact of this drought represents a threat of a different scale and magnitude,\" the UN\\'s office for humanitarian affairs said in a statement last week.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said that he was grateful to US President Donald Trump for revealing \"the real face of America\". \"We are thankful to this gentleman ... he showed the real face of America,\" Khamenei said in a speech to military officers in Tehran on Tuesday. \"[It was] what we have said for more than 30 years - that there is political, economic, moral and social corruption in the ruling system of the US. This gentleman came and brought it out into the open in the election and after the election.\" He referred to the case of a young Iranian boy who was pictured in handcuffs at a US airport following Trump\\'s ban on visas from Iran, among other countries. \"By what he does - handcuffing a five-year-old child - he shows the true meaning of American human rights,\" Khamenei said. Iran is one of the seven predominantly Muslim countries that the Trump administration tried to ban from entering the US. The related executive order last week was frozen by the US judiciary and an appeals court is to hear Trump\\'s latest arguments to reinstate the ban. Khamenei-also responded to Trump\\'s tweet of February 3, when the US president said: \"Iran is playing with fire - they don\\'t appreciate how \\'kind\\' President Obama was to them.\" He ridiculed the idea of being grateful to former President Barack Obama, saying he was the one who placed \"paralysing sanctions\" on Iran and helped create the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) group through his destabilising actions in Iraq and Syria.

       " ['nan nan The first Grad multiple launch rockets were fired from areas under Kremlin-backed militant control hit Avdiivka in eastern Ukraine only a day after US President Donald Trump held his first official phone call with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. While some viewed the timing of this attack as a chilling confirmation of the new United States administration\\'s willingness to make deals with Moscow at Ukraine\\'s expense, neither the motives behind the sudden escalation, nor-its-effect on the current situation are that straightforward. There were certainly grounds for concern and the feeling of-angst, only strengthened when a Kremlin spokesperson said that the recent escalation in Ukraine proved the need for \"dialogue\" between the US and Russia.- It is implementation of the Minsk Agreement that is required, not \"dialogue\". This, however, includes a ceasefire, withdrawal of all heavy weapons-and, eventually, the securing of the Russian-Ukrainian border. But Russia is actively trying get the Minsk-linked sanctions lifted without fulfilling the commitments it made. The fears of some Ukrainians that the new US administration may be amenable to make deals with Russia that bypass the conditions of the Minsk Agreement are not unfounded. Even if we ignore the US intelligence report demonstrating that Russia directly interfered in the US elections to get Trump elected, Trump\\'s own statements have given Ukraine reason to fear for the future of US support to Ukraine and its commitment to the sanctions. Since Russia\\'s invasion and annexation of Crimea, Trump has on numerous occasions praised Putin, even calling Russia\\'s aggression against Ukraine \"smart\". During the election campaign, he stated that they \"would be looking into\" recognising Crimea as a Russian territory and lifting sanctions on Moscow. He has even dismissed-Russia\\'s involvement in the downing of the Malaysian MH17 airliner over militant-controlled territory in July 2014 despite compelling evidence. It was after that disaster that hard-hitting sanctions were imposed on Russia and these sanctions were tied to Moscow\\'s compliance with the Minsk Agreement. Trump\\'s people have been actively meeting with Russians and fuelling Moscow\\'s hopes that sanctions will be lifted. There is also an ongoing campaign-to push the claim that sanctions \"don\\'t work\" and that Ukraine may have to \"give up\"-Crimea in exchange for some kind of a peace deal in Eastern Ukraine. The sanctions, including those over Crimea, are hurting Russia hard and the Kremlin needs them lifted. But if it hoped to steer \"dialogue\" on to such deals by escalating the conflict, its plan may have backfired. Avdiivka, a strategically important city under Ukrainian control, came under attack on January 28. A Bellingcat report has confirmed reports and videos indicating that the intensive shelling of the city was carried out from residential parts of militant-controlled Donetsk. Moscow\\'s attempt to blame Ukraine for this escalation was largely rejected by the international community, since the scale of the attack, and the use of Grad missiles and other heavy artillery makes it inconceivable that this attack was carried out without Moscow\\'s approval. Andrei Piontkovsky, a Russian political analyst, suggested that Russian military personnel may have been in charge of the operation. Western journalists who visited Avdiivka have also reported evidence of \"a psychological warfare operation of a sophistication that suggested Russian involvement\".-Ukrainian soldiers, for example, were bombarded with text messages saying: \"You\\'re just meat to your commanders.\" Another reason for assuming Russian military involvement in this attack is that the the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) officials in Vienna were warned of a likely escalation on January 26. Daniel Baer, the former US ambassador to the OSCE, recently pointed out that even if fighting is on both sides, this is still a situation where \"Ukraine is the victim and Russia the aggressor\". Baer, however, was removed on January 20, and it remains to be seen whether the new US Mission to the OSCE will continue to take a firm stand on this issue. This is, after all, the critical question. Whether or not the order came from the Kremlin directly, Ukraine is in no doubt that Moscow\\'s primary aim remains the same - to retain its grip on Ukraine through the debilitating and destabilising effect of the conflict in Eastern Ukraine. The so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People\\'s Republics are entirely artificial creations, propped by Russian money, weapons and fighters. Real implementation of the Minsk Agreement would almost certainly lead to their collapse. The militants themselves have acknowledged having no interest in the Minsk Agreement working. READ MORE: Losing everything in Avdiivka Russia knows this and does not want to relinquish its control over Ukraine. The Russian-backed militants continue to delay releasing hostages and violate ceasefires. The White House was very slow in reacting to the new escalation and during his phone conversation with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, Trump only mentioned, rather oddly, that the US is willing to help \"restore peace along the border\". Nonetheless Nikki Haley, the new US Ambassador to the UN, has come out with a clear statement indicating that there is no change in policy, either on Crimea or on the Minsk agreements. This leaves Russia with the option of trying to discredit the Minsk agreements inside Ukraine or to prove that Kiev is at fault. One motive for the carnage and suffering caused in Avdiivka may have been to convince Ukrainians - and perhaps the US - that the Minsk accords are not working and should be abandoned. If the Trump administration is hoping to come to some kind of arrangement with Putin, it would probably want to avoid doing so by lifting sanctions when agreement conditions have not been met, and when other countries are standing by them. There are certainly voices of disgruntlement inside Ukraine, but there is understanding that the removal of sanctions against Russia will encourage its aggression further. As political commentator Serhiy Taran warned, if Ukraine turns away from the Minsk Agreement, there will be no western leverage to put pressure on Russia. Moscow may, however, have made one other miscalculation. In 2014, Ukraine was in no state to defend itself properly after four years of the Viktor Yanukovych regime. During the latest offensive, the country showed its strength. There was extraordinarily efficient cooperation between the military, government agencies and civilian organisations ensuring that people in the besieged city cut off from electricity and heating had somewhere to go. In other cities, hundreds waited patiently to donate blood. Ukraine is not broken and will defend itself. The latest offensive has, nonetheless, demonstrated how cynically Moscow will use weapons of death and destruction for its own questionable gains. This is a lesson the new Trump administration would do well to heed before attempting any deals with Putin. Halya Coynash is a journalist and member of the Kharkiv Human Rights Group.

The snowstorm that blanketed Seattle and Western Washington State, causing huge travel delays and major power cuts. Dozens of schools were forced to close, much to the delight of many of the pupils. Dozens of flights were cancelled at Seattle-Tacoma Airport-due to snow and ice and more than 90,000 customers found themselves without electricity at some stage.

By Ramallah - Palestinian politicians and human rights groups are warning that a new law passed by the Israeli parliament violates international laws and is a step towards Israel annexing the occupied West Bank. The so-called Regulation Law, passed on Monday night, allows for the retroactive legalisation of about 4,000 homes built by Jewish settlers on privately owned Palestinian land. \"The law sets a new legal framework that implements the Israeli political interest and puts it above international humanitarian law,\"-Suhad Bishara, a lawyer at the Adalah legal centre for Arab minority rights in Israel, told Al Jazeera. The law violates both the right to property and the right to dignity, Bishara said. \"The most obvious case here is that it violates property rights, because it basically confiscates private property for the sake of the illegal settlers,\" she said. \"But we cannot avoid the aspect of dignity here, and humiliation, and no value at all for the rights of the Palestinian owners of the land.\" READ MORE: Israel\\'s settlement bill \\'big step towards annexation\\' Before the bill was passed, Israel\\'s attorney general said that it was unconstitutional and that he would not be able to defend it. Along with other rights groups, Adalah is set to file a petition against the law to Israel\\'s Supreme Court later this week, as well as asking for a temporary order not to implement the law until Israel\\'s highest court gives a final decision. According to the Israeli rights group Peace Now, the law will allow for the expropriation of land in more than 50 settlements and outposts. There are 16 cases where demolition orders have already been issued by Israeli authorities, including land in the settlements of Ofra, Eli and Beit El, among others. As a result of the new law, the settlers in these illegal outposts would be allowed to remain in their homes. Palestinian lawmakers in the Knesset denounced the law, calling it a direct challenge to the international community in the wake of December\\'s United Nations Security Council resolution that called for an end to settlement building. \"From the political point of view and from the legal point of view, this law should not have been legislated. This is a law that is meant to implement the creeping annexation of Palestinian occupied lands to Israel,\" Aida Touma-Suleiman, an MK with the Arab Joint List, told Al Jazeera. \"This is a law that is challenging the international community. It\\'s arrogant behaviour by this government, who are not willing to pay attention to what the international community is [saying]. It is about time to hold them responsible for the decisions and laws they are legislating.\" Gilad Grossman, a spokesperson for the Israeli human rights NGO Yesh Din, said that the law has stripped Palestinian landowners of any chance to reclaim their land. \"What it means is that Palestinian landowners can\\'t get their land back, whether they want to or not,\" he said. READ MORE: Palestinians call Israel settlement expansion a \\'war crime\\' As a result of the new law, Palestinian landowners only have the option of financial compensation, Grossman added - \"to go through the system of the people who stole your land and to ask for them to give you some money, as much as they decide to give you, on the conditions they decide with the proof they demand\". The ownership of the land itself will remain in the hands of the Palestinian landowners, although they will not be able to access or use it. \"It\\'s a very cynical law,\" Grossman noted. \"It basically means that they own the land and can get it back in the future, if there will be some kind of political agreement and decision regarding the West Bank. It was stolen and now it\\'s being leased against their will basically, and there\\'s nothing they can do about it.\" On Tuesday morning, Israel\\'s high court ruled that 17 buildings in the illegal outpost of Tapuach Maarav would have to be demolished by 2018.

       " ['nan nan Kabul has joined Moscow, Tel Aviv and a few other capitals in welcoming Donald Trump\\'s presidential administration. Although Trump has not yet elaborated on his policy towards Afghanistan, his harsh and blunt criticisms of Washington\\'s ills, of the-opportunistic and duplicitous US-allies and of the US\\' failure to win wars resonate with many Afghans. Trump is the fifth US president to deal with Afghanistan as a central foreign policy issue and national security concern. For his four predecessors - Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George W Bush and Barack Obama - Afghanistan was an inescapable crisis and an inherited challenge.  The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the terrorist attacks of 9/11 made the country one of Washington\\'s foreign policy priorities for nearly four decades. Trump has now inherited a 16-year-old conflict with direct US military involvement and a political quagmire within a regime it helped install. Kabul is paralysed by a stalled political process, rampant corruption, a resilient terrorist group and Pakistan\\'s stubborn obsession with making Afghanistan its strategic depth. On his first day of his presidency, Trump encouraged US soldiers based in Afghanistan, saying, \"Keep fighting. We\\'re going to win. We\\'re going to win.\"-As a hyper self-confident businessman with impeccable corporate skill, to win in Afghanistan where Obama failed, Trump needs to know that he cannot go about business as usual. In the coming weeks, Trump and his national security team will be reading and listening to many assessments and proposals on the way forward in Afghanistan. The new US administration must begin by critically examining Washington\\'s assumptions, approaches and partners in Afghanistan in a broader regional and global context. One prevailing assumption in Washington is the perception of the US\\' misplaced priority in promoting \"nation-building\" in Afghanistan, compounded by rampant Afghan corruption. OPINION: No consensus in Afghanistan on how to deal with Taliban Both Obama and Trump have criticised US involvement in \"nation-building\" in Afghanistan and promised to end it. However, neither of them defined or clarified their understanding of \"nation-building\". This confusion has been exacerbated by Washington\\'s simplistic and partial understanding of the root causes of corruption in Afghanistan and its denial of western entities having a role in it. The massive waste, incompetence, corruption, hypocrisy, and unaccountability within western entities are actually significantly under-reported. The recently released report on the massive $125bn waste in the Pentagon, or the leaked information on the monthly payment of $150,000 by Ashraf Ghani\\'s election team to influence Washington\\'s view on fraud during the 2014 Afghan presidential election, show that corruption is not exclusively an oriental sin. To paraphrase former US Sectary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, the mission no longer determines the coalition in Afghanistan; instead, the many coalition members determine the mission, which results in incoherence and contradictions. - Afghanistan is the place where Trump\\'s criticism of NATO and European performance are valid. The US has two types of European and NATO partners in Afghanistan: the reluctant partners and the dubious ones. The former are some European allies, who would literally not fight after tea time due to the restriction on their combat role; the latter are those who systematically undermine US objectives by legitimising the Taliban in the guise of peace talks and shielding Pakistan\\'s detrimental policies in Afghanistan. To paraphrase former US Sectary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, the mission no longer determines the coalition in Afghanistan; instead, the many coalition members determine the mission, which has resulted in incoherence and contradictions. Regional policy and the choice of regional partners is another area where Washington made a huge mistake. US policies have been primarily Pakistan-centric. As early as 2003, Pakistan\\'s duplicitous role was recognised by US intelligence and diplomatic stations in the region, but Washington chose to ignore their warnings. Despite growing evidence of Pakistan\\'s systematic support to various terrorist groups and its nuclear proliferation, Pakistan was recognised as US\\' major non-NATO ally in 2004 and has received more than $30bn of military and economic assistance since 2002 (PDF). On the other hand, US\\' natural ally in the region, India, has been constantly discouraged from assuming an active role in stabilising Afghanistan. Washington\\'s wrong assumptions about Afghanistan and its unreliable Afghan partners compounded its other misfortune. Washington allowed British colonial thinking, Pakistan\\'s hegemonic agenda and a number of Afghan-Americans\\' personal and ethnic ambitions to manipulate Washington\\'s mindset and shape US policies and strategies in Afghanistan. These intellectual manipulations and misunderstandings resulted in three principal political and institutional errors. One is imposing one of the world\\'s most rigid centralised political orders on one of the world\\'s most diverse societies. This was followed by the institutionalisation of patronage politics and of political domination enjoyed by self-proclaimed representatives of one ethnic group at the expense of the consolidation of democratic politics. Washington\\'s ambiguous relations with the Taliban was the third mistake. Despite Taliban\\'s consistent actions and rhetoric confirming they are an integral part of radical Islamist movements, the US diplomats and Obama administration treated the Taliban as a-misguided-indigenous rural Pashtun group. Unlike Syria which has become a land of no options, the post-Taliban political structure in Afghanistan still enjoys broad domestic, regional and international support, including bipartisan backing in the US.  The new US administration has to strengthen the principal foundation of this architecture: democratic and inclusive politics, regional consensus, and long-term international support, including US commitment to the Afghanistan-US Bilateral Security Agreement. This has to be reinforced by addressing the wrong assumptions of the previous administrations, confronting Afghan and regional spoilers and fixing incompetencies in Washington and within the coalition. Obama\\'s Afghan policy was premised on the idea of \"peace through appeasement\". But the Afghan war can only be won by \"peace through strength\", which can only be achieved through a functioning democratic and sovereign political order in Kabul. Afghanistan is the place where Islamic radicalism was born and nurtured by the West, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and even Maoist China, in their ideological and geostrategic competition with the Soviet Union (PDF). Although the US succeeded in defeating its arch communist rival in Afghanistan in the 1980s, it has been struggling to defeat its new global enemy: terrorist groups. Its victory in Afghanistan will also affect the global struggle against this threat, both symbolically and strategically. Davood Moradian is the director-general of the Afghan Institute for Strategic Studies and former chief of programmes in President Hamid Karzai\\'s office and chief policy adviser to Afghanistan\\'s ministry of foreign affairs.

       " ['Israeli torture of Palestinian children \\'institutional\\' Ben White Confessions by Palestinians who have been tortured are regularly accepted by Israeli judges, rights groups say. By - Coercion, violence and threats: Torture, Israeli-style A recent-article published by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz has confirmed the extent to which Shin Bet interrogators subject their prisoners to torture. Methods include slapping the head \"to hurt sensitive organs like the nose, ears, brow and lips\", forcing a handcuffed individual to squat against a wall for long periods of time, and placing the suspect bent backwards over a chair with his arms and legs cuffed. The interrogators\\' accounts echo what Palestinians and Israeli human rights groups-have long documented. Prisoners\\' rights NGO Addameer said that such practices \"are known to be routinely and systematically used against Palestinian detainees\". Other torture methods used against Palestinians include sleep deprivation and threats against family members, an Addameer spokesperson told Al Jazeera. READ MORE: Palestinians forever changed by Israeli torture Rachel Stroumsa, the executive director of the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI), said that her NGO was aware of hundreds of complaints and allegations along these lines. In addition to interrogation being used to gain information about future acts, \"our experience is that torture is also used to obtain confessions regarding past acts\", Stroumsa told Al Jazeera. In its annual-report-last year, Amnesty International found that Israeli forces and Shin Bet personnel had \"tortured and otherwise ill-treated Palestinian detainees, including children, particularly during arrest and interrogation\", with methods including \"beating with batons, slapping, throttling, prolonged shackling, stress positions, sleep deprivation and threats\". A representative of Defence for Children International - Palestine told Al Jazeera that the group\\'s research had shown that almost two-thirds of Palestinian children detained in the occupied West Bank by Israeli forces had endured physical violence after their arrest. Interrogators use position abuse, threats and isolation to coerce confessions from some children, and Israeli military court judges seldom exclude these confessions. Ayed Abu Qtaish, accountability programme director at Defence for Children International - Palestine \"Palestinian children are regularly subjected to coercive and violent interrogation techniques intended to extract confessions,\" said Ayed Abu Qtaish, the group\\'s accountability programme director. \"Interrogators use position abuse, threats and isolation to coerce confessions from some children, and Israeli military court judges seldom exclude these confessions.\" Torture and ill-treatment are so rife, human rights campaigners say, that convictions of Palestinians for \"security offences\" are fundamentally unreliable, not least because the abuse is part of a wider lack of due process. According to one study, as many as 91 percent of Palestinian detainees interrogated by the Shin Bet in the occupied West Bank-are held incommunicado for either part or all of their interrogation. Stroumsa says this practice is \"an enabling element for torture\". In the military court system, which has a 99 percent conviction rate, Palestinians can be held for 60 days without access to a lawyer - compared with-the United States, where the average length of interrogations producing false confessions is 16 hours. \"As Palestinian children continue to experience systematic ill-treatment and denial of due process rights, it becomes evident that military courts have no interest in justice,\" Abu Qtaish said.  In addition to the torture and lack of access to counsel, Palestinians are asked to sign confession sheets in Hebrew, which they often do not understand. All of this \"creates a coercive environment which results in confessions made under duress\", Addameer noted.- A recent example is the case of Mohammad el-Halabi, a Gaza-based employee of World Vision who was charged by Israel with funnelling money to Hamas. Halabi, who is being tried in a Beer Sheva civilian court, has protested his innocence, saying that he was tortured by his interrogators. These claims were also made by his lawyers, who Halabi was prevented from seeing for three weeks after his arrest. The new Haaretz report draws attention to a topic that is not often in the limelight. In November 2015, a video of the interrogation of 13-year-old Ahmad Manasra sparked outrage, while Israel\\'s appearance at the United Nations Committee Against Torture last May - which referred to \"coerced evidence\" being used in courts - also gained coverage. But many other events fly under the radar. An academic study published in November 2015 in a peer-reviewed medical journal revealed dozens of cases of sexual torture and ill-treatment of Palestinian prisoners detained by Israel. READ MORE: Report details \\'inhuman\\' treatment in Israeli jail Activists on the ground say that an international spotlight on Israel\\'s torture practices is urgently needed, not least because of the institutionalised nature of the problem.- Although an Israeli Supreme Court ruling in 1999 prohibited \"physical means\" of interrogation, Shin Bet agents were effectively given impunity for torture and ill-treatment by the so-called \"necessity defence\" or \" ticking bomb\" exemption. According to anti-torture campaigners, this exemption has served as a green light for torture ever since. Since 2001, hundreds of formal complaints have been made against Shin Bet interrogators, but not a single criminal investigation has been opened. \"I think international pressure is essential, and has on some issues proven its efficacy,\" Stroumsa said. \"It is also the duty of the international community to speak out on abuses, given the massive economic and political support for the State of Israel from abroad.\" Source:-Al Jazeera'],\n",

Dutch far-right MP Geert Wilders, known for his comments attacking Islam and Muslims, has triggered a fight over fake news, after posting a Twitter message showing a digitally altered picture of another party leader at a rally. Some five weeks before key elections in The Netherlands, Wilders on Monday posted the fake picture of D66 leader Alexander Pechtold supposedly at a rally with Muslims holding up signs reading: \"Islam will conquer Europe\" and \"Shariah for The Netherlands\", referring to Islamic law. Wilders\\' anti-Islam and anti-immigrant platform has helped propel his Freedom Party (PVV) to the top of the opinion polls in recent months in advance of the March 15 vote.

Wilders\\' taunt prompted an angry reaction from Pechtold. \"Usually, I laugh at Photoshopped pictures on the internet. But not this time,\" he wrote on his Facebook page. \"Not because I can\\'t stand up for myself ... but because it gives people false impressions.\"  Last year, Pechtold sued a PVV supporter over photos that sparked death threats against him. \"In these times of fake news and alternative facts, we can\\'t just ignore the consequences that such a fake image can have,\" he said. \"I draw the line today.\" The AFP news agency reported that other politicians also sided with Pechtold.

Residents of Yakla, an impoverished Yemeni town that was targeted last month in the first US military raid in the country authorised by President Donald Trump, have said more than a dozen civilians were killed in the botched operation. Locals told Al Jazeera that at least-16 civilians, including women and children, were killed in the raid in Bayda province that also resulted in the death of one US commando and injured three others. The Pentagon said the raid, which included-helicopter gunships and armed Reaper drones,-targeted al-Qaeda leaders. But local journalist Mujahid al-Selalee said Abdulraouf al-Dhahab,-a tribal leader whose house was attacked in the raid,-had repeatedly denied being a member of the armed group.- \"He [Dhahab] made clear on numerous occasions that he has no ties with al-Qaeda. He denied that over and over and we know that based on those living with him,\" Selalee told Al Jazeera. \"One of his brothers was associated with al-Qaeda, but he was killed by a drone a while back.\" Al-Qaeda mourned Dhahab\\'s death, calling him a \"holy warrior\", and vowed to avenge him and other slain fighters. In an initial statement, the Pentagon-said it killed 14 members of al-Qaeda, but soon released a second statement admitting that the raid \"likely\" killed civilians as well. Nora, the eight-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, a US-born Yemeni preacher who was killed in a 2011 drone attack, was among the victims, family members said. Her grandfather, Nasser al-Awlaki, a former minister of agriculture, said:-\"She was hit with a bullet in her neck and suffered for two hours\".- He told reporters that she was visiting her mother when the raid took place.

Al-Qaeda has-exploited Yemen\\'s two-year-civil war that pits Shia Houthi fighters against the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and has carried out assassinations and bombings, mostly in areas across the south.

       " ['Israel approves controversial settlement expansion bill Palestinian leaders condemn bill that legalises nearly 4,000 settler homes, calling it \\'theft\\' of Palestinian land. Amona demolitions Israel has passed a controversial bill that retroactively legalises thousands of settler homes built on privately owned Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank, drawing widespread anger by Palestinian leaders and rights groups. The Israeli Knesset voted 60 to 52 to approve the contentious bill late on Monday- despite warnings by the government\\'s top lawyer who had previously called it \"unconstitutional\". Minutes after the vote, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) slammed the new law as a means to \"legalise theft\" of Palestinian land. The law demonstrated \"the Israeli government\\'s will to destroy any chances for a political solution,\" the PLO said in a statement, stressing that the \"Israeli settlement enterprise negates peace and the possibility of the two-state solution\". The so-called \"Regulation Bill\" applies to about 4,000 settlement homes in the West Bank for which settlers could prove ignorance that they had built on privately owned land and had received encouragement from the Israeli state to do so. The bill is seen as another step towards at least partial annexation of the West Bank, and could lead to a host of illegal settlements built on privately owned Palestinian land being legalised retroactively. Three Israeli NGOs - Peace Now, Yesh Din and the Association for Civil Rights in Israel - said they intend to petition the Supreme Court to cancel the law. \"This law will make theft an official Israeli policy by retroactively legalising illegal construction on private lands,\" said Anat Ben Nun, a spokesman for the -anti-settlement organisation-Peace Now. READ MORE: Israel\\'s settlement bill \\'big step towards annexation\\' International law considers all settlements to be illegal, but Israel distinguishes between those it sanctions and those it does not, dubbed outposts. The bill was a key demand for parts of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\\'s right-wing cabinet, including the hardline Jewish Home party, which argues that-settlers would be able to live without fear of being driven from their homes - many of which they have lived in for years.  The government\\'s attorney general, however, has said that the bill was unconstitutional and would contradict Israel\\'s legal obligations under international law. Israeli MK Tzipi Livni warned that it would lead Israeli soldiers to the International Criminal Court. The bill would apply to 53 other outposts and homes within existing settlements recognised by Israel built on Palestinian land, according to Peace Now. More than 3,800 homes would be \"legalised\", the NGO said. READ MORE: Palestinians decry Israel\\'s settlement bill The parliamentary session before the final readings began on Monday afternoon but was adjourned a short while later after all opposition members withdrew their reservations. Dov Khenin of the Arab Joint List said the opposition would not cooperate with the bill\\'s legislative process, accusing its proponents of acting counter to regulations. Though passed, the bill could still be challenged. Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said last week: \"The chance that it will be struck down by the Supreme Court is 100 percent.\" Al Jazeera\\'s Imran Khan, reporting from West Jerusalem, said -the Palestinian land owners could take their case to the Supreme Court as early as Tuesday. \"The Palestinian Authority says it has to see what happens next, and [will decide] whether they have to go to the ICC or the UN,\" he added. Last week, a few hundred residents of the Amona outpost in the West Bank were evicted after the Supreme Court ruled that their homes were built on private Palestinian land. In parliament on Monday, Shuli Mualem, of Jewish Home, dedicated the law to the people evicted from Amona. The lengthy Amona saga - including the evictions broadcast live on Israeli television - directly inspired the bill.  Nickolay Mladenov, the United Nations envoy for the Middle East peace process,-said on Monday that he was \"concerned\" by the recent bill as it would \"enable the continued use of privately owned Palestinian land for Israeli settlements\". \"If adopted into law, it will have far-reaching legal consequences for Israel and greatly diminish the prospects for Arab-Israeli peace,\" he added. Bezalel Smotrich, of the Jewish Home party, who was one of the forces behind the legislation, thanked the American people for electing Donald Trump as president, \"without whom the law would have probably not passed\". The White House\\'s immediate response was to refer to its statement last week that said the construction of new settlements \"may not be helpful\" in achieving Israeli-Palestinian peace. The state department later said: \"The Trump administration will withhold comment on the legislation until the relevant court ruling.\" Since Trump\\'s inauguration, Israel has announced more than 6,000 new homes in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, seen as key parts of any future Palestinian state. While Trump\\'s administration last week expressed reservations over Israel\\'s settlement expansion, it also broke with previous administrations by saying settlements were not an obstacle to peace. \"President Trump hasn\\'t been as strong on condemnation of settlements as previous US administrations,\" Al Jazeera\\'s Khan said.- \"With this bill, Netanyahu is playing to his domestic audience ... supporters have been pushing him to go even further. He can simply turn around and say, \\'I tried my hardest\\'.\" Under the bill, Palestinian owners would be financially compensated by Israel, but could not sell their land.

       " ['Syria\\'s Civil War Explained The Syrian civil war is the deadliest conflict the 21st century has witnessed thus far. What caused the uprising? Foreign involvement The situation today Five years since the conflict began, more than 450,000 Syrians have been killed in the fighting, more than a million injured and over 12 million Syrians - half the country\\'s prewar population - have been displaced from their homes. In 2011, what became known as the \" Arab Spring \" revolts toppled Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak . That March, peaceful protests erupted in Syria as well, after 15 boys were detained and tortured for having written graffiti in support of the Arab Spring. One of the boys, 13-year-old Hamza al-Khateeb , was killed after having been brutally tortured. The Syrian government, led by President Bashar al-Assad, responded to the protests by killing hundreds of demonstrators and imprisoning many more. In July 2011, defectors from the military announced the formation of the Free Syrian Army, a rebel group aiming to overthrow the government, and Syria began to slide into civil war. Initially, lack of freedoms and economic woes fuelled resentment of the Syrian government, and public anger was inflamed by the harsh crackdown on protesters. Successful uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt energised and gave hope to Syrian pro-democracy activists. Many Islamist movements were also strongly opposed to the Assads\\' rule. In 1982, Bashar al-Assad\\'s father, Hafez, ordered a military crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood in Hama, which killed between 10,000-40,000 people and flattened much of the city.  Even global warming has been claimed to have played a role in sparking the 2011 uprising. A severe drought plagued Syria from 2007-10, spurring as many as 1.5 million people to migrate from the countryside into cities, which exacerbated poverty and social unrest. Although the initial protests were mostly non-sectarian, armed conflict led to the emergence of starker sectarian divisions. Minority religious groups tend to support the Assad government, while the overwhelming majority of opposition fighters are Sunni Muslims. Although most Syrians are Sunni Muslims, Syria\\'s security establishment has long been dominated by members of the Alawite sect, of which Assad is a member. The sectarian split is reflected among regional actors\\' stances as well. The governments of majority-Shia Iran and Iraq support Assad, as does Lebanon-based Hezbollah ; while Sunni-majority states including Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and others staunchly support the rebels. Foreign backing and open intervention have played a large role in Syria\\'s civil war. An international coalition led by the United States has bombed-targets of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL , also known as ISIS) group since 2014. In September 2015, Russia launched a bombing campaign against what it referred to as \"terrorist groups\" in Syria, which included ISIL, as well as rebel groups backed by western states. Russia has also deployed military advisers to shore up Assad\\'s defences. Several Arab states, along with Turkey, have provided weapons and materiel to rebel groups in Syria . Many of those fighting come from outside Syria. The ranks of ISIL include a sizeable number of fighters from around the world. Lebanese members of Hezbollah are fighting on the side of Assad, as are Iranian and Afghan fighters . Although the US has stated its opposition to the Assad government, it has hesitated to involve itself deeply in the conflict, even after the Assad government allegedly used chemical weapons in 2013, which US President Barack Obama had previously referred to as a \"red line\" that would prompt intervention. In October 2015, the US scrapped its controversial programme to train Syrian rebels, after it was revealed that it had spent $500m but only trained 60 fighters.  On November 26, the Syrian army launched a military offensive on Aleppo . In less than a month, Syrian troops, with unfettered Russian air support, were able to recapture 90 percent of the eastern part of Aleppo. On December 13, the Syrian army claimed that 98 percent of east Aleppo was in the hands of Syrian government forces. Besides, Aleppo, the Syrian government currently controls the capital, Damascus, parts of southern Syria and Deir Az Zor, much of the area near the Syrian-Lebanese border, and the northwestern coastal region. Rebel groups, ISIL, and Kurdish forces control the rest of the country. Rebel groups continue to jockey against one another for power, and frequently fight each other. The Free Syrian Army has weakened as the war has progressed, while explicitly Islamist groups, such as the al-Nusra Front, that- has pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda , became empowered. Last July, al-Nusra front leader,-Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, announced his group\\'s name has also changed to Jabhat Fateh al Sham, or The Front for liberation of al Sham. In 2013, ISIL- emerged in northern and eastern Syria after overrunning large portions of Iraq. The group quickly gained international notoriety for its brutal executions and its energetic use of social media. Meanwhile, Kurdish groups in northern Syria are seeking self-rule in areas under their control. This has alarmed Turkey\\'s government, which fears its large native Kurdish population may grow more restive and demand greater autonomy as a result. Last August, Turkish troops and special forces, backed by the Free Syria Army, launched operation \"Euphrates Shield\" against ISIL to liberate the strategic Syrian city of Jarablus on the border with Turkey. Euphrates Shield operation is considered to be the first Turkish ground intervention in Syria since the Syrian crisis started in 2011. WATCH:- Unseen footage takes us into the lives of Syrian rebels. The Syrian war is creating profound effects far beyond the country\\'s borders. Lebanon, Turkey, and Jordan are now housing large and growing numbers of Syrian refugees, many of whom have attempted to journey onwards to Europe in search of better conditions. Fighting has occasionally spilled over from Syria into Lebanon, contributing to the country\\'s political polarisation. Several rounds of peace talks have failed to stop the fighting.- But with much of the country in ruins , millions of Syrians having fled abroad, and a population deeply traumatised by war, one thing is certain: Rebuilding Syria after the war ends will be a lengthy, extremely difficult process.

       " ['Brexit uncertainty? It\\'s the luck of the Irish nan When Eoghan Murphy entered the Irish parliament in 2011, he started writing memos to Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny stressing the importance of a strong relationship with China. His views were heard, and soon there was a surge in bilateral trade and investments from financial firms like the leasing arms of ICBC, China Development Bank and Bank of Communications. Huge investments from firms such as Bank of China Aviation and ICBC Leasing made inroads into Dublin. \"From a personal point of view, I\\'ve seen our relationship very much a target of engagement in the past six years,\" Murphy says with a confident and satisfied smile, sitting in his spacious office at the heart of Dublin\\'s Department of Finance.   - Eoghan Murphy, Ireland\\'s minister of state for financial services, believes Ireland could become the new gateway into the European market for Chinese companies after Brexit. Cecily Liu / China Daily  Since becoming Ireland\\'s Minister of State for Financial Services in May 2016, Murphy has aggressively pushed forward the China agenda. With his help, Dublin received a quota for China onshore-financial investment, lodged an application to join the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and made highly publicized visits to Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. Perhaps the timing of his ministerial appointment is fortunate: The Brexit referendum made Murphy realize Ireland could become the new gateway into the European market for Chinese firms, and lost no time in promoting this message. \"With so much uncertainty in the world at the moment, we see ourselves as a rock of certainty and stability,\" says Murphy. Citing Chinese President Xi Jinping\\'s recent speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on the benefits of globalization and free trade, Murphy stresses that Ireland\\'s openness to foreign investment fits exactly into those values. \"We have a pro-business government, we want companies to come in and make investments to create jobs.\"    Those words bear great similarities to the \\'open for business\\' message that Britain\\'s former prime minister David Cameron and former chancellor George Osborne used to strengthen Chinese ties during their time in government. But with Cameron and Osborne having left office after the 2016 referendum vote, hints of the new British government, led by Theresa May, somewhat reducing its level of openness emerged when May announced new legal guidelines to closely scrutinize foreign investment in national security-related infrastructure. Within this context, perhaps Murphy\\'s message chimes more pleasantly with China. For Murphy, strengthening Chinese relations is not empty rhetoric, as Brexit uncertainties have sent a warning to Ireland about overreliance on the UK as a trade partner, and Murphy sees China as an assuring partner in its work to diversify and balance trade. \"We\\'ve had a close relationship with the UK. Slowly over time we\\'ve exported to new markets and found new opportunities, and this process is happening more quickly because of Brexit.\" For instance, the sudden devaluation of the pound was a \"dramatic\" consequence of Brexit-related uncertainties already felt by Irish exporters. \"President Xi spoke about commitment to globalization and countries working together to improve the benefits of globalization for their citizens. I suppose this leads to greater ambition for Chinese firms overseas, and that increases opportunities for a country such as Ireland, which has a global outlook.\" He stresses Ireland\\'s unique advantage as the only English-speaking country in the European Union post-Brexit, its common-law legal system\\'s similarity to the UK\\'s legal framework, and its government\\'s open-for-business attitude, all of which are factors making Dublin attractive for Chinese firms who once went big on UK investment as a means of European expansion, but who are now adopting a wait-and-see attitude while Britain negotiates its exit terms. In addition to attracting Chinese investment into Dublin, Murphy also holds a vision for Dublin to engage with China through the Belt and Road Initiative, financial technology cooperation and educational exchange. The Belt and Road Initiative, initiated by President Xi Jinping three years ago to strengthen Asian European trade links through infrastructure investment, has gained momentum, receiving support from more than 100 countries and international organizations, more than 40 of which have signed cooperation agreements with China. In May, Murphy will visit Beijing for the China-led Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, where he will explore possibilities for Ireland\\'s further participation. In addition, Murphy is eagerly waiting for the AIIB\\'s approval for Ireland\\'s membership, which would enable Ireland help fund infrastructure projects in Belt and Road countries and share its own infrastructure development lessons with the AIIB. \"I think the AIIB plays an important role for countries that need infrastructure investment to increase the capacity and scope of their economies, we want to bring our knowledge to use in the AIIB whenever we can.\" He stresses that Ireland\\'s engagement with AIIB is not entirely centered on self interest, and that the potential financial gains are less important than the geopolitical gains. \"There may not be returns for the Irish state in terms of financial returns, but there\\'ll certainly be a return for helping other economies to increase their scope and improve the standards of living for their people\". Murphy praises the AIIB\\'s operating model, explaining it achieves efficiency, quick delivery speeds while maintaining low operating costs. Murphy says the infrastructure funding AIIB helps to channel into developing countries is crucial at a time when the global economy is searching for new sources of growth. He says: \"It\\'s going to be a whole new source of funding in parts of the world that may not necessarily have the resources. The AIIB has come along at an important time to make sure that type of funding can continue and that model can continue.\" As a country that has also developed on the back of heavy infrastructure development, Ireland has experience to share with the AIIB, such as lessons in public-private partnership investment, Murphy says. Public-private partnerships, in which initial government investment helps to reduce the risk of the private sector\\'s investment, attract a great deal of private-sector investment and are also at the core of AIIB\\'s philosophy. In addition, Murphy sees great opportunities in broader Irish-Chinese fintech collaboration, explaining that Ireland\\'s system of fintech innovation and supply chain could be the fertile soil where Chinese fintech firms strengthen their products and solutions. Education is an additional area in which Murphy hopes to further Irish-Chinese collaboration, not least because he personally developed an interest in China through teaching Chinese students English during his university days. In the early 2000s, Murphy taught English as a foreign language to Chinese and other Asian immigrants to Ireland at the Able Academy in Dublin and developed valuable friendships with his Chinese students, whom he describes as \"especially committed to family, culture and creativity\". \"It was very much interaction outside the classroom that allowed me to understand the Chinese people. They\\'d always invite me to cultural festivals - films, dance, music. On occasion, we\\'d all go out as a group and have food and drink and spend time together, and that\\'s how I got a sense of the importance of family in Chinese culture.\" Those fond memories and precious friendships prompted Murphy to take up Mandarin lessons when he attended King\\'s College London studying for his master\\'s degree, although he admits to finding it difficult. \"I quickly failed at Mandarin. It was very difficult for me. There\\'s the language, the writing, the tonal aspects. I was trying to continue my relationship with China through language, but wasn\\'t able to keep it up.\" Despite not learning Mandarin, Murphy has today found not just one but many ways to continue his relationship with China, including encouraging educational exchanges between Irish and Chinese universities. He says: \"From my visits to the country, I have realized China places a strong emphasis on education. We do as well. We are constantly trying to think of different courses that suit people, help them up-skill, and that\\'s the approach China is taking.\" cecily.liu@mail.chinadailyuk.com (China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page32)'],\n",
       " ['CSIC fueling major marine technology nan Firm developing submersible and maritime nuclear power plant to plumb the depths China has begun to upgrade the design of its first-ever floating nuclear demonstration platform and has nearly finished building a new manned submersible capable of reaching the majority of seabeds in the world, says China Shipbuilding Industry Corp, the primary contractor for the country\\'s navy. A floating nuclear platform is a maritime nuclear power station. The technology can be installed in vessels and provide a stable source of electricity to oil rigs or remote areas such as the South China Sea. It can also provide power to offshore engineering ships, desalination ships or projects. \"This technology can be applied in the development of nuclear-powered icebreakers, nuclear-powered research ships for the polar region and other high-power marine engineering projects in the long-term,\" says Wang Junli, a senior specialist at CSIC\\'s technology and information department. The construction of China\\'s first maritime nuclear power plant is scheduled to be completed by 2018, and it is due to be operational by 2019, according to information released last year by China National Nuclear Corp, CSIC\\'s partner in this project. Eager to enhance its earning ability, China National Nuclear Corp also signed a cooperation agreement with state-owned China State Shipbuilding Corp, a domestic rival of CSIC, to develop similar equipment last week. In another key project, Shao Kaiwen, deputy general manager of CSIC, says developing deep-sea manned submersibles for rough seas will be one of the group\\'s priorities in 2017, with the assembly work and shakedown tests for the vessel due to be completed by the end of this year.

New targets in cutting excess capacity in major sectors such as steel and coal have been set this year, as unveiled at the annual sessions of provincial legislatures in January, they add. The local sessions, which review and approve government economic and social development blueprints, come ahead of the annual sessions of the national legislature and the top political advisory body in March.   - An employee works with steel at a mill of CITIC Heavy Industries in Luoyang, Henan province. Huang Zhengwei / For China Daily  After a reduction of 33 million tons in steel capacity last year, China\\'s northern Hebei province aims to further slash about 32 million tons in the current year, according to the provincial government work report earlier this month. \"2017 will be our toughest year in capacity reduction,\" says Governor Zhang Qingwei. \"No matter how difficult it is, we are determined to succeed,\" Zhang adds. Hebei produces a quarter of the country\\'s iron and steel. Yu Yong, chairman of Hesteel Group, the biggest steel company in Hebei, says properly cutting capacity will make room for restructuring and upgrading of the steel sector.    The company cut 3.2 million tons of iron and steel capacity last year and is targeting a reduction of 4.4 million tons in 2017, Yu adds. Coal-rich Shanxi and central Henan both set the targets of cutting 20 million tons of coal capacity this year. The two provinces each slashed 23 million last year. \"Coal overcapacity reduction should be achieved through market means,\" says Lou Yangsheng, governor of Shanxi, adding that mergers and reorganizations will be encouraged. Hubei says that it will close all its coal production firms in two years. Southwestern Guizhou province will slash 15 million tons of coal capacity by closing 120 coal mines this year. As part of the reform, local governments will also focus on handling poor-performing zombie companies. Eastern Zhejiang province plans to close 300 zombie companies and 1,000 firms with outdated capacity this year. Southern Guangdong province aims to close 74 private zombie firms after it closed more than 2,000 state-owned zombie companies and 39 private companies in 2016. China achieved its 2016 target of cutting 45 million tons of steel and 250 million tons of coal production capacity, affecting nearly 800,000 workers.    This year, the tasks will be heavier, and zombie companies will be focused on, according to Xu Shaoshi, head of the National Development and Reform Commission, the country\\'s top economic planner. So far, 27 provinces have unveiled growth rates for last year and their targets for 2017 at local annual legislative sessions. Among them, 23 had growth rates higher than the national 6.7 percent, with Guizhou, Chongqing and Tibet all above 10 percent. Beijing and Shanghai both reported 6.7 percent. Most of the provinces aim to maintain the same or slightly lower growth than in 2016. With an estimated growth of 4.5 percent in 2016, lower than most other provinces, Shanxi set its GDP growth target at 5.5 percent this year to leave flexibility for transformation and reform. Other reforms, such as market-oriented debt-for-equity swaps and administrative streamlining, are being emphasized by many provinces to reduce corporate leverage and encourage businesses. Besides structural reform in industry, officials says China will also emphasize reform in agriculture this year.  (China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page29)'],\n",

The scheme is a result of negotiations among coal, steel and power industrial associations. It is a sound system that caters to the interests of producers and consumers in the market,\" says Jiang Zhimin, president of the China National Coal Association. Last week, the National Development and Reform Commission released a notice on preventing severe coal price fluctuations in 2017, establishing specific benchmark prices for the mid-and long-term contracts between coal companies, power companies and steel smelters. The commission has formulated three price spectrums: green (500-570 yuan per ton, or $73-83 per ton; 49-56 euros; 43-49), blue (570-600 or 470-500 yuan per ton) and red (above 600 or below 470 yuan per ton). In the green region, there will be no adjustment measures. In the blue region, the government will enhance market supervision and offer guiding measures when deemed appropriate. In the red region, the government will launch the contingency plan for the adjustment of abnormal prices. \"Generally speaking, coal prices of 500 to 700 yuan per ton are acceptable for most coal companies and downstream industries. Below 470 yuan per ton, the coal industry will suffer across-the-board losses,\" says Jiang. The power coal price was around 639 yuan per ton at the end of last year, up 72.7 percent from the beginning of 2016. Jiang does not offer any prediction about the capacity reduction goal this year, saying that it\\'s being discussed and will be released by the State Council after the Spring Festival holiday. The actual capacity reduction last year was around 300 million tons, compared with the goal of 250 million tons. The capacity is increasingly concentrating in large companies.

Lyu Jia / For China Daily  He suggested the government should boost investments in metros and urban underground utilities and take measures to fight against air pollution. China could also encourage companies to increase their environmentally-friendly investments by upgrading equipment to meet higher emissions standards. It is important for the central government to continue streamlining its administration, delegating power to lower levels and reducing bias against privately owned enterprises in regard to market entry. This will help stabilize the economy in the short term and optimize China\\'s economic structure in the medium and long run, he said. Zhao Yang, economist at Nomura International (Hong Kong) Limited, agreed with Qu, saying that he expects the government to launch a more active fiscal policy to accelerate infrastructure investments related to environmental protection, urban transportation, underground pipeline networks and high-speed rails. Liu Ligang, chief China economist at Citigroup Inc, said Citi forecasts that the Chinese economy will grow by 6.5 percent in 2017, if infrastructure investments maintain a growth rate of about 20 percent, and if the growth of consumption and foreign trade remain the same as last year. \"We believe China\\'s policy priority will be economic stability over structural reform in 2017. Leading into late 2017, a \\'steady boat\\' measure in economic policy is likely to be adopted to minimize economic uncertainty. This means the 2016 policy framework could be strengthened this year, with fiscal policy leading the way to achieve a 6.5 to 7 percent growth target,\" Liu says. State-owned enterprise reform saw modest progress in the second half of 2016. Looking ahead, he says the ongoing corporatization of SOEs will continue. However, as a result of the \"steady boat\" approach to economic policy this year, SOE ownership reform - the more decisive part of the reform - may have to wait until 2018. Externally, US President Donald Trump\\'s policies may mean more trade frictions between China and the US, but Liu and other Citigroup economists believe the political and economic stakes are simply too high for the largest and second-largest economies of the world to engage in a trade war. \"Trump\\'s threats on China\\'s currency and trade could mean Beijing will need to sit down and negotiate seriously with the US on market access and protecting intellectual property rights. In some areas, if interests are aligned, these dynamics could also help accelerate China\\'s reform process,\" he says. jiangxueqing@chinadaily.com.cn   - Maintenance technicians conduct checks on the maglev train before it enters trial operations in Changsha, Hunan province.

From 2012 to 2014, consumption contributed around 50 percent to GDP growth, and the rising ratio has indicated a solid growth in consumer spending and improvement in industrial structures, analysts say. \"The consumption sector has been a strong area of the Chinese economy, which has been dragged down by slowing exports and investments,\" says Zhao Ping, deputy director of the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, under the Ministry of Commerce.

Official data released by the bureau showed that in 2016, fixed-asset investment increased by 8.1 percent year-on-year, down by 0.2 percentage points compared with the first 11 months. The decline is in line with the slowing pace of the government's approval for infrastructure construction projects. The National Development and Reform Commission, the nation's economic regulator, approved 227 fixed-asset investment projects valued 1.7 trillion yuan ($247 billion; 229.7 billion euros; 198.1 billion) in 2016. In 2015, the commission approved a total of 280 fixed-asset investment projects, valued 2.52 trillion yuan. Although the year-on-year growth rate of fixed-asset investment slowed down to the lowest level since 1999, a closer look at the data breakdown points to some promising signs. Investments made by private companies grew by 3.2 percent in 2016 year-on-year, 0.1 percentage points higher than the first 11 months, and the fourth consecutive month to see improvement. An improvement on the private side indicated some improvement in confidence about the future outlook of the economy, according to Niu Li, an economist at the State Information Center. Private investment accounts for about 60 percent of total fixed-asset investment, according to the NBS. Ren Zeping, chief economist of Founder Securities, says the improvement in the private sector was driven up by a warming up in the manufacturing industry and higher-than-expected property investment. Investment in the manufacturing industry rose 4.2 percent year-on-year in 2016, up by 0.6 percentage points compared to the first 11 months in 2016, the data showed.

There have been signs that the Chinese regulator wants to accelerate the approval of initial public offerings this year as pressure in the IPO pipeline has been mounting, with more than 700 companies queueing to issue new shares. In the past two weeks alone, the regulator has approved 24 IPOs, more than doubling the number of deals of the same period in 2016. \"This is a signal that the regulator is speeding up the approval of IPOs, which could weigh on the current market price,\" says Li Yuebo, an analyst with Industrial Securities Co Ltd.

The State-run Xinhua News Agency last week quoted experts as saying that China\\'s \"normalization\" of IPOs could help raise the financing efficiency of companies and direct more capital into the real economy.

       " ['Racing ahead with the motoring elite nan Luxury sports carmaker McLaren is confident of making inroads into Chinese market, says its chief Luxury sports car brand McLaren has come a long way from selling its first car in China four years ago to now generating a major chunk of its global sales from the country. It is profiting from keen interest shown by China\\'s rapidly-growing community of wealthy consumers. The British super sports brand experienced a stellar year in 2016 with a 99.3 percent increase in global sales to 3,286 cars. In China alone, McLaren sold 228 cars last year, a significant addition to the total of 300 it sold in its first three years in China.   - Mike Flewitt, chief executive officer of McLaren Automotive, feels confident about the company\\'s future in China. Provided to China Daily  It\\'s an achievement that is a little hard to believe given McLaren\\'s China office, in Shanghai, employs only 10 staff, who are mainly in charge of the sales, marketing, after-sales services and relationship management. The company works with a network of 14 Chinese retailers to distribute its cars. \"Affluent Chinese supercar customers appreciate the attributes of the McLaren car and our cars are well suited to this developing market,\" says Mike Flewitt, chief executive officer of McLaren Automotive. \"As a result, we are very confident about our prospects going forward.\" Recently, Flewitt spoke with China Daily about the luxury car maker\\'s strategy and business opportunities in China. The following are edited excerpts from the interview:    How would you describe your company\\'s prospects in China, given the current economic situation? At McLaren Automotive, we feel very confident about our future in China. We are a relatively new company and we sold our first car in China in September 2013, so went later into the market than most of our competitors. We have seen sales of a number of competitors decline. In contrast to that, in 2015, our sales grew by 56 percent compared with 2014. Awareness of the McLaren brand is developing well through a number of marketing activities, including motor shows and retailer activity. As a result, we are very confident about our prospects going forward. What has been your company\\'s biggest achievement in the mainland market? In my view, setting up a good retailer network in any market, especially a growing market like China, is vital to the success of any company and is one of our greatest achievements. We have worked hard in a very short period of time to find quality retail partners who can represent the McLaren brand well. We have 14 retailers across China and these retailers are growing sales dramatically. As a relatively new competitor in the marketplace, these retailers will be key in developing the awareness and consideration of McLaren in this rapidly developing marketplace and so their achievements will reflect our achievements. In your view, what is the secret of your business\\'s success in China? Very simply, understanding the needs, desires and expectations of our customers. Only in this way can we deliver products that meet those expectations. I and all of my executives frequently meet our customers face-to-face at company-organized events, as well as social gatherings, to listen and understand exactly what they think about us and want from us. What is an example of McLaren\\'s customer-centric approach in China? An example of this was attending the Beijing Autoshow. It was only the second time we had displayed cars in Beijing. We had an excellent presence at the show and we invited our retailers and customers to our stand to debut the new McLaren 570GT to Asian customers. While we were in Beijing, we also took the time to have a gala dinner with our affluent customers, to show them how grateful we were for their patronage but also to help us understand how we can improve what we do for them. We try and have these dinners and social gatherings wherever we are in the world, but it\\'s especially important in China because the landscape and culture changes so quickly. These meetings also help them understand more about who McLaren is, so it\\'s a mutually beneficial outcome. What essential leadership qualities do you consider important when leading your team to grow in the Chinese market? We have recruited very successful leaders in China. A very clear understanding of the local market requirements is vital, as well as the cultural sensitivities and differences between China and other parts of the world. In addition, as in other parts of the world, it\\'s key to understand how the affluent classes behave, spend their free time and so on. Only in this way can we hope to be talking to them in a way that they understand and appreciate, and build strong, long-term and trusting relationships with customers. How does your China market strategy fit in with your work in the Asia-Pacific region? China is part of our Asia-Pacific region and we have populated the leadership roles within that regional team with international people who understand the markets through experience with competitor brands, as well as Chinese employees who understand what Chinese buyers think and want. This balance of international experience and local knowledge has served us very well and has helped deliver the significant sales growth we are experiencing. How do you motivate your international team? Different people need different motivation. We are still a relatively new and small company so I know most of our employees personally. Whenever I travel abroad to events or meetings, if possible, I try to have a meeting or dinner with the local teams to get understanding and feedback from them on performance and how we can make their lives easier. In this way, everybody can feel that their ideas are being listened to and each and every one of them is inputting into the future of the company. In addition, we are fortunate to have a very motivational and passionate brand to work for, and the cars that we build are some of the most aspirational products in the world. All of our employees feel a tremendous sense of pride and motivation to be working for a globally recognized brand like McLaren. This combination makes working for McLaren a very motivational and enjoyable experience. What do you think about the Chinese Dream? What are the dreams you have for your company in China? As a young company, I have many dreams and aspirations that I would like our company to fulfill. Mainly, I would like us to ensure that our potential in this very dynamic and growing market is exceeded. We have started well and made some significant developments in a short period of time. What are McLaren\\'s long-term sales goals in China and globally? Globally, and in China, we have to remain focused on our objectives if our longer-term sales ambitions are going to be achieved. I am very confident that we build the best sports cars in the world but our brand has varying levels of awareness across the globe. In some markets, we have high levels of awareness thanks to an understanding created by our long-term participation in Formula One. But in markets where awareness of Formula One and wider motorsport is low, as a young company we have to develop that awareness. I\\'ve said this before but it\\'s a vital ingredient of our future success. Customer awareness of McLaren building the world\\'s best sports cars is how we will fulfill our potential. What are your hobbies? How do you spend your time outside of work when you are in China? As CEO of a young and dynamic company, I don\\'t have a huge amount of spare time. I try and get as close to as many of our customers as possible and this often entails traveling to, or attending events with, McLaren customers over the evenings and weekends. When I\\'m travelling in China, I\\'m keen to understand how we can improve what we do for them. When I am at home in the UK and have time, I am an avid motor racing fan, as you might expect doing the job I do and for a company like McLaren, and so I enjoy racing my own historic racing cars whenever I can. cecily@mail.chinadailyuk.com (China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page31)'],\n",
       " ['Chinese law firm Yingke goes beyond routine legal help nan Dealing with legal complexities in the UK requires advice on the local culture, says company Leading Chinese law firm Yingke is following Chinese companies\\' rapid expansion into the United Kingdoms and European markets, providing them with legal guidance and as well as local market advice. \"We go beyond our normal work of just advising clients on law. We advise them also on culture and ways of thinking in the market they are expanding into, so our role is more encompassing than, strictly speaking, the lawyer\\'s role,\" says Linda Yang, global partner and executive chairman of Yingke\\'s global board of directors. \"This is rewarding because we are able to participate in our clients\\' international expansion journey,\" she says.   Yingke international partners celebrate the 15th anniversary in 2016 in Beijing. The Chinese law firm is optimistic about doing more deals in the UK, which has become a popular destination for Chinese investors. Provided to China Daily  Yingke originally established a UK subsidiary in 2010, but its presence has significantly grown since it established an exclusive strategic partnership with London-based, mid-market corporate firm Memery Crystal in 2015. Its UK subsidiary, Yingke UK Consulting, is not a direct subsidiary of Yingke Law because Chinese law firms aren\\'t allowed to be shareholders of foreign entities, although the UK entity is directly controlled by the managing partner of Yingke Law. The two law firms have so far collaborated on half a dozen deals, ranging from property investment to cross border acquisitions in fields including football, software technology and industrial technology, although details of the deals are kept confidential. Most of those deals represent Chinese outbound investments originating from Yingke\\'s clients in China. The deals signed in the UK follow UK local law, with Memery Crystal playing a crucial part in seeing the deals through on the ground, as well as occasionally proposing local market acquisition targets if their existing UK clients are looking for investors.  Yang is optimistic about doing more deals in the UK, as her team has witnessed more interest from Chinese firms in acquiring UK targets after the June referendum vote when the UK voted to leave the European Union, leading to a depreciation of the pound. In recent years, the UK has become a popular destination for Chinese investors. According to a new study, released in November 2016 by Cass Business School, there were 91 Chinese cross-border M&A investments in the UK from January 2012 to June 2016. Popular sectors of these M&A activities include football, property, healthcare and high technology, says Yang. \"These deals allow Chinese investors to gain technology and expertise very fast, and allow them to quickly internationalize.\" Founded in Beijing in 2001, Yingke has quickly grown to become one of China\\'s most famous law firms. According to a league table released in September by The American Lawyer magazine, Yingke is China\\'s largest law firm by headcount and ranked sixth in China by 2015 revenue. Its 2015 revenue also represented a 38 percent year-on-year increase, according to The American Lawyer. Yingke signed a new partnership agreement with the UN Development Program in November focusing on South-South cooperation. The agreement made Yingke one of the five founders of the Global Coalition of Think Tank Networks for South-South Cooperation, focusing on risk management and research in law, regulations and policies. Yang says Yingke was selected by the UNDP mainly because of its global network. Yang says Yingke maintains an open corporate culture, meaning partners can \"express their own opinions and carry out services in ways they would prefer\".  Another unique characteristic of Yingke is the array of opportunities it offers young lawyers, as some of the firm\\'s young partners are only in their 30s. Yang says this youthful culture keeps the company vibrant. As an established firm in China, Yingke began its international expansion in 2010, championing a model of forming partnerships with law firms in each of the international jurisdictions it practices in. It refers its existing clients hoping to expand overseas to its partner firms abroad and, once a deal is done, revenue from the legal advice is shared between Yingke and its overseas partner. \"We think this way of expansion is more effective than sending our own teams of lawyers abroad because our partners\\' mature teams allow us to expand quicker globally as a law firm and also because law is such a regulated profession, lawyers need to understand local laws and regulations. We believe this type of partnership creates the best value for our clients,\" she says. Yang says Yingke\\'s grasp on cultural understanding is a big advantage in helping clients secure cross-border deals. \"Cultural differences can be a big setback for major international deals, but it only takes a little bit of effort to explain things to our clients and make sure they understand.\" She recalls one incident, when a Yingke client was setting up a joint venture with a Western partner. The Chinese CEO wanted to show his team\\'s interest and commitment so he made a casual remark as a gesture of friendship that the Chinese side will be the majority partner, but the Western firm insisted for this point to appear in the contract. The Chinese firm refused to include this point in a contract, believing it was only an unofficial friendly remark, so the deal was in jeopardy for a long time - that is, until Yingke stepped in to explain the cultural misunderstanding, that the Chinese firm made the comment only as a message of commitment, not in a legal sense. Examples of such cultural misunderstandings are plenty in Yang\\'s team\\'s daily work, she explains. For instance, Chinese people do not like saying no, so they often just say \\'sure\\' while listening to a point their Western partner makes, but this does not necessarily mean they agree. \"So it\\'s important to really understand what the Chinese company means when they say \\'sure\\'.\" On a more serious note, Yang says Yingke firmly believes Chinese companies should seek legal advice throughout the global expansion process, instead of relying on legal advice from their joint venture partners in an international market. She recalls a client who once expanded into Portugal initially without a legal advisor, and did not understand that all legally-binding decisions from board meetings in Portugal must be written in English and Portuguese. Its unreliable Portuguese joint venture partner took advantage of local law by translating all decisions favorable for the Portuguese side into Portuguese, leaving the decisions favorable for the Chinese side in English. The Chinese investor suffered a lot from these legal disadvantages, and in the end their Portuguese JV went bankrupt. Championing local market understanding with an extensive legal background, Yingke now has a global network covering more than 30 countries, including the UK, Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Spain, Italy, Greece and Israel. In the UK, Yingke chose to partner with Memery Crystal due to similar corporate cultures. \"They are international-minded and inclusive, and keen to take on new challenges.\" Speaking about this open-minded attitude, Yang remembers when two partners from Memery Crystal visited Shanghai and asked her to take them to a local restaurant to try a famous Shanghai dish called \\'hairy crab\\' they had heard about. \"We were impressed by their willingness to try new things, so we took them to a restaurant. They tried to eat hairy crab actually, but it was very difficult to break the shell and eat it and they ended up making a mess. But we were impressed by their ability to try, as we know a lot of Westerners would just not bother at all.\" Memery Crystal CEO Nick Davis also speaks fondly about the Yingke partnership. \"Our two companies have a shared focus on serving clients and our teams share a similar outlook. Memery Crystal is a company which has a history of serving private entrepreneurs, so our corporate culture is very similar to Yingke\\'s,\" Davis says. cecily.liu@mail.chinadailyuk.com ( China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page30)'],\n",
       " ['To Russia with energetic love nan Chinese investment in a natural gas project in the resource-rich Arctic region promises to be a game-changer later this year Amega overseas project for liquefied natural gas that will likely burnish China\\'s global profile, contribute to the country\\'s energy security, enhance its geopolitical strategy and bolster efforts for economic rejuvenation is scheduled to start production in the Russian Arctic late this year. The Yamal project - its corporate entity is called Oao Yamal LNG - is located in north-central Russia and is expected to produce 16.5 million metric tons per annum. In September 2013, China National Petroleum Corp, the country\\'s largest oil and gas producer by annual output, acting through its subsidiary, CNPC Russia, bought a 20 percent stake in Oao Novatek\\'s $27-billion (25 billion euros; 21.6 billion) Yamal project for $5.4 billion.    Oao Novatek holds a 50.1 percent stake in the Yamal project, while Total holds 20 percent and the Silk Road Fund, 9.9 percent. Novatek is Russia\\'s independent natural gas producer and the country\\'s second-biggest LNG company after state-owned Gazprom. China\\'s investment will help the Russian gas supplier to complete the project, one of the largest industrial undertakings in the Russian Arctic. The new gas production center evolving in the Yamal Peninsula is expected to transform the Russian gas industry. It is also expected to boost China\\'s oil and gas reserves substantially, ensuring a steady, long-term supply. Much of Yamal\\'s output would be supplied to China and other Asian countries, according to Novatek. CNPC pledged to buy at least 3 million tons of LNG per year, said analysts. According to Wang Lu, an Asia-Pacific oil and gas analyst from Bloomberg Intelligence, imports from Yamal may account for more than 1.6 percent of China\\'s gas demand, which is estimated to be 257 billion cubic meters in 2018, assuming a 10 percent compound annual growth rate during the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20). \"China\\'s LNG imports will continue to be an important contributor to its supply landscape in 2020,\" she says. \"The project\\'s success and reliability will enhance CNPC\\'s investment return, so this aligns CNPC\\'s interests with Novatek\\'s.\" For CNPC, Yamal has strategic importance. It expects the project to foster greater cooperation between Beijing and Moscow in the Arctic, give a fillip to economic development and scientific research, and shape regional rules and norms relating to gas reserves in the region. Li Li, energy research director at ICIS China, a consulting company that provides analysis of China\\'s energy market, says the country had arranged for the steady import of natural gas from Russia even before the Yamal investment. Russia\\'s Gazprom has a 30-year contract with China to supply 38 billion cu m of natural gas annually beginning in 2018. CNPC\\'s participation in Yamal is part of Chinese companies\\' global strategy and signifies the country\\'s intent to be a key player in the crucial Arctic region. In the process, China will have also helped Russia with its shortage due to sanctions imposed by the US and Europe over the annexation of Crimea. The deal represents a significant step in Russian President Vladimir Putin\\'s push to boost commercial ties with China. China\\'s backing will ensure the project will roll, says an official from CNPC Russia. Elaborating, he says sanctions had rendered financing for the project in US dollars impossible. Several US and European banks have pulled out of financing deals, leaving a void to be filled with China\\'s capital, technology and massive markets. According to Evgeniy Kot, director-general of the Yamal project, the company has sold 96 percent of the project\\'s LNG production to European and Asian customers through 20- to 25-year contracts. Benefiting from the vast natural gas reserves across the Yamal Peninsula, the company signed loan agreements with the Export-Import Bank of China and the China Development Bank Corp for 1.2 billion yuan ($173 million; 161 million euros; 138 million ) in all. For its part, Russia will provide tax incentives to companies involved in the development of the Arctic region, including zero export duty on LNG and special tariffs for condensate oil. CNPC Russia said it is confident Novatek\\'s rich experience in operating in Arctic weather conditions will help the Yamal project. zhengxin@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page27)'],\n",
       " ['Measure of change nan Nobel-winning economist Robert Engle suggests improvements to capital allocation for fast-growing SMEs American economist Robert Engle gave Chinese officials some ideas on how to make China\\'s financial sector more efficient. Engle, winner of the 2003 Nobel Prize in economics, along with British economist Clive Granger, was invited to Beijing last week by the State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs to give his suggestions on risk management in China\\'s capital market because of his expertise in studying volatility. Financial institutions should be subjected to regular stress tests to see if they remain solvent enough in the face of an economic downturn. The results of such tests should be published publicly and become benchmarks for the performance of banks so that they do a more effective job of choosing where the loans go, he says.   - Robert Engle, Nobel laureate, makes a speech at an economic forum in Nankai University in Tianjin in October 2016. Photos Provided to China Daily   - Engle and his wife Mary attend the forum at Nankai University, where he is an honorary professor.   \"I think that many more benefits will come from improving allocation of capital to the fast-growing SMEs, which are also job creators,\" says Engle, 75. He and Granger are recognized for developing the groundbreaking statistical model, called the autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity, designed to analyze unpredictable movements in market prices and interest rates. The method can also measure systematic risks in financial markets, especially on a short-term basis. \"If you try to predict a year in the future, it\\'s very complicated. If it\\'s a day in the future, that\\'s not so hard,\" he explains. \"If we talk about risk management for financial applications, maybe short-horizon predictions are enough.\" Engle earned a master\\'s degree in physics before he went on to acquire a PhD in economics from Cornell University in 1969. \"I decided that I wanted to work on something that more than 10 people in the world will understand,\" he says of the reason behind changing streams in academics. While studying economics was at first a \"slow and painful process\", Engle believes his background in physics and statistics eventually helped him stand out as an economist. \"Because in physics we do experiments to measure some complicated things and figure out what they really mean. That\\'s the same way we do economic analysis,\" he says. A longtime professor of economics, Engle now teaches at New York University\\'s Stern School of Business, where he is the Michael Armellino professor of financial services management. Engle paid his first visit to China in 1985, when he was invited to teach an econometrics course at Renmin University of China in Beijing. During the six-week program, which was sponsored by the Ford Foundation and China\\'s Ministry of Education, Engle and two other American teachers taught students from different parts of the country. Chinese students were rather quiet back then, and he did all sorts of things, including giving them small souvenirs, to get them to talk. As part of the trip, Engle toured Shanghai, Guilin and Chengdu and visited many tourist sites in the cities. \"China has changed so dramatically in 30 years. That\\'s extraordinary.\" People in Beijing were still wearing old-style blue outfits in the 1980s, and there were very few cars and everybody was riding a bicycle. It was also hard to find people who spoke English, and he had to get somebody to write down in Chinese the name of his hotel so that he could tell a taxi driver to take him back, Engle says. \"If they (Chinese authorities) can figure out what\\'s the right thing to do, they\\'ll do it. And they\\'ve been very good at that,\" he adds. Engle, who is on an advisory board of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, comes to China more often these days, attending conferences and giving talks. In 2014, Engle launched a Shanghai branch of the Volatility Institute of the Stern School of Business as part of a New York University initiative there. He is director of the institute. NYU Shanghai, which was established by New York University and East China Normal University, is the first Sino-US university campus. Operated in close partnership with the Stern School and applying tools such as an award-winning model to analyze data, the Volatility Institute at NYU Shanghai provides financial information and analysis of the markets on its website for economists, regulators and even the general public. The Shanghai institute has cooperated with the stock exchange and universities in the southern metropolis, and has also started an annual conference series that brings experts to discuss China\\'s financial system, Engle says. Despite his busy schedule as a high-profile economist and a regular teaching schedule, Engle tries to stick to hobbies like figure skating and dancing. But whenever he gets a chance to relax, he finds a lot of questions running through his mind. \"I always look for simple answers,\" says Engle, who rewards himself with simple pleasures like a cup of coffee every time he figures out an answer. liuxiangrui@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page21)'],\n",
       " ['When rooster makes a call nan Apple gets Chinese artists to present traditional themes in a modern way for Spring Festival As Spring Festival approaches each year, Chinese households follow the custom of hanging paintings - usually colored woodblock prints - on their doors and walls to welcome the new year. However, the tradition has changed a little in the digital age. One such painting now appears on gadgets\\' screens, with the swords of door gods replaced by karaoke microphones. One of the door gods holds a camera and a bird\\'s cage, and behind him are skyscrapers and fancy cars.   - Above and bottom: Chinese New Year pictures take on a modern look in the creations by young Chinese artists. Photos Provided to China Daily  The peace-themed Chinese Lunar New Year painting, created by Beijing-based artist Ye Hongxing, was first designed on a computer and then turned into a physical work of art - a mosaic of tens of thousands of stickers. \"I combined modern and traditional elements to make it interesting. They can be downloaded as wallpapers on phones and computers,\" says Ye. She is one of the five artists invited by US tech giant Apple Inc to make paintings focusing on reunion, fortune, peace and harvest - traditional themes of Chinese woodblock prints for Spring Festival paintings that date back hundreds of years. Unlike Ye, whose paintings have both electronic and printed versions, the other four artists\\' works are only online. But pictures by all five artists are shown on screens at subway stops and on skyscrapers, and countless phone screens to celebrate the Year of the Rooster. \"New Year pictures are used to convey people\\'s good wishes for the coming year. They often feature fish to herald good fortune and door gods to signal peace and safety,\" says Ye.    The 45-year-old was born in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region. Her family would hang pictures of door gods and New Year paintings on the walls when she was a child. Apart from those heralding good fortune, some traditional works were created based on stories from Peking Opera, literature and folk legends. \"You can learn about people\\'s lives in different periods of time through these pictures, such as how they dressed or what they ate. The pictures are different in different places in China,\" Ye says. Ye\\'s work contains motifs that make the door gods look modern. The karaoke microphone, camera, bird cage, high buildings, wheels, cars and a flying astronaut all reflect different aspects of our society today, she explains. Parts of the massive image are made up of stickers that are small in size and feature popular symbols like Hello Kitty and Angry Birds. \"It\\'s the first time for me to create a Spring Festival picture in such a modern way. I thought they were only made by craftsmen, who teach apprentices,\" Ye says. Illustrator Eszter Chen also says it\\'s a new way to represent the traditional genre in the digital era and in a style typical of a younger generation. The 28-year-old, Taipei-based illustrator created an electronic version focusing on the important dinner on the eve of the Chinese New Year. In Chen\\'s picture, friends gathered around dining tables have their phones or handheld devices with them. They either send messages bearing good wishes while eating together or have a video chat with those who are away. Even a rooster has a phone in hand - well, in wing. \"It\\'s common to see such kinds of family gatherings. It\\'s interesting,\" says Chen. She recalls that, during her childhood, Spring Festival pictures were printed on calendars, featuring chubby children or various gods. After the family dinner, people set off fireworks and visited relatives. Chen moved to California after primary school. It was impossible to have many relatives at such dinners there. She says the people in her picture are friends and neighbors from a community, who gather to celebrate the occasion in the era of globalization. Dishes on their tables are from different regions of China and include hotpot, seafood, dumplings and tea. \"Times are changing, and technology is changing, too. But New Year pictures will always be our way to celebrate the festival - just through different media,\" says Chen. Xie Wei, a marketing manager from Apple Inc, says that at a time when people are complaining about the disappearing traditions surrounding Spring Festival, technology is helping to revive them in a way that appeals to youth. dengzhangyu@chinadaily.com.cn       (China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page20)'],\n",
       " ['Reunion of the Year nan Editor\\'s note: To understand China, sit down to eat. Food is the indestructible bond that holds the whole social fabric together and it is also one of the last strong bonds of community and culture. You\\'ve probably read all about it in the news - the annual exodus of migrant workers from the cities. For the past week, millions of Chinese have risked smog, snow and fog to hurry home for dinner. The migrant masses would have planned for months and booked their tickets way in advance for this crucial trip. Today is the eve of the lunar new year, a day which will start off the Spring Festival holidays. The meal we\\'re talking about is the all-important reunion banquet, the last dinner of the year for the whole family - tuanyuanfan. It is a time-tested tradition for the extended family to gather for this dinner, no matter how far away they\\'ve gone from home during the year.     - Clockwise from top: It is a happy occasion with the extended family at the all-important reunion banquet of the year. Jiaozi is a must on the occasion, which symbolizes the changeover from old to new. Mahjong is the icing on the cake. Chuai Chatu / For China Daily   For many in China, this is also the only holiday they get to spend with their family, when they can relax for a few days and catch up with friends, eat, drink, play and sleep late before they go back to the grind. It is a happy occasion, a loud raucous celebration with lots of card games, mahjong and merry-making. But most important of all, it is a time for all Chinese to reconnect with their cultural and culinary roots. It is a time to pay respects to the parents by acknowledging and honoring the effort they had invested in the family. It is a time to bond with siblings and cousins, aunts and uncles. It is also a time to feast. The reunion dinner table will be overflowing with the most delicious tastes of home, all appropriately named to usher in peace, prosperity, happiness and good luck for the new year. In the frozen north, a feast of fish is the best way to celebrate. Fish is yu, homophonic with great abundance, and an ingredient that is treasured for its rarity. Huge half-meter monsters are fished from the frozen lakes and rivers in massive operations that involve the whole community. The fish will be seared, then braised in iron pans with sloping sides on which grain pancakes will bake, later to be eaten with both fish and pan juices. Still north of the Yangtze, wheat is the staple and noodles and dumplings appear with monotonous regularity at every festive occasion. For the Spring Festival, dumplings are part of the menu of comfort foods. Jiaozi sounds like the words for transition, symbolizing the changeover from old to new. In many places, the home chefs will place little surprises in the dumplings - a red Chinese date, a little silver coin, a cooked chestnut. The fortunate bachelor who gets the red date in his dumpling will have a sweetheart in the new year, while the chestnut will bring a new baby to the family. The silver coin signifies good luck and prosperity and is probably the most coveted prize. For symbolic dishes served at the reunion dinner, no one does it better than the Cantonese. Every dish on the table is carefully named so the entire menu reflects an abundance of blessings. There will always be a whole fish, niannian youyu, for abundance every year. This dish is usually saved so it can be served again on the first day of the new year, so the riches of the past year will continue to be enjoyed. An entire pig trotter braised with black moss and mushrooms may be the next attraction, facai zhushou. This dish represents wealth and prosperity. Another popular dish is fried diced seafood and vegetables wrapped in beancurd skin and steamed. These little \"money bags\" are called jinyin mantang, or halls filled with gold and silver. Dried oysters, known as hou-see in Cantonese, are often cooked with mushrooms so the businessmen in the family will find a good marketplace for their products and services. The list goes on.    It is normally during dinner that the young, unmarried members of the family will get their yasuiqian, red packets of money that will help them enter the new year happily and safely. The festivities will slowly peak after dinner. Once the dishes are cleared and washed, the dough boards will be brought out. In the north, the whole family will start kneading dough and rolling out dumpling skins. Trays of dumplings will be set out, ready for the next day. Traditionally, there will be minimal cooking on the first day of the Spring Festival, a time devoted to welcoming close relatives and friends to the house. As the family gather to make dumplings, the television will be tuned in to the annual variety show put out by national broadcasters, China Central Television. It is entertainment designed to please the whole family, with songs, dances, skits, magic acts and the beloved acrobatic and martial arts displays. If there is an elderly person in the household, the family will be careful to keep bright lights burning as a prayer for longevity. At 11 pm, the start of the hour of the Rat, the New Year officially begins and the young ones will gather in gardens and backyards to light firecrackers and fireworks. For the next 15 days, the normal ban on fireworks will be lifted in all major Chinese cities and there will be firecrackers all day and fireworks displays each night. The card games, mahjong sessions, eating and drinking will go on almost all night, at least until the Golden Rooster crows and ushers in a brand new lunar year. Here\\'s wishing one and all a peaceful and prosperous New Year and a very happy Spring Festival. paulined@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page19)'],\n",
       " ['Holiday sales are a sign of the ancient times nan Chinese characters for buying and selling have their roots in history It\\'s the holiday season again, and the celebration of the Lunar New Year can mean family gathering and rampant consumerism. In urban China, people learn Christmas carols primarily in shopping malls and celebrate the New Year by taking advantage of holiday discounts on Taobao. In keeping with this modern-day ritual, our character this time is ä¹?(mÇ\\x8ei, purchase, buy). The traditional version for ä¹?is è²? on which you can still find traces of its pictographic past. On top of the character is the ç½?(wÇ\\x8eng, net) radical, and on the bottom, the è´?(b¨¦i, cowry shells) radical. As cowry shells were used as an early form of currency in China and many parts of the world, together, they form the image of goods exchanged with currency and put into a net.    By the same logic, the character for \"sell\" is a slight variation of \"buy\" - adding an \"out\" radical on top of the character, indicating the reverse flow of goods from the net. Originally created based on the image of grass growing out of the earth, the \"out\" radical evolved into the \"å\\x8d? radical. Put this simplified radical on top of ä¹? you get å\\x8d?(mÃ\\xa0i) or \"\"sell\"\". Naturally'],\n",
       " ['The (r) evolution of an internet celebrity nan A young woman from China\\'s hinterland, with few qualities believed necessary for success, claws her way to online respectability by following loads of chutzpah with growing sophistication. During the latest US presidential election, most Chinese pundits followed the prognostication of mainstream American media and wrote off Donald Trump as an outlier with more entertainment value than a real chance of winning. A notable exception was Luo Yufeng, who did not belong to any think tank here in China or Stateside. A month before the November election, she said, based on the Twitter accounts of Trump and Clinton that she followed, she sensed more support for Trump. On the day of the election, she posted an article about a trailer driver she knew, which ended up explaining Trump\\'s unexpected victory better than almost all Chinese-language analysis that surfaced in the immediate aftermath of the event.    The driver, who Luo claims to have known for several years, used to make a decent living by hauling big loads across the American continent. He could rake in considerable cash during the holiday seasons like Christmas because he was willing to work while others would take the time off for family gatherings. But, with the inflow of new immigrants, his pay flattened out and then started a long decline. Now he had to consider quitting the business. He legally migrated to the United States a decade ago, and his livelihood, unlike that of most middle-class American families, was threatened by the wave of illegal immigrants under a Democratic administration. Luo\\'s article did not draw any conclusions. She just gave a vivid description of one person and his quandary. Luo works in a New York beauty parlor, earning a living by clipping nails for customers. She is the furthest thing from a talking head in an ivory tower or power center. She is plugged in to the grassroots, at least the social segment that is her crowd in terms of linguistic preference and social background. Back home in China, her writing has gained a sizable following.    A following that used to mock her for her plain looks and ungainly behavior. In the past year and half, many of her early detractors have publicly apologized for their ugly words of prejudice against her. Each of her articles is followed by an endless string of apologies such as this on the iFeng site: \"Sister Phoenix, I was one of those who had ruthlessly ridiculed you. I didn\\'t know it was a complex thing to evaluate someone. I just took the surface for what it is. I have since discovered your talent and your insight and your perseverance. \"I have read all your writings. And I can say that many of those empty-talking experts are just out there for self-gain. Only you have articulated the hardships of people at the bottom of society like us. My sincerest apology to you.\" Sister Phoenix, or Fengjie, is her online moniker, patterned on a character in a literary classic. For several years it was a name people loved to hate, or at least to laugh at. A profile in People magazine called her \"China\\'s most hated reality star\". Indeed, there was reason enough to take her as a joke as she was positioning herself as more or less a clown for the purpose of public attention. Luo, born in 1985, hailed from a poor village in the hinterland. She attended college for three years and worked as an elementary school teacher for two years. Then she decided to head for the bright lights. Moving to Shanghai, she found that competition was more fierce in the big city. She was working at the checkout counter of a supermarket when she began to use the dating game as her platform for self-promotion. She turned herself into an instant laughing stock when she listed her ideal men, who included a couple of Chinese superstars and the US president.    Her outrageous remarks, such as her self-assessment as \"one with the highest IQ in 300 years and 300 more years from now\", kept her in the limelight, winning her the title \"worthy of the Nobel prize in chutzpah\". Coupled with her lack of physical beauty as defined by stars, her brazenness stood out glaringly in a culture that traditionally values modesty and self-effacement. Luo did the rounds of the nation\\'s reality shows, but rarely made it to the finals. Just as her 15 minutes of fame seemed to be used up - when a report surfaced saying that television shows that included her were considered \"too vulgar\" by the regulators and faced a regulatory crackdown - she got a visa for the US. After a few years as a footnote to the last internet dynasty, Luo reappeared, this time as a contracted columnist for iFeng, a website previously affiliated with the Phoenix television network. Surprisingly to many, she has mellowed. Yes, she still throws out the occasional repartee that blends a superiority complex with an inferiority complex. But when she uses the form and length of writing traditionally saved for old media, her persona emerges with more subtlety and maturity. She is able to discuss complicated social, political and cross-cultural issues with earthy humor and sharp insight. Luo\\'s observations of American society, seen from the ultralow perspective of a wannabe immigrant, and the contrast she provides with Chinese society in flux, have exalted her to a position rarely achieved by anyone with better education or pedigree. She gains a ringside view of the US far from the office towers of prestigious media and relays it to a Chinese public who would never bother with a newspaper, let alone its opinion page. Maybe Luo had a split personality from the start. When she was still playing the dating game, some of her poems surfaced, revealing a sensitive soul and a writing proficiency on par with professionals. But they were lost in the crazy whirlwind she had helped whip up around her. Jane Eyre would not have taken this route to fame or fortune, but Luo, a product of reform-era China, has even less to fall back on than the character in the Charlotte Bronte novel. She may not have clawed her way to middle-class respectability yet, but nobody can deny her effort. For her latest posting on Jan 12, titled \"I want your blessings and encouragement\", she received a tidal wave of empathy and appreciation, especially from the huddled masses who used to taunt her.

       " ['China must cut its wasteful ways nan Planners look to big data and other solutions to reduce the enormous amount of food being thrown away Aware that one-third of all food produced in the world is thrown away, governments, institutions and organizations are working on minimizing food waste. In China alone, enough food is discarded in restaurants annually to feed between 30 million and 50 million people. China\\'s challenges were highlighted in late November, when Cheng Shengkui from the Chinese Academy of Sciences told the Food Waste Forum in Beijing that 17 to 18 million tons of food were wasted in China each year from 2013 to 2015. Cheng and his team from the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research surveyed almost 7,000 tables and 366 restaurants in Beijing, Shanghai and the southwestern cities of Lhasa and Chengdu.   - Cooks prepare food at a restaurant in Chengdu, in Southwest China\\'s Sichuan province, on Sept 8 last year. It is estimated that enough food is discarded in restaurants annually in China to feed between 30 million and 50 million people. Provided to China Daily  The team interviewed hundreds of people, collated 7,500 questionnaires and weighed 32,000 dishes. Cheng presented the findings at the seminar hosted by organizations including the United Nations Environment Programme. \"It is no secret that food loss and waste is a big problem,\" says Xie Yuhong, deputy secretary-general of the All-China Environment Federation, a nongovernmental organization supervised by the Ministry of Environmental Protection, during the forum. The problems are myriad, from the methane gas released by food waste into the atmosphere to the fact that discarded food could help to alleviate poverty. One piece of good news is that there are multiple ways to reduce this type of waste, says Luca Mantovani, a consultant at PDA cademia who specializes in facilities management. Big data, for example, can help cafeterias at large companies cut down on waste. Some are tying food production to data from smart cards that employees use to enter buildings. In effect, cafeteria operators can know almost exactly how many people are in the building and how many will go to eat. Big data can also determine what dishes are popular and what dishes are not on given days, depending on who is at work. \"There are buildings that go all out,\" says Mantovani. \"The recycling business in China is quite big.\" The food that consumers throw away is at the tail end of a chain of waste that starts much earlier. In a 2015 study, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum found that 54 percent of waste comes from production, handling, storage, processing and packaging - in other words, in the supply of food. The remaining 46 percent is on the demand side of the equation, including distribution and consumption. Campaigns are under way to reduce this massive footprint. In 2013, for example, the United Nations Environment Programme along with partners launched the Think.Eat.Save initiative to reduce waste. At a more local level, the issue is also significant. In Hong Kong, waste of all types is straining the city\\'s infrastructure to its breaking point. Most discarded food in the city ends up in landfills along with other types of municipal solid waste, which is general garbage from the domestic, commercial and industrial sectors. Some 5.5 million tons of solid waste ended up in Hong Kong\\'s landfills in 2015, with a full third of that being food. The numbers have risen every year since 2010. \"The current practice of disposing of biodegradable food waste at landfills is not sustainable,\" says the Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department. \"Reducing food waste disposal at landfills is an important part of the government\\'s plan for waste management.\" Food is the single largest category of waste in Hong Kong\\'s landfills and the amount is growing every year. Programs are in place to deal with the problem and the government is working to implement a strategy. \"Our wasteful habits put tremendous pressure on the entire waste chain,\" noted the Hong Kong Environment Bureau (which formulates policies to protect the environment and also enforces related legislation) in a blueprint for the sustainable use of resources for 2013 to 2022. \"We have a large \\'waste load\\'. Over the years, Hong Kong people have become more, not less, wasteful,\" it says. Implemented in 2014, the blueprint called for a reduction of solid waste disposal of 20 percent by this year and 40 percent by 2022. By 2013, the daily per capita rate of municipal solid waste had risen to 1.27 kilograms, from 0.97 about a decade earlier. The numbers continued to rise through 2015. At the same time, recycling rates dropped by about a quarter in the decade leading up to 2015. \"It is a pretty protracted process,\" says Gerald Patchell, an associate professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Municipalities in Japan, South Korea and North America all move much faster. In the United States, for example, San Francisco processes all of its waste. \"People make excuses for Hong Kong, and to a certain extent it is valid, about the structure of the city and the environment in a lot of the buildings not having facilities for this type of thing,\" Patchell says. \"Probably the biggest bugbear is this idea that everything is dealt with in Hong Kong.\" In other large cities around the world, trash is sent to the outskirts or hinterland. Hong Kong does not have a big enough region to do that, unless it sends its waste to the Chinese mainland. Personal space is also smaller in Hong Kong, so not a lot of room exists to store, say, multiple containers for different types of trash. One effective program is run by the Airport Authority Hong Kong, the government body which manages the international airport. Since 2003, it has been building and expanding the infrastructure to recycle and dispose of food waste, which is composted into soil used for landscaping. In 2011, the program expanded to collect waste from 17 partners and distribute it to a company that converts it into animal feed. A pilot program in 2014 included a shopping mall near the airport. Some 1,200 tons of food waste were collected from the airport in 2015. That same year, 32 tons of surplus food was picked up in Hong Kong by Food Angel, a nongovernmental organization, and was used to produce 25,000 meal boxes for the city\\'s poor. The airport program is unique but relatively small compared to the thousands of tons of waste that ends up in Hong Kong\\'s three operating landfills. The Hong Kong government aims to develop five to six organic waste treatment facilities that can recycle as much as 1,500 tons per day. The first of these plants began construction in 2014 and is expected to be commissioned this year. It has the capacity to treat as much as 200 tons per day. A second plant, with a daily capacity of 300 tons, is still in the planning stages. But the sheer amount of food waste is creating or exacerbating problems in Hong Kong. There is simply no space to put all that waste. Already, the city\\'s three landfills are running out of space and will all be full by 2019. Hong Kong has already closed 13 landfills. Joyce Chan is the chief operations officer at the Foodlink Foundation, a Hong Kong charity dedicated to reducing food waste. She noted that repurposing food to feed those in need would \"not have an enormous impact on the total amount of food waste that is being disposed into our landfills, but it is still necessary, especially when there is a social need for good-quality, edible food\". But dealing with the issue will require a holistic approach, according to Chan, who says the biggest issues relate to the \"displacement of responsibility\". \"We should not assume that food waste is the responsibility of the food industry, as it is largely demand-driven,\" says Chan. \"If consumers are more conscious of the amount of food waste they generate and everyone plays a role in minimizing their personal food waste, then we can do better as a community.\" For China Daily (China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page18)'],\n",
       " ['From a young age, a ticket to a dream role in paradise nan When Ahmed Asim was a boy his career path had already been laid out before him \"My job is to make people feel at home, literally, since this has been my home for the past 30 years,\" says Ahmed Asim, room director of the St. Regis Vommuli hotel in the Maldives. Between his generation and that of his parents, his country has turned from a gathering of specks in the Indian Ocean to one of the world\\'s best-known and most desired escapes. Yet for Asim, the notion of escape is virtually nonexistent, if not laughable.    \"For me, this only provides an initiation to the outside world as they are coming to us in planeloads.\" His entry into this world came early, he says. When he was at primary school, property owners invited him and his classmates to tour the resort islands, where human endeavor tries to emulate natural beauty in creating paradise on Earth - sometimes with unintended results. \"\\'Wow!\\' was my reaction,\" Asim recalls, casting an incredulous look. \"Then I told myself: \\'Someday I\\'m going to work here.\\'\" The wide-eyed child has given way to a soft-spoken man with a confident air, and in the meantime he has gained a diploma in hospitality and worked as a trainee butler and then as a butler for many years in a number of hotels, some of them luxury ones. He joined the St. Regis at Vommuli as room director in October, when preparations were being made for the hotel\\'s grand opening. \"Between 50 and 60 percent of our 300-strong staff are Maldivians,\" Asim says. \"Quite a few of us, including me, are in management.\" Spending the bulk of his time in air-conditioned rooms or traveling in buggies from villa to villa, Asim\\'s life is a world apart from that of his parents, who have seven children in total. \"Like most Maldivian families of their generation, my father made a living out of fishing while my mother did household chores. The sea around here is probably the calmest on Earth. I\\'ve never heard of anyone who died out fishing in the sea. But still, the sun and the wind can be unforgiving; that\\'s why few young people are involved in fishing today.\" His father usually left home about 5:30 am and fished for tuna all day before returning in the evening, he says. \"Ours was a small boat. There were also bigger boats on which one can go out fishing in the sea for weeks at a time. But whatever you go out in, small or big, fishing in the Maldives has to be by pole instead of by net. We do angling all the time. The fish nets are reserved only for the capture of baitfish - fish used as bait when angling. \"Our government has been very aggressive when it comes to environmental protection. That\\'s why we still have what we had 20 or 30 years ago.\" Asked whether angling is a financially viable way of fishing, Asim says that on a good day, a good angler can catch up to 2,000 tuna. The fish tend to appear in groups, and when you really think about it, that kind of catch suggests the fish must be virtually jumping onto the hook, if not directly into the boat. These days, though, fishing has decreased compared with 20 years ago. Asim\\'s parents stopped fishing about 15 years ago and now live in Male, the country\\'s capital. The catch, apart from fulfilling local needs, goes on to the dining tables of tourists. At the St. Regis, amid offerings of caviar, lobster, truffle, foie gras and Kobe beef, I discovered a course unpretentiously titled \"Catch of the day\". I tried it and did not regret my decision. Later, as I spent my last day in the Maldives at the Sheraton on Full Moon Island, I encountered the same offering and realized that it was a local signature dish. Ayyoub Salameh, director of culinary service at the St. Regis, says the hotel buys 600 kilograms of fish each day from local fishermen for the consumption of guests and hotel staff. It also buys produce from local farmers. \"I don\\'t think I\\'ll stay in the country for life, so I\\'m going to deliver something for it,\" says the master cook, a Jordanian, who is also creating a garden for local spices and herbs. Similar willingness is also expressed by Wong Chiu Man and his wife Maria Warner Wong, the architectural duo and Harvard graduates who designed the St. Regis at Vommuli. \"The Vommuli House is inspired by the extending roots of banyan trees,\" Warner Wong says. \"The parts were prefabricated and pre-engineered before being sent to Vommuli for rapid erection with the help of Maldivian workers. In this way we have tried to be environmentally friendly while passing on construction skills to locals.\" Once, the couple was invited for a drink at a nearby island, only to discover that the hostess, a Maldivian who had previously worked on the construction site at Vommuli, had fashioned her little bar using discarded plywood she had gathered from the St. Regis site. Wong Chiu Man, asked about any misgivings he has about the hotel\\'s design, said that if he had his chance again he would pay greater heed to any risks such a project posed to the environment. \"The construction of the water villas did cause the bleaching of corals on a scale I hate to see.\" But as tourists pour in, won\\'t further stress be put on the country\\'s unspoiled beauty and fragile ecosystem? \"I don\\'t see that happening,\" Asim says. \"First of all, the Maldives is a high-end tourist destination, as we cater to a niche market. This is especially true in our case. For the moment, the government has adopted a very positive attitude toward developing tourism. A college in Male offers a master\\'s degree in hospitality and tourism.\" However, he acknowledges that even though tourists started coming to the Maldives in the 1970s, it is only in the past five years that the country\\'s tourism industry has really taken off. Asim, married with a two-and-a-half-year-old son, sees differences in the ways childhoods were spent before and now. \"For me it was just the sun, sand and sea; for him it\\'s more about colorful toys.\" Because of Asim\\'s job, he can see his wife and son as often as he would like to. Fan Qianyi, a Chinese diving coach at Vommuli, says this kind of family living arrangement is common among young Maldivians. \"I\\'ve been here for four years but haven\\'t seen many Maldivian women. Usually men work outside, on resort islands, while women and children stay behind, in what\\'s known as the local islands. It reminds me of migrant workers in China - certainly not the best solution.\" Twenty years ago, when Asim first visited a luxury hotel at a resort, he dreamed of being part of what he saw. He has higher hopes for his son. \"I won\\'t object if he wants to go into the tourism industry - my parents have been very encouraging and all my brothers work in catering - but it would be great if he becomes a doctor or a lawyer.\" For some Maldivians, a simple life, though hard, may have started to change along with their long-held sense of contentment. But with all the building and opening of luxury hotels, is there any talk about possible gentrification, the effect of which might be mitigated by the geographical isolation of each island? \"Such an idea has yet to come to the Maldives,\" Asim says.

A survey by Spring Professional, a subsidiary of human resources company Adecco Group, found that interest among top foreign talent in working in China has risen nearly 150 percent over the past five years. Yet fears over the environment and climate have also increased. Fifty-five percent of 2,000 foreign employees that Spring Professional polled last year - who had each lived in the country for at least five years - said they had concerns about air quality, up from 23 percent in 2012.   - China has been watched closely by foreign job applicants in recent years due to the rapid development of its economy and its openness to overseas talent, but air pollution has hurt the recruitment. Guo Junfeng / For China Daily  Air pollution has hurt recruitment for the past two years, says Ma Erman, head of overseas recruitment for language training company EF English in Shijiazhuang, Hebei province. \"During interview processes, foreign applicants frequently check the air quality index,\" she says. \"Many will turn down an offer after thinking carefully about their health. For those who work here in Shijiazhuang, all of them will visit the hospital several times, especially during winter. \"Hebei doesn\\'t have many advantages to compete with coastal provinces, which have better economies and offer higher salaries, and air pollution is making recruitment even more difficult.\" According to data provided by the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the average daily concentration of PM2.5 - small particulate matter that is hazardous to health - in the country\\'s 31 provinces, autonomous regions and provinces was 47 micrograms per cubic meter last year, down by 6 percent from 2015 levels.

China has been watched closely by foreign job applicants in recent years due to the rapid development of its economy and its openness to overseas talent. Hu Xin, a senior consultant at Spring Professional, says China has become more competitive in the talent war compared with five years ago. \"China has an advantage over European countries, whose economy, social order and political situations are deteriorating,\" Hu says. \"In 2015 and 2016, many private firms in China had a growing demand for high-end overseas technical talent and they are willing to provide attractive salaries and opportunities for promotion.\" However, many expats are having second thoughts as air pollution has become a long-term issue.

Demand is so high that such websites, which first began to emerge in 2014, make as much at Spring Festival as they do during the rest of the year combined. To post an ad, users must register with their personal information, including age, occupation and height, and upload a headshot. Clients can list special requirements. They are required to pay a deposit - usually half the rental price - and must submit proof of identity and employment. Platforms charge a service fee of 10 to 20 percent.

The ratio of men to women is 10:1. Such a gender imbalance is common, which Wang put down to women having more safety concerns.

China will firmly safeguard its maritime sovereignty, as it holds talks with countries directly involved, to maintain stability in the region, she said. Hua had been asked to respond to White House spokesman Sean Spicer\\'s comment on Jan 23 that \"the US would make sure that we protect our interests\" in the South China Sea. On Jan 11, Trump\\'s secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson said that China should be denied access to the South China Sea islands. Hua, when asked whether China worried that the Trump administration would take further steps regarding the sea, said that China is not the only country concerned about that. \"China\\'s position on the South China Sea is consistent, and our actions are justified,\" she said. Tensions have cooled over the South China Sea issue since China and other countries involved, including the Philippines, agreed to peacefully solve disputes through negotiations. In October, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte made a state visit to China, during which the two nations agreed to restore bilateral ties that had been jeopardized by the ruling of an arbitration unilaterally launched by his predecessor, Benigno Aquino III. \"Any responsible country should be glad to see this trend, and play a positive role in promoting regional peace and stability,\" Hua said on Jan 24. Li Haidong, a professor of US studies at China Foreign Affairs University, said the Trump administration\\'s attitude toward the South China Sea is similar to his predecessor\\'s - namely, emphasizing disputes there. \"While Obama dealt with it in so-called multilateral and legal ways, Trump might try to get rough and try to overwhelm China with force there,\" he said. The South China Sea will continue to be an increasingly disputed area between the two countries, he speculated. However, Li said, it remained to be seen whether Washington would follow up on Tillerson\\'s proposal because of \"Trump\\'s unpredictability and the different opinions within the Cabinet\". \"The Trump administration might make an adjustment, adopt a more practical China policy after six months, when it sees it has failed to force China to concede to its aggressive manner regarding issues Washington believes are critical,\" he added.

The proportion was around 30 percent before 2013. \"It demonstrates that the universal second-child policy came in time and worked effectively,\" Yang said.   - Second-child policy implemented early last year was a major factor in raising the number of births in China to 17.86 million last year. Provided to China Daily  \"Some regions, mostly large cities in eastern areas, began recording second children as comprising more than half of local newborns,\" he added. Yang expected that by 2020, the number of new births each year would stand between 17 and 20 million in China, citing expert estimates. Ma Xiaowei, deputy director of the commission, said recently a baby boom triggered largely by the new policy would probably come within the next two years. For that, the commission plans to add 140,000 more maternity health workers in the coming years, he said. The top decision-makers intensified efforts in late 2013 to adjust birth policies in place for three decades that limited most couples to just one child, hoping to address major demographic challenges such as an aging population and a looming labor shortage. Starting in early 2014, couples of which one person was an only child could have a second child. The universal second-child policy was implemented at the start of 2016. \"The long-term effect of the universal second-child policy is very helpful to China\\'s sustainable development,\" says Yuan Xin, a professor of population studies at Nankai University in Tianjin. By 2050, the policy is expected to bring about an extra 30 million working-age people and reduce the nation\\'s aging rate by 2 percent, commission projections show. But matching policies have not yet been refined to provide good support for couples willing to have more than one child, particularly in terms of maternity education and health services, Yang conceded. A 2015 survey by the commission found nearly 75 percent of respondents were reluctant to have a second baby, largely due to economic burdens. Other major concerns are age, parents\\' career development and a lack of caregivers, it showed. Yuan suggested the government introduce support measures like favorable tax policies, prolonged maternity leave and education for families with two children. shanjuan@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page14)'],\n",

The agreement was the latest evidence of warming ties between China and the Philippines. While the specific types of deals and locations were not revealed, the package is the initial installment of planned cooperative projects aiming to improve livelihoods, Minister of Commerce Gao Hucheng told reporters at a news briefing. The briefing came after discussions with a delegation led by Philippines Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez. Dominguez, in China from Jan 22 to Jan 24, led a heavyweight delegation, including ministerial officials responsible for areas such as economic planning, telecommunications, financing and public projects. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that several Filipino ministers have led delegations to China recently to discuss such areas as trade, infrastructure and energy. It has \"fully showcased the consistent increase in mutual trust and increasingly deepened cooperative relationships,\" Hua said on Jan 23. Also on Jan 23, the two sides agreed to a speedy resumption of meetings of the China-Philippines Joint Commission on Economic and Trade Cooperation, an important body that ground to a halt in 2012 as the relationship deteriorated over territorial sovereignty issues. Vice-Premier Wang Yang, who met with the Philippines delegation, said the countries also should gear up their joint efforts in drafting a plan for bilateral economic and trade cooperation and press ahead with their priority bilateral projects. China is now the second-largest trade partner of the Philippines. The relationship warmed markedly after Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte paid his first state visit to China in October. Duterte is expected to make a second trip to China in May to attend an international forum on building the China-led Belt and Road Initiative. Manila is seeking greater infrastructure cooperation within the initiative\\'s framework, Dominguez said. \"We think that both our governments, as well as both our peoples, will move quickly to support (projects under) this initiative in the Philippines.\" Luo Yongkun, a researcher in Southeast Asian studies at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, noted that although the Philippines\\' economy has seen rapid growth in the past few years, it is still weak in infrastructure and is in need of foreign investment.

Starting Jan 23, vast regions in the provinces of Hebei and Henan will see an increase in smog, which is forecast to persist and worsen until Friday, Spring Festival eve, the Ministry of Environmental Protection said. The smog is expected to gradually disperse from north to south due to winds. The National Environmental Monitoring Center also forecast severe smog for parts of Hebei, Shandong and Henan provinces, though it said the forecast for the coming weekend might not be accurate due to the changing weather and emissions situation. Among the 13 cities, six were listed in the top-10 cities with severe air pollution in 2016: Hengshui, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Handan and Xingtai of Hebei, and Zhengzhou of Henan. The ministry has sent the forecast to the governments of these areas, suggesting they issue emergency alerts for air pollution in advance, and saying that violators will be punished severely. The ministry said it will closely monitor major emission sources such as large companies via remote sensing and online monitoring technologies.  (China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page15)'],\n",
       " ['Democracy or humility? Why not both? nan Recent shock polling results have opened the world\\'s eyes to the fact that no form of government is totally flawless Democracy, as Britain\\'s wartime prime minister Winston Churchill is often quoted as saying, is the worst form of government except for all the others. Even if he did not say precisely that, it is how his pithy aphorism is best remembered. It is a handy phrase for democrats to fall back on when democracy appears to be under pressure. China\\'s People\\'s Daily reflected recently that Western-style democracy used to be recognized as a historical driver of social development. But now, it has reached its limits. In an analysis that will find an echo among many disgruntled voters in the West, it suggested democracy had been hijacked as a weapon for capitalists to boost their profits. A widespread sentiment within Western electorates, that they have been ignored and left behind by self-perpetuating elites, is seen as a key factor in recent election and referendum results in the US and Britain and may play a role in future outcomes of 2017.    On the face of it, the Brexit referendum vote in Britain and Donald Trump\\'s victory in the US should be regarded as a vindication of the democratic system - the people were given a choice and they have made their decision. Both results, however, have spurred soul-searching about what these outcomes mean for the future of a political system that is intended to safeguard the interests of all its citizens, not just those who picked the winner. A worrying trend that has emerged is a \"winner-takes-all\" attitude among the victors. Among some who voted for Brexit on the ostensible grounds that it would allow the UK to regain its democratic rights from an undemocratic European Union, a discomfiting tendency has emerged to delegitimize the views of those who continue to warn about the negative consequences of that decision. For example, the UK\\'s pro-Brexit Daily Mail newspaper described a legal challenge to launching Brexit without the assent of Parliament as an unpatriotic attempt to subvert the will of the people. It is an attitude of \"We won, you lost, shut up\". Similarly, in the US, there are fears that the new administration has little tolerance for the kind of dissent displayed by demonstrators on the streets of Washington the day after President Donald Trump\\'s inauguration. Those fears may be misplaced and, to be fair to Trump, he conceded that \"peaceful protests are a hallmark of our democracy\" after earlier castigating the demonstrators for overlooking the results of the election.    A prevailing view among liberal analysts, however, and more than a few conservative commentators, is that Trump\\'s brand of populism poses a threat to American democratic values. A Washington Post article by veteran conservative commentator George Will referred to Trump\\'s \"feral cunning in manipulating the masses and the media\" and implicitly criticized the hostile tone the new president has adopted toward China and others. Others have decried the authoritarian tendencies Trump displayed during his campaign and his alleged anti-democratic behavior since the election. \"Donald J. Trump\\'s election has raised a question that few Americans ever imagined asking: Is our democracy in danger?\" academics Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt told readers of the New York Times back in December. Little over a quarter-century ago, the American political scientist Francis Fukuyama was arguing that the spread of liberal democracy and free market capitalism might be the endpoint of humanity\\'s social evolution. It has been something of a rocky road since then. But it is perhaps a little premature to write off democracy as a system that has brought no positive benefits to those societies where it has evolved. Recent events should, however, generate some humility within the democratic camp and a recognition that other societies with other histories and cultures have taken a different road. Within the international context, what is important is to reinforce the partnerships that have evolved since World War II among societies at various stages of social, political and economic development to tackle the daunting challenges that we all face.

       " ['Ranking China\\'s global brand builders nan As the Chinese economy continues its transition from low-cost production to high-quality premium brands, the new year began with the release of the first BrandZ Top 30 Chinese Brand Builders\\' ranking and report earlier this month. This report is the result of groundbreaking, new research that provides tremendous insight into the brand-building progress made by Chinese companies in overseas markets. The research methodology focuses on overseas consumers\\' attitudes, beliefs and feelings toward Chinese brands. Chinese companies and China\\'s image have been subjected to considerable investigative research over many years, but rarely have Chinese product and service brands been singled out with an in-depth, mainly qualitative research study. In total, 167 established Chinese brands were included in the study, for which consumers were surveyed across seven of the world\\'s most developed market economies: the United Kindom, France, Spain, Germany, the United States, Australia and Japan. World-leading advertising and public relations agency WPP and global market research company Kantar Millward Brown collaborated with Google to produce the pioneering report.    The report\\'s overall findings make for extremely encouraging reading for those Chinese brands hoping to continue their expansion deeper into overseas markets. More and more Chinese brands now enjoy increasing brand awareness levels. But the report\\'s most significant claim concludes that the circumstances are now very favorable for Chinese brands to build powerful brands based on their high quality and emotional connections with overseas consumers. Lenovo, China\\'s PC giant and the world\\'s largest producer by sales volume, was named the most powerful Chinese global brand builder at present. This should come as no surprise, given Lenovo\\'s clear commitment to international expansion ever since its audacious acquisition of the IBM PC brand well over 10 years ago. Close behind Lenovo comes another consumer electronics brand success story in the shape of Huawei, China\\'s giant multinational networking and telecommunications equipment and services company, headquartered in South China\\'s city of Shenzhen, in Guangdong province. In recent years, Huawei has proven it can compete with even its fiercest rivals, such as Apple and Samsung. Huawei\\'s acclaimed P9 smartphone provides demonstrable proof of the company\\'s commitment to technological innovation, high quality standards, brand building and it is rumored that an even better model, the Huawei P10, could be launched very soon. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba is ranked third, which should also come as no surprise, given its fairly recent listing on the US stock exchange.    Chinese consumer electronics brands represent a large share of the higher-ranked brands, with smartphone brand Xiaomi coming in at number 5, the third consumer electronics brand in the top 5. The report finds that these higher-ranked brands now compete far less in price than they used to and have gained an enviable reputation for quality, reliability and service in the minds of overseas consumers. But in addition to a cluster of strong consumer electronics brands, Chinese internet brands are also making more than a good name for themselves around the world and are seen by many overseas consumers as very competitively innovative. The report does still present challenges facing Chinese brands in their quest for global recognition and relevance. Overseas consumers, despite growing acceptance of and trust in Chinese brands, reveal an almost habitual reach toward longer-established global brands, rather than the Chinese \"new kids on the block\". But even this habit appears to be waning, as Chinese brands prove themselves more and more and rely on price less and less. It is also apparent from the report that consumer likelihood of purchasing a Chinese brand over an established, non-Chinese rival brand varies from country to country. In France, Germany and Spain, for instance, consumers appear far more likely to consume a Chinese brand, while Japanese, British and American consumers still hold stronger attachments to locally produced brands. Furthermore, geographical proximity can, at least partially, contribute to brand recognition. There may also be some sort of \"hangover\" effect taking place, due to which American and Japanese consumers still hang on to the past, even the very recent past, when their countries were widely seen as technological pioneers. But now, according to the study, consumers are increasingly looking to China and Chinese companies for the latest technology breakthroughs, making now the most opportune time for Chinese brands to penetrate global markets. Gone is China\\'s image of low prices and low quality in its products and brands. This decline in negativity, which dogged Chinese brand building in the past, has also been matched by an increase in consumer involvement when deciding on brand consumption choice. The report finds that fame alone is no longer as significant a factor as it once was when consumers choose brands. Instead, a more rational, conscious and self-confident consumer now places tangible benefits and relevance higher. This has helped Chinese brands compete with brands which have enjoyed international fame for far longer. Harnessing the power of the internet also explains the international rise of many Chinese brands, such as Alibaba and Tencent. Chinese, internet-driven brands have shown that it is not necessary to initially focus on the domestic market to ensure steady growth, but that internet-driven innovation can allow a brand to explode on to the global scene with almost overnight success. Despite a welter of positive findings, the report does also provide a sobering assessment of the challenges facing Chinese brands in increasingly competitive overseas markets. High among these challenges is the need for even more creativity and innovation, perhaps not in the use of the latest technology, but in brands\\' marketing initiatives. Innovation in technology is an absolute necessity on today\\'s global battle of the brands, but it is not on its own sufficient. Brands have to build on this very tangible form of growth with layer upon layer of emotional meaning that resonates with consumers\\' increasing need for emotionally-fulfilling lifestyle experiences. Creativity in all aspects of a brand\\'s appearance and promotion is now the next hurdle for Chinese companies to overcome. But even here, there are encouraging signs, with Chinese companies such as Huawei investing heavily in sports and entertainment sponsorships to build emotional connections with overseas consumers, augmenting its reputation for quality and service. So what could this all mean for European businesses? Should Chinese brands be seen as friend or foe? At a glance, the answer to this question may appear to be the latter, but looking into the question further should yield a different conclusion. This is good news for European industries in which the rise of Chinese brands internationally represents many substantial opportunities. Chinese brands will now be seeking more long-term cooperation with European partners all along the supply chain, for example. European brands can also now see their Chinese competitors as an opportunity to learn from their technological excellence, in particular. The idea that the rise of Chinese brands internationally poses a significant threat should be dispelled when pinpointing the sources of Chinese brands\\' success. It was, and still is, the firm presence of Western brands across the China mainland that initiated this brand-building path. Chinese companies learned extensively from these newly arrived Western brands and were spurred on to become even more competitive than their established Western rivals. If Chinese brands can rise to the arrival of Western brands in China, then surely European brands can do likewise now that more and more Chinese brands have arrived in their backyard.

       " ['China could withstand a trade war nan Nation has the resources to survive Trump\\'s threatened onslaught and create prosperity internally In the Chinese press, offline and online, business commentators are nowadays all talking about the same thing: the coming trade war with the United States. But whether there will be a full-scale trade war is up to Donald Trump, because that\\'s what he said he wanted. What the Chinese should do is not just talk, explaining that trade war isn\\'t a good thing. They can do many things, starting right now, to make the economy less vulnerable to outside influences and stronger against imminent trade war attacks. No matter on how many fronts and how seemingly powerful the trade war is, it comes from the outside after all. How much resistance an economy can mobilize depends primarily on internal factors. Having long foreseen the unsustainability of its export-driven growth since the 1990s, China has, beginning almost 10 years ago, been gradually reducing its dependence on foreign trade.    Not only has the total volume of its exports been in decline, the ratio between export and total GDP fell from 37 percent 10 years ago to around 20 percent, according to the World Bank. Although it is higher than the US level, it is lower than that of many trading nations in Asia and Europe. Admittedly, in volume, the figure for China\\'s export of goods to the US is still much larger than that for imports, registered as $482 billion versus $116 billion by the Office of the US Trade Representative. But a large proportion of it was made-for-US consumer brands. Should US businesses discard the production they have partnered with in China and ship the $300 billion-plus-worth of business entirely home, that would be more than 2 trillion yuan ($308.6 billion; 208.6 billion euros; 184.9 billion), as compared with China\\'s total GDP of some 74 trillion yuan in 2016, or less than 3 percent of the latter. It may not be extremely hard for China to redirect that amount of productivity to other markets, domestic and foreign. At least mathematically, Chinese society has become different from the way it was 20 years ago. A rise in the general income level in coastal cities should have created enough middle class consumers who want to spend more, evidence of which is also seen in data for the spending of Chinese tourists abroad. With smart management, China may better utilize that new potential of its society, to provide its middle class consumers with goods of better quality and better services.    One handy example is the rapid expansion of the high-speed rail network. At the beginning of the rail modernization program, many people doubted its commercial viability. In fact, many of the long, hugely expensive railways cannot be expected to generate a profit in a just two to three years. But the nation\\'s consumer behavior has changed quickly, with an increasing number of people willing to travel for holidays and weekends on the speedy and decent train rides to cities other than their home towns. In 2015, by serving 4 billion visitors, the nation generated 4 trillion yuan in tourist revenue, a much larger amount than its merchandise trade surplus with the US. In 2017, some major high-speed railways were completed to link the more developed coastal cities with the scenic towns in the mountainous West China. With good security protection and more entrepreneurial initiatives, China\\'s \"high-speed rail economy\" alone can generate enough to compare with the GDP of a medium-sized nation. So in the face of Trump\\'s statements, the best defense China can have is to never get distracted by his attacks and deceits and be steadfast in pursuing its own economic reform. This is the most effective way China can win the future trade war. The government should do a better job not only in investing in large infrastructure, but also in protecting small enterprises and private initiatives - with good laws and policy terms. It should start acting now. The author is editor-at-large of China Daily. Contact the writer atedzhang@chinadaily.com.cn.  (China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page13)'],\n",
       " ['Momentum gives hope in a challenging year nan Despite uncertainties, indicators are good for reasonable growth, giving the nation\\'s policymakers some leeway While both global trade and China\\'s economy enter 2017 with decent growth momentum, we expect GDP growth to ease to 6.3 percent this year due to a harsher climate for China\\'s exports in the United States, slower real estate investment and, importantly, a change in tone of policymakers toward somewhat less emphasis on growth. Real GDP growth edged up to 6.8 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2016 as services output momentum picked up. This brought whole-year GDP growth to 6.7 percent, down from 6.9 percent in 2015 but comfortably exceeding the \"bottom line\" of the 6.5 to 7 percent target range. However, this was at the cost of a further rise in leverage. Overall credit - total social financing excluding equity financing, but including local government bond issuance - grew 16.1 percent in 2016. Rebalancing continued last year. With the service sector outpacing industry and price changes also in favor of services, its share in GDP climbed by 1.2 percentage points to 51.9 percent.    Investment momentum picked up in the fourth quarter of 2016, having weakened mid-year, with growth of fixed asset investment rising to 7.9 percent, supported by some improvement in corporate investment. Surprisingly, real estate fixed asset investment also accelerated again in the fourth quarter in spite of measures taken in large cities to contain housing price increases. Consumption remained robust in the fourth quarter, with real retail sales growth 9.1 percent, although passenger car sales slowed in December. The growth in exports of real goods slowed to 1.4 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter. But the three month moving average, the seasonally adjusted monthly export volume, rose a full 4 percent in December, pointing to solid export momentum going into 2017. Consumer price inflation eased in December to 1.9 percent year-on-year on lower food price increases. While the producer price index rose a full 5.5 percent year-on-year, we expect the spurt to run out of steam in the first half of 2017 and forecast consumer price index inflation to remain comfortably below the likely target of 3 percent in 2017, suggesting no major monetary policy implications.    Looking ahead, recent global trade indicators show a decent momentum going into 2017 and we expect it to grow by 2.7 percent this year, from 1.4 percent in 2016. Indeed, China should in principle benefit from any pick-up in growth in the US from more expansionary fiscal policy under the new Trump administration. But, while we do not expect across-the board tariffs, it is clear to us that China\\'s exports to the US will face a harsher climate. Overall, we expect the export outlook to improve somewhat next year. Domestically, infrastructure investment should remain solid. And corporate investment should benefit from renewed profit growth. But the tightening of housing purchasing restrictions in many large cities will weigh on real estate investment. We expect consumption growth to ease further on moderating wage growth, but to remain relatively solid. Meanwhile, the messages from the Central Economic Work Conference and other recent statements suggest policymakers are moving to put somewhat more emphasis on reducing financial risks and less on ensuring at least 6.5 percent GDP growth. The Central Economic Work Conference provided a mandate for further fiscal expansion but called for a less generous monetary stance. We do not expect a benchmark interest rate rise this year but expect policymakers to guide overall credit growth down to around 14 percent in 2017. Overall, we expect GDP growth to slow to 6.3 percent this year. High uncertainty means Chinese economic policymakers will want to keep their options open. But at least the reasonable current growth momentum gives policy some two-way leeway. The author is the Hong Kong-based head of Asia economics for Oxford Economics.

       " ['Controlling the looming economic risks nan China should strengthen communication about its policies and takes steps to stabilize its exchange rate According to the latest Central Economic Work Conference of China, preventing and controlling risks is a very important part of its policies. While the global market is in a period of flux, preventing and controlling financial risks in China is more meaningful than ever. Developed countries, such as European countries and the US, have seen the effects of globalization and are taking steps to encourage overseas capital and manufacturing industries to come back to the developed economies. Meanwhile, many countries, including China, no longer have the advantage of cheaper labor costs. These factors could result in some changes in the global industrial chain\\'s specialization and then influence international capital flow. To the emerging markets, including China, this can mean capital outflow and more challenges in export. The differentiation of global monetary policies and the expected rise of interest rates would help drive capital to flow from emerging markets to the developed countries. China should prevent the risks brought by both the real estate industry and RMB exchange rate at the same time. In the past few years, a large amount of global capital entered the emerging markets in different ways and gathered at the real estate industry and stock market, where the profit rates were relatively high. As China\\'s own currency was not the international reserve currency, there are problems with currency and maturity mismatch.    Once policies change, the previously in-flowed capital will be evacuated rapidly, which could cause the collapse of assets value, depreciation of the RMB, the slump of the stock market and other systematic risks. At present, the US dollar is becoming stronger, and the RMB is under great pressure of depreciation. Meanwhile, the domestic real estate market is under stricter control and capital outflow is growing stronger. If the real estate market is over-cooled or causing individuals to sell their properties and invest overseas, this will aggravate the depreciation of the RMB. Under these circumstances, the control policies over real estate should be tailored for different cities, rather than being the same throughout all of China. A certain degree of capital control needs to be maintained, especially the supervision of capital outflow of companies that are following China\\'s \"going out\" strategies. For example, some companies are disregarding cost when doing overseas acquisitions, paying high prices for no reason. China should strengthen communication about its policies and take steps to stabilize its exchange rate. China should also be cautious of unexpected, rapid inflation. Since last year, the producer price index (PPI) of industrial products has been much higher due to supply-side reform and exchange rate fluctuation. The consistent rise of the PPI will affect the consumer price index (CPI). If we take international factors into account, Donald Trump\\'s policies to help with the US\\' inflation and economic recovery could also lead to global expectation of inflation, which would indirectly influence China\\'s domestic bonds, stock market and commodities prices. Moreover, if the inflation exceeds expectation, it would restrict what China\\'s monetary policies could do, making it difficult to prevent and control future financial risks. It is also crucial to prevent global sources from spreading financial risks to China in the current global political and economic environment. In Europe, political turbulence has affected the financial market in the Eurozone. Several important elections will be held this year, including those of the French president and German chancellor, and Brexit is to be carried out soon. The banking system in the eurozone also faces challenges, especially the fragile banking system in Italy, which could affect other banks in the eurozone. These factors will affect the eurozone, even global trade and monetary policies, and have a huge impact on the global financial market. In the US, new President Donald Trump\\'s policies could raise uncertainties and influence global expectations for inflation and the global financial market. Trump might make big changes to the US\\' current macro policies. Trump\\'s stated policies on trade are a form of de-globalization, which may, in a short time, affect China\\'s exports and apply more pressure to the RMB. At present, it seems China has underestimated the changes that might take place in the China-US relationship after Trump takes office. As many low-income people in developed countries didn\\'t benefit much from globalization, Trump\\'s policies will cater to their desires. China should negotiate on that, should the free trade process be blocked. If Trump\\'s fiscal policy is carried out, it will encourage the rising expectation of inflation, likely causing the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates to deal with inflation, further pressuring China\\'s RMB depreciation.

Nation exceeds urban job creation target China created 13.14 million new jobs for urban residents last year, exceeding the official target, but the country faces a new challenge this year in creating jobs for a historic high of almost 8 million university graduates. The registered unemployment rate in Chinese cities stood at 4.02 percent at the end of last year, down from 4.04 percent three months earlier, Lu Aihong, an official with the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, said at a news conference on Jan 23. 1,800 detained for illegally crossing border Border-control police in South China\\'s Guangdong province detained more than 1,800 foreigners entering the country illegally last year, a 190-percent increase compared with 2015, according to officials at the provincial border-control department. The total number of people detained for illegally entering or exiting the country was 2,571, an increase of 99.3 percent year-on-year, which involved 337 cases, officials said. Among them, 192 cases involved 1,879 foreigners illegally entering China. Crackdown sees 111 golf courses closed China has closed more than 100 golf courses and ordered 507 others to make changes over the past five years as part of a clampdown on illegal land and water use, according to the National Development and Reform Commission. The golf courses were guilty of illicit behavior, including illegally using large amounts of arable land or natural reserves, and extracting groundwater from prohibited areas, the commission said. Couple set for flight around the world    A Chinese couple with a penchant for adventure are planning an 80,000-kilometer round-the-world trip that will see them fly themselves to five continents, including Antarctica. Zhang Xinyu and his wife, Liang Hong, plan to begin their journey by flying a Chinese-made plane from Harbin, capital of Heilongjiang province, to North America via the Russian Far East. Their trip is scheduled to begin before the end of this month, and the adventure will last until June. Li: More foreign talent welcome More foreign talent is welcome to China for innovative work and business, and the government will step up support in such areas as granting \"green cards\", project applications and intellectual property protection, Premier Li Keqiang said. The country will also \"relax market access, attract more foreign investment and learn advanced technologies and management\", Li told a gathering in Beijing of outstanding foreign experts working in China. Xi tells Hebei to hasten overcapacity reduction Hebei province needs to quicken the pace of overcapacity reduction this year, President Xi Jinping said on Jan 24. Xi said stepped-up efforts would lead to healthy economic growth through developing emerging industries such as dairy production. There should be zero tolerance for allowing \"zombie\" factories and enterprises previously shut down to restart operations, he said. Cheating must not be permitted, the president said. WHO put on \\'high alert\\' for bird flu The World Health Organization has called on all countries to closely monitor outbreaks of deadly bird flu in birds and poultry, and to promptly report any human cases that could signal the start of a flu pandemic. Different strains of bird flu have been spreading across Europe and Asia since late last year, leading to large-scale slaughter of poultry in some countries and occasional human deaths in China. Experts fear the virus could mutate to spread more easily among people. Nearly 40 countries have reported new outbreaks of the highly pathogenic bird flu in poultry or wild birds since November, according to the WHO. Beijing to push talks on regional free trade pacts Beijing said on Jan 24 that it will support ongoing deliberation for two free-trade arrangements in the Asia-Pacific region after the United States quit the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China will stay committed to pressing ahead with the economic integration process in the Asia-Pacific region. Beijing will further promote the negotiation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, since the negotiations have made substantial progress and should be completed at an early date, Hua said. US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan 23 to withdraw the country from the TPP. Tap TCM\\'s potential, premier says Premier Li Keqiang called for traditional Chinese medicine producers on Jan 24, during a visit to Yunnan province, to introduce advanced methods from developed economies to make diversified products and improve people\\'s health. The premier spoke with managers and researchers of Yunnan Baiyao Group Co in Kunming. Li said traditional Chinese medicine has great potential for development of new products and expansion in overseas markets. In the bigger picture, the company can develop more manufactured goods under the category of dietary supplements. Report of new type of passport dismissed Guo Shaochun, director general of the Foreign Ministry\\'s Department of Consular Affairs has dismissed a fake online report that claims China will issue a \"frequent traveler passport\" that would grant holders visa-free trips to 141 countries. He reminded the public to get authoritative information from two sources: his department\\'s website and its Wechat account. Currently, there are three main types of passports for Chinese citizens - diplomat, service and regular passports. Graduates urged to work for grassroots units The central government issued a guideline on Jan 24, urging departments to encourage college graduates to work for grassroots units in remote areas. The guideline stated that grassroots work experience should be a mandatory requirement for civil service applicants eyeing provincial-level posts. More training and field studies should be organized to prepare the students for work with grassroots organizations, according to the guideline. 3,800 arrested for IP rights crimes Nearly 3,800 people were arrested in China for crimes related to intellectual property rights violations last year, the Supreme People\\'s Procuratorate announced on Jan 24. More than 7,000 people were prosecuted for violating IPR last year, the SPP said. According to official statistics, more than 3,500 people were arrested for crimes involving trademark infringement, accounting for more than 92 percent of all IPR offenders last year. Program aired to mark anniversary The Shanghai People\\'s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries published a documentary on Jan 24 to celebrate its 60th anniversary. The 20-minute documentary, entitled People-to-People Diplomacy: Six Decades of Shining Glories, gives a brief account of the organization, which was founded on Sept 13, 1956. By 2015, the organization had established exchange relationships with 345 organizations in 100 countries. Duo sent to prison over illegal vaccine trade A woman and her daughter were sentenced to prison terms on Jan 24 after being convicted of selling vaccines without a license in Shandong province, according to a local court. Pang Hongwei was sentenced to 15 years in prison for illegally purchasing vaccines and then selling them to clients in the province and other parts of the country between June 2013 and April 2015, according to the Jinan Intermediate People\\'s Court. Pang improperly stored the vaccines she bought, and sold them for a total sales value of nearly 75 million yuan ($11 million), the court said. Investment will help protect farmland China will invest 600 billion yuan ($87.5 billion) in the next four years to protect farmland and improve its facilities, an official said on Jan 24, as the country is set to encourage more private capital to participate in the farmland improvement process. Han Jun, deputy director of the Office of the Central Leading Group for Rural Work, said a national effort to increase the area of well-facilitated farmland from the current 26.7 million hectares to 53.3 million hectares by 2020 could cost about 600 billion yuan, and authorities will encourage private capital to take part in the process. The group is China\\'s top rural affairs decision-making agency. New leader takes helm of PLA Navy    The People\\'s Liberation Army Navy has a new commander, 60-year-old Vice-Admiral Shen Jinlong, according to the Navy. Shen has replaced Admiral Wu Shengli, 71, to take charge of the largest navy in Asia. Shen was chosen because of his rich experience with front-line combat units, institutes and a major fleet\\'s commanding body, according to a senior researcher with the PLA Navy, who asked not to be named, said. 4th quarter growth bucks slowing trend China\\'s economic growth hit the full-year target of 6.7 percent in 2016, with a faster-than-expected rate of 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter, but more proactive efforts may be needed to keep the strong momentum, economists said. The performance in the fourth quarter bucked the trend of decline for the first time in the past two years. Industrial production grew steadily last year, with high-tech industry rising by 10.8 percent year-on-year. The economic structure also improved, with the service sector accounting for 51.6 percent of the total GDP, according to NBS data. Second-child policy increases births by 7.9% The universal second-child policy implemented early last year was a major factor in raising the number of births in China to 17.86 million last year, an increase of 7.9 percent and the highest annual number since since 2000, according to the top health authority. The number of newborns has increased by 1.31 million compared with 2015. The portion of the births to couples who already had at least one child rose quickly to at least 45 percent last year, Yang Wenzhuang, a division director of the National Health and Family Planning Commission, said at a news conference.   - Premier Li Keqiang meets with Scottish-American chemist Sir James Fraser Stoddart, winner of the 2016 Nobel Prize in chemistry, in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

       " ['Gearing up nan As Trump calls on manufacturers to return to the US, what are the prospects for China\\'s industrial strategy? Where next for manufacturing? The geographic location of factories and production has become one of the more hotly debated issues in recent months. At an executive meeting of the Chinese State Council, chaired by Premier Li Keqiang on Dec 28, a guideline was issued to encourage more foreign investment in high-end manufacturing in China. This would underpin the \"Made in China 2025\" strategy for the country to become a global leader in such areas as rail transport, robotics, motorcycles and industrial design within the next decade.    Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has called upon US manufacturers to return their production from China and elsewhere to the United States to create jobs there. Ford has already canceled plans for a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico and will build one in the US instead. Arguably, with labor costs (once the primary driver for offshoring) now a smaller component of overall production costs because of increased automation, manufacturing is becoming increasingly mobile and can be located in developed countries with higher labor costs. In October, Fuyao, the Chinese autoglass maker, opened the world\\'s biggest glass plant in Moraine, Ohio, where labor costs are eight times higher than in China. It wants to get a larger slice of the US market and some believe that this might be part of a trend of Chinese manufacturers playing a role in Trump\\'s so-called jobs revolution. The Chinese government wants its own companies to invest in manufacturing in China, partly to stem the flow of capital out of the country which has a weakening effect on the country\\'s currency. The State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission issued a notice in January saying it was to monitor overseas investment by state-owned companies in certain sectors.    Peter Williamson, professor of international management at Cambridge University\\'s Judge Business School, says China is aiming to build an advanced high-end manufacturing sector which will be a core platform for the overall economy. \"It knows full well it can\\'t build a high-income economy based on low-cost, labor-intensive manufacturing,\" he says \"It needs to build a more high-value industrial base, some of which it will be able to do itself, but some of it will rely on investment by foreign companies.\" Williamson, a leading expert on Chinese innovation, believes China will have little difficulty attracting such investment. \"One of the advantages of the Chinese market is that it is the fastest growing, and in many cases the biggest, market in the world. If you take a company like Apple, almost a quarter of its profits and almost all the growth in its volume came from China.\" Eric Thun, the Peter Moores associate professor in Chinese Business Studies at Oxford University\\'s Said Business School, says that despite progress there are still challenges for China in upgrading its industry. He cites the semi conductor industry, which receives large government subsidies but is still heavily reliant on imported chips - in particular from the US - for its high-end gadgets. \"There are still limitations as to what Chinese semiconductor companies can do,\" says Thun. The American academic, who is an authority on the China automotive sector, says there have been challenges in the past in opening up these new sectors for investment. \"Sometimes it has worked and sometimes it hasn\\'t. There have been these concerns in the international business community over the past couple of years about uncertainty,\" he says. \"There is frustration that the government wants to loosen things up for investment in some areas but makes it difficult for everyone else in others.\" Whether the new US administration succeeds in persuading more of its native companies to base their operations back in their homeland remains to be seen. There is, however, already an established trend for companies moving some of their activities back. According to research by the non-profit organization Reshoring Initiative, some 249,000 jobs were moved back in the five years up to the end of 2015. This was more than the 220,000 that left between 2000 to 2003, seen as the peak period for offshoring globally. He Weiwen, vice-president and senior fellow of the Center for China and Globalization, China\\'s leading independent think tank, believes there is a limit on what can be moved back. He points to US Department of Commerce statistics, which show that the value added per employee for US multinational overseas operations is 29 percent higher than that within the US. \"The only way to bridge that would be for Trump to cut the corporation tax rate from 35 to 20 percent and then impose a 10 percent tariff on goods of these companies coming back into the US. That would still not account for the higher medicare and legal costs involved in employing people in the US,\" he says. \"All this, however, would be a major violation of World Trade Organization rules.\"    He, a former economic and commercial counselor at the Chinese Consulate General in New York and San Francisco, believes it will be a challenge to get US companies to invest more in Chinese manufacturing. \"In my exchanges with American businesses in China, they are not concerned with manufacturing, but getting more access to services, not only financial services like banking and insurance but also legal consulting, leisure and medical services.\" Williamson at Cambridge, who was speaking from Switzerland after attending the Davos forum, says the problem with some of the current debate is that it is couched in terms of manufacturing still being vertically integrated and companies doing everything in one location. He says that model began to die out in the 1990s - driven to a large degree by China - and now the whole production system is built on global supply chains. \"When Donald Trump talks about bringing manufacturing back, what exactly is he talking about? The real question is what bits of this complex global supply chain can be moved and the economics are going to be different depending on which part of the chain you are taking about because some bits are capital-intensive and some labor-intensive.\" \"It would be quite some paradox if the bit that gets moved back to the US is the final assembly operation.\" Fuyao was not the first Chinese manufacturer to set up a production facility in the US. Wanxiang Group, based in Hangzhou, has made a series of acquisitions in the US, including buying bankrupt A123 Systems, a battery maker, for $256 million. Edward Tse, chairman and founder of Gao Feng Advisory, the management consultancy, says a pattern is emerging of Chinese companies doing relatively low-end manufacturing in the US and buying up high-end facilities in Europe. \"We have had a lot of clients come to us looking to make acquisitions in the US, particularly in automotive parts, consumer retail and areas like building materials,\" he says. \"When it comes to areas like high-end manufacturing, they are looking to make acquisitions in Germany, the UK and places like Switzerland and Austria.\" Tse, author of The China Strategy, says this separation has emerged mainly because of US resistance to Chinese technology companies like telecommunications giant Huawei making investments in the US. \"What you are seeing instead is Chinese money in start-up investments in Silicon Valley, Seattle and on the east coast around Boston and Cambridge. They are often part American and part Chinese ventures and because they are small, they are subject to much less scrutiny.\" Jeffrey Towson, professor of investment at Peking University\\'s Guanghua School of Management, says even if there is a major wave of Chinese manufacturing investments in the Rust Belt or major reshoring by US companies, it is unlikely to create the jobs that Trump craves. \"The biggest impact on manufacturing jobs in the US has not been offshoring to Asia or China but the advance of technology,\" he says. \"It is wiping out jobs far faster than offshoring ever did. It is going to be an increasing phenomenon and is not a trend that will reverse itself.\" Thun at Said Business School believes China is following the right strategy in trying to upgrade its manufacturing by partnering with foreign firms. \"This has so far involved acquiring German firms. There is some concern in Germany about losing their crown jewels, particularly the family-owned mittelstadt (small to medium-sized) companies which are often willing to sell out.\" \"For China to be successful in high-end manufacturing, they need to acquire some of these German institutional and educational structures that promote this type of precision engineering. If you can\\'t beat them at their own game, you can always acquire them,\" he says. andrewmoody@chinadaily.com.cn             (China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page1)'],\n",
       " ['Highs and lows of living in paradise nan For Cui Yanbing, the fruit platter on the table of the guest room is an apt metaphor for the existence of those who live on the island of Vommuli, in the central western Maldives, including hers. \"The fruit you see here comes from all over the world,\" she says, pointing to the lemon, plum and passion fruit, none native to the island country. Cui, who goes by her English name Ice, first came to the Maldives in October 2013. \"It was part my own choice, part destiny,\" says the 24-year-old, who was first hired by a photo studio in Dubai in 2012.   Luxury hotel St. Regis at Vommuli Island in the central western Maldives. Photos by Zhao Xu / China Daily; Lin Xiaoli, Wong Chiu Man, Fan Qianyi / For China Daily        \"My job was to try to persuade customers to pay for touristy pictures taken of them with, and sometimes without, their consent. I hated the fact I had to be pushy all the time and asked to leave after a mere six months.\" But it was not as easy as she had thought. The company, which had paid her relocation expenses, wanted its money back. \"There was a second choice - to go to the Maldives.\" So she went. And despite having no experience with a camera, she found herself behind the shutter, snapping pictures for tourists, many of them Chinese. The work continued for some time before Cui landed another job as a receptionist at a luxury hotel. When the St. Regis announced its pre-opening last October, Cui joined the team as the hotel\\'s only Chinese butler. \"In a way, I feel that I\\'ve been carried to the shore of the Maldives, and to Vommuli, by the current of fate.\" Yet it has also been an upstream swim - the position of butler is considered much more challenging and is, of course, higher-paid than that of a receptionist. People come to the Maldives to relax and be free of worries. But for those who are here for a living, the daily problems, from overcoming language barriers to battling loneliness, often teem below the surface. \"My English vocabulary was very limited when I first came,\" Cui says. \"Now I have absolutely no problem communicating with my English-speaking clients and colleagues. The secret? Before, I learned by brain; now I learn by heart.\"  Apart from Cui, the St. Regis Hotel at Vommuli has a guest experience manager and a dive center coach who are also Chinese. The hotel\\'s spa has one masseuse who is Chinese Malaysian, and when I was there in early December, the hotel had also invited a Chinese chef from the St. Regis Shenzhen to work with local chefs on Chinese cuisine with a twist. Xue Rui, the associate director of St. Regis Hotels & Resorts, Greater China, says the hotel management clearly has its high-end Chinese customers in mind. \"It\\'s true that the Maldives, the country of a thousand islands, has myriad choices, and the bulk of Chinese customers still head for middle-priced destinations. However, we believe in the potential the Chinese market holds for luxury travel.\" Fan Qianyi, 37, is the Chinese dive center coach. A former merchandiser bitten by the travel bug, she decided to be a coach not long after she learned diving. Over the past few years, the job has taken her to some of the world\\'s most beautiful beaches, from Thailand and Malaysia to the Maldives. \"The Maldives is different from all the rest, in the sense that the islands are all very separated. The result is a rather encapsulated way of existence that can in some ways wear you down.\" Fan reckons that these days there are about 60 Chinese diving coaches in the Maldives, of whom she knows about 25. \"Since we live on different islands we don\\'t see each other very often.\" Indeed, friendships made in this part of the world are subject to change from the very beginning, as Cui has learned over the past year or so. \"In the Maldives, we usually have one hotel for one island. So a change of job usually involves island hopping,\" says Cui, who shares one bedroom with three of her workmates at the St. Regis. \"When I went to Dubai, 10 girls from the same tourism school went with me. Three of us eventually came here. Now I\\'m the only one who\\'s still here.\" And Fan believes that in the Maldives, the constant sense of fluidity inevitably seeps into relationships that elsewhere would probably have lasted longer. \"Romance does blossom here but is often short-lived. I\\'ve seen as many marriages (often involving a foreign woman and a Maldivian man) end up as divorces. To be frank, the Maldives is probably one of the most open Muslim countries.\" Asked what she does in her spare time, Fan, whose contact with the wind and the sea is burnished on her face, smiles and says: \"Gossip. This is a small place.\" Once every year she spends time with her husband, who introduced her to scuba diving, outside the Maldives. \"He has only come here once, because I need have to go somewhere else.\" The couple plans to migrate to Australia, where Fan can do scuba diving and more. \"For me, the Maldives is a free long holiday; too long, I\\'m afraid.\" For Cui, who has an older brother, the pressure is mounting. \"When I first left China, in April 2013, I promised my parents that I would return within two years, a promise that has been broken.\" She went back to her home in Henan province, central China, and stayed for about three months between May and August last year. Her father underwent a minor operation. \"One thing that\\'s constantly on my mind is my parents\\' medical expenses - they are OK now, but there may come a day when they need costly treatment. I\\'ve seen people left untreated for financial reasons. And I decided that this is not going to happen to my parents.\"  Almost all the money she has earned in the Maldives has gone into her savings account, she says. The monthly income, including salaries and tips, is usually between 7,000 yuan ($1,022.7; 951.3 euros; 822.7) and 10,000 yuan. \"It\\'s easier to save here because you don\\'t have many places to spend on a tiny island. \"I\\'ve asked my parents to come, but they didn\\'t want to, worrying about the cost. When they became aware that here we commute in boats and sea planes instead of buses, they became seriously worried about me.\" With the full knowledge that in a few years she will be back in China - probably her hometown, where a suitable marriage and a stable life awaits - Cui believes that the Maldives has given her much more than better English and darker skin. \"My birthday is in October, so when my last birthday came, I had just joined the St. Regis. I expected nothing, but my work mates and friends gave me the biggest surprise,\" she says, beaming. \"They handmade a birthday cake, sang Happy Birthday to me in Chinese and, in a typical Maldivian way of celebrating a birthday, threw me into the sea. \"This is going to be my last stop in the Maldives.\" When Cui first left China, she was a second-year student at a Beijing occupational school for would-be tour guides. \"To be honest, attending that school was more about paying money for a certificate than about receiving a quality education, so I quit as soon as the right opportunity came up.\" What sounds like a natural choice today must have been a bold move for a 21-year-old who had never been abroad before. The Maldives, despite its soothing calmness, is in fact for dreamers and risk-takers, those who dare to live differently. Fan the diving coach knows all about that. \"For the Maldives, each one of us is merely a passing ship, but as we do so the ocean waves leave their mark. Under Maldives law you\\'re not allowed to take anything away from this country, not even a tiny branch of dead coral. For me, a net full of memories is more than enough.\" zhaoxu@chinadaily.com.cn ( China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page1)'],\n",
       " [\"China could help make America great again nan Instead of opponents, the two nations could be partners assisting the Trump administration in achieving its stated aims On Jan 20, Donald Trump took the oath of office and was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, but his aggressive remarks on economics, trade and geopolitics add more uncertainty - even potential tension - to Sino-US relations. In fact, the two countries are major trading partners and according the research Report on Chinese Enterprises Globalization - published by the Center for China and Globalization, China has become a net capital exporter for the first time. In 2015, China's total direct investment to the US exceeded the FDI amount from the US to China for the first time. Also, China-US bilateral investment has experienced a rapid increase in the past few decades. This astonishing development has resulted in an immense spillover effect for both countries, promoting domestic employment, upgrading technological development and stimulating industrial restructuring. Thus, the two countries should prioritize economic diplomacy and seek more opportunities for collaboration. To make America great again, Trump has promised to bring manufacturing companies back to US, and increase infrastructure investment to create more jobs for unemployed Americans. In this case, China is probably the best partner America can have to help it achieve its ambitions. It is believed that during Trump's administration, policy initiatives will be heavily deployed to revitalize American manufacturing and bring jobs back to the country. Whether Trump will be successful in his attempt to encourage more manufacturing companies to move operations to the US depends not only on re-shoring but also on Chinese manufacturers. These manufacturers might be a solution to Trump's Rust Belt jobs problem. CCG's research shows that, while sectors for China's outbound investment are quite diversified, manufacturing comes out first. And, most importantly, private enterprises have become the main force for outbound investment. More private enterprises have gone up to the high-end of global value chain. Last year, I was invited as a guest to attend Fuyao Glass America's opening ceremony for its newest US facility in Moraine, Ohio. This investment accounts for $450 million, which represents the largest Chinese investment in Ohio and the eighth largest direct foreign investment in the US in the past decade. Currently, this factory employs about 2,000 people and expects to recruit 300-500 people more by the end of 2017. As is planned, this investment will be enlarged to $1 billion and create 5,000 jobs for local people. Fuyao Glass is not the only enterprise that is committed to investing in the US. Cross-border mergers and acquisitions are a growing trend and have become the main focus of Chinese companies' outbound investment. Resources, technology, brands and market channels are the main motivations for cross-border M&A. In January 2016, Chinese home appliance maker Haier Group made a deal to buy General Electric Co's appliance business for $5.4 billion. This month, Jack Ma, Alibaba executive chairman, met Trump and laid out the Chinese e-commerce giant's new plan that could create 1 million jobs for small US businesses over the next five years. Another way for Trump to create more jobs is through an infrastructure revamp. This is a chance for China to play a role, since it has a great deal of experience in infrastructure construction. China can also invite the US to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. China can work with the US to foster a stronger and wider collaboration in infrastructure construction, involving the US, including by jointly exploring markets in other countries. The Chinese government recently announced a series of reforms to improve the overall investment climate, including both market access and regulation, which inevitably compete with Trump's initiatives for attracting investment. The two countries still have a great potential for collaboration, and China seems the best choice as a partner to help the US become a great power again.

       " ['Mexico\\'s losses could be China\\'s gains nan Trump\\'s recent pronouncements about auto imports and NAFTA may knock out nation\\'s biggest competition When it comes to the United States market, Chinese and Mexican manufacturers have long been rivals. Both groups export fairly similar types of goods. Both have advantages in lower labor costs. And they are now the No 1 and No 2 exporters to the US. In most sectors, whether it is toys or laptops, Chinese manufacturers have become dominant. However, in a few key sectors, most notably cars and autoparts, Mexican manufacturers have been more successful, and most frequently because of the North American Free Trade Agreement. That is why US President Donald Trump\\'s statements about wanting to renegotiate or dismantle NAFTA and US-Mexico trade are so important. This could be very bad for Mexican manufacturers but possibly quite good for China. Either way, it looks like it will change the existing dynamic. My argument for this is three points: Point 1: In the US market, Chinese manufacturers have consistently beaten Mexican manufacturers. The types of exports coming from China and Mexico are fairly similar. In 2015, electronic equipment was 26 percent of China\\'s exports (about $600 billion) and 21 percent of Mexico\\'s (about $81 billion). Machines, engines and pumps were 16 percent of China\\'s ($364 billion) and 16 percent of Mexico\\'s ($59 billion). The other major categories such as furniture, lighting, signs; plastics; and medical and technical equipment are also similar between the two countries. The biggest differences you see between Chinese and Mexican exports are in oil and vehicles. And what is most noticeable is that China\\'s exports in almost all of these sectors now dwarf Mexico\\'s. This was not the case 15 years ago. In 2000, Mexico was already six years into the enactment of NAFTA but China had yet to join the World Trade Organization. According to the US Census Bureau, Mexico\\'s exports to the US totaled $136 billion in 2000. At the same time, China\\'s exports to the US were $100 billion. Yet by 2010, China\\'s exports to the US had soared to $365 billion, far surpassing Mexico at $230 billion. Also during 2000 to 2006, Mexico\\'s export growth rate fell to 6 percent, from its previous 15 percent during 1995-2000 and prior to China joining the WTO. In 2016, China\\'s exports to the US reached $423 billion, compared with $271 billion from Mexico. One can certainly argue that Mexico was actually increasing in overall exports to the US during this period. China was just doing better. However, the quote that comes to mind is by Warren Buffett\\'s partner Charlie Munger, who said: \"At Berkshire Hathaway, we do not like to compete against Chinese manufacturers.\" Mexican manufacturers probably now say the same thing. Point 2: A big exception to this trend is in cars and autoparts, where Mexican manufacturers have done consistently better. The biggest exception to this China and Mexico export story is in vehicles and autoparts. In 2016, Mexican global exports in this sector reached $90 billion, making it the country\\'s single largest export at 23.7 percent. And the US was the primary destination for a rapidly growing autoparts-automotive industry. In contrast, China\\'s global exports in this space represented only 2.7 percent of their exports, and totalled $62.7 billion. The reasons for this are, unsurprisingly, NAFTA and Mexico\\'s close proximity to the US. It is simply much cheaper to transport cars and other heavy items from Mexico to the US and most final car assembly is done close to market. However, autoparts have less of a geographic factor and there is fairly complicated movement of parts, components and various stages of assembly across Mexico, America and Canada. NAFTA is the other factor, which has removed most trade and investment barriers between the US, Canada and Mexico. Virtually all of the major automakers have now centralized some or all of their production for North America to Mexico. Today, the importance of the automobile-auto parts industry to Mexico cannot be overstated. It is the country\\'s single biggest export and source of dollars (now surpassing money sent home by migrants to the US). Mexican car production has reached record numbers with more than 3 million cars produced each year. Automobile-autoparts are also one of the biggest drivers for foreign investment into the country. Since 2010, nine of the major automakers have announced more than $24 billion in investments in Mexico, with most targeting the US as their primary end-market. Point 3: US President Trump may now be changing NAFTA and the rules of US-Mexican trade. This could be very good for Chinese manufacturers. US President Trump\\'s recent announcements of an intended renegotiation or cancellation of NAFTA have sent shockwaves through Mexico. More than 70-80 percent of all Mexican exports are going to the US and Canada (i.e., the NAFTA members). And what\\'s worse, Trump has specifically focused on Mexican produced automobiles and auto parts, one of the most rapidly growing areas of Mexican manufacturing. Trump has specifically called for a 35 percent tax on cars imported from Mexico. Trump has also already criticized Ford, General Motors and Toyota for moving facilities to Mexico and has stated they will have to pay this 35 percent tax to bring their cars into the US. Ford had the unfortunate luck of announcing an end to all of their US production of small cars in the middle of the election, which got a response from candidate Trump. Ford have now canceled their planned $1.6 billion plant in Mexico. Without question, the potential for upcoming changes to NAFTA and car imports is already having a chilling effect on investment into Mexico. However, for Chinese manufacturers this could be a positive development. For them, this looks like their biggest competitor for exports to the US may be about to lose its biggest advantage, a largely tariff-free border. Plus, Mexican exports to the US are heavily weighted to automobile-auto parts, the area Trump is focusing most on. For China, broad changes to NAFTA could result in a leveling of the playing field in certain sectors in terms of tariffs. It is also worth noting that Chinese manufacturers have already been catching up with Mexican manufacturers in automobile-auto parts, just as they have in most other industries. In 2014, China passed Canada and became the second-largest exporter of automotive parts into the US after Mexico. Even before the recent comments, Mexican manufacturers were worried that China might be granted a lower tariff. Ultimately, there are a lot factors in each sub-sector when it comes to trade, whether its tariffs, shipping costs, changing currencies or others. So it\\'s difficult to generalize too much when it comes to Mexico and Chinese manufacturers. However, we can conclude that Trump\\'s recent pronouncements about auto imports and NAFTA are much worse for Mexico than China. And they raise a very intriguing question: Without NAFTA, can Mexican manufacturers successfully compete with China? The author is the professor of investment, Guanghua School of Management.

       " ['Returning to the US? It\\'s a non-starter nan Taking some operations back to their roots wouldn\\'t make any sense at all, says expert Paul Ni believes it will be almost impossible for US companies to move their operations back to the United States to create jobs at home. The 34-year-old principal for management consultants Roland Berger says there is no logic for companies that have major operations in Asia, and in particular China, to do that. US President Donald Trump has called for American companies to bring their manufacturing operations home.    \"You have, on the one hand, what he wants to come back to the US and on the other hand, the reality of what can actually come back,\" says Ni. So far, only US companies in Mexico have said they are moving some of their operations back. General Motors has announced it is moving 450 jobs back. Ford has axed plans for a $1.6 billion plant in the US-neighboring country, which industry sources claim was never going to get the final go-ahead anyway. Ni, speaking at his company\\'s offices in Gateway Plaza, Beijing, says it would be highly damaging for some of his clients to up sticks from China and move back to the US. He highlights the US chemicals company Cabot, which has been in China for 30 years and set up a joint venture with Hengyecheng in Wuhai in Inner Mongolia in September last year to make silica. The new investment will create many thousands of jobs. \"It has done a considerable amount of work on that project, including building a strong relationship with the local government. Why would it have to close that plant and rebuild another one in the US? It would just be illogical.\" He says Cabot, which has other hubs in Tianjin and Shanghai, is a prime example of a modern US multinational company, with 80 percent of its revenues coming from overseas. \"Its growth is driven by Asia, primarily by China. The American market is not really a growth area for the company.\" Ni believes Chinese autoglass maker Fuyao\\'s decision to set up an operation in Moraine, Ohio, in October was driven by very specific factors. The Volkswagen scandal relating to disguising emission levels is set to boost sales of US cars and therefore autoglass. Fuyao already has a 60 percent share of the China market and needs to find markets outside the country. \"The economic advantages relate to energy costs, such as natural gas, being between a third and half the price they are in China. They are getting the land almost free. The labor costs, however, are almost eight times those of China.\" Ni argues it is not just the cost of labor that is likely to stop a flood of China manufacturers switching operations to the US, but also the lack of skills now available. Cao Dewang, founder and chairman of Fuayo, has admitted that he has had to employ mainly people over the age of 50. \"He can hardly find any young working adults suitable for such blue collar jobs. This is because the industrial landscape has changed and is now very much service-orientated rather than production-orientated so there aren\\'t the young people with these skills anymore.\" Ni also cannot envisage Trump getting the steel mills in Pittsburgh rolling again, with the Pennsylvanian city now more noted for its robotics industry. \"We no longer talk about American companies in the steel sector, to be honest. It is either Japanese, Chinese or European ones in high-end steel production.\" Ni, who was born in Harbin but moved to Singapore as a teenager, studied electrical engineering at the National University of Singapore before doing his master\\'s at MIT in the US. He began his career in investment banking with Credit Suisse in Singapore before going to study for an MBA at INSEAD in Fontainebleau, France. He joined Roland Berger - one of the few international management consultancy firms that has developed out of Europe, rather than the US - in 2011 and now works for a wide range of clients in industrial goods, packaging, steel, utilities and energy. Ni believes that instead of manufacturing migrating out of China, it is now more likely to remain at home, given the current emphasis on developing a high-end manufacturing sector. The State Council issued a guideline in December aimed at attracting more foreign investment in manufacturing. \"In China you have access to a more talented, highly skilled and comparatively cheaper labor force. China has transformed from low-cost production to a technologically-driven and technically intensive economy. The Government has achieved this by investing heavily in research and development,\" he says. Ni believes there is now a major opportunity for early stage European start-up companies, in particular, to come to China to develop their products. \"This does not just apply in manufacturing, but more generally. There is just a bigger market to test any concept with. In the past, companies might have tested their products in Sweden and the Nordic region, with access to 20 million people, before taking them to Western Europe. In China, they can do this on a much bigger scale.\" The consultant says that any reservations companies may have had in the past about intellectual property protection are no longer as relevant. \"They can come to China earlier and patent their product and then continue to upgrade it to make sure the application is not being copied later on.\" Ni thinks some of China\\'s low-end manufacturing will continue to move to South East Asian destinations like Thailand, Vietnam and Laos but believes it will be at least another generation before it moves to Africa. \"In Africa, you have mining and some consumer-related enterprises but you don\\'t have a fully established industry-related infrastructure. You have the production of shoes and apparel but no more than that,\" he says. \"I would be confident that in 10 to 20 years you will see an automotive hub there.\" Ni believes the real activity, however, will be in China, which is now building many advantages over the US. \"China has everything the US can offer to develop high-end industrial activity. There is a big market, which is potentially more dynamic. Even in areas like technology, you have major successes such as Didi (the China taxi-hailing service), which has now merged its operations with Uber,\" he says. andrewmoody@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/27/2017 page7)'],\n",

The product is said to meet the growing need for animal protein driven by fast-growing demand for meat in China. Jean-Marc Dublanc, CEO of Bluestar Adisseo Company, says the fast-growing demand for safe and nutritious food, plus fluctuating prices of animal feed products, including wheat and corn, are requiring animal nutrition solution providers to offer products with higher efficiency, safety and quality. Adisseo is the world\\'s second-largest provider of methionine, with a market share of 27 percent. The company went public in Shanghai in 2015, the first European company to be listed on the A-share market. Its plant in Nanjing, in East China\\'s Jiangsu province, is one of the group\\'s largest facilities globally. About 47 percent of products produced in the plant are exported to other countries. China is currently Adisseo\\'s largest market by sales revenue. \"We aim to offer high added-value services to help our clients gain precise animal nutrition solutions. Our consultancy-based analysis helps clients understand their specific needs and get customized feeding solutions for animal nutrition,\" said Dublanc. In this way, clients can reduce and better control their costs, and use animal nutrition products safely and correctly. This also helps to secure the safety of the entire food supply chain. Products such as probiotics can be used to replace some antibiotics. This may help reduce overuse of antibiotics in animal feeding and cut the risk of harm to end consumers, says Dublanc. Adisseo is also open to growth opportunities outside organic growth, such as strategic mergers or acquisitions, technology alliances and partnerships in China and globally, says Dublanc. The compound annual growth rate of global market demand for methionine has been about 6 percent since 2013. China\\'s market demand is growing faster, at 7 to 10 percent, according to data from FoodInfo, an information services provider focusing on the food industry. China\\'s demands for meat protein have risen more than 50 percent in the past 10 years, and annual demand for animal feed is about 600 million metric tons, pushing up demand for animal nutrition products, according to research from the China Animal Feeding Information Network. wuyiyao@chinadail.com.cn    (China Daily European Weekly 01/20/2017 page29)'],\n",

       " ['SinoFortone aims to be household name in UK nan Chinese now look beyond pure financial returns in efforts to move up value-added ladder SinoFortone may not yet be household name in the UK, but the company is committing billions of pounds of investment in crucial UK infrastructure projects with a clear strategy of using the foothold to grab opportunities in Europe and along the route of China\\'s Belt and Road Initiative. SinoFortone first made a name for itself in the UK during President Xi Jinping\\'s 2015 state visit by announcing an investment of 2 billion ($2.5 billion; 2.3 billion euros) in two biomass power stations in Wales, and 100 million in London\\'s new Paramount entertainment park. Since then, it has signed a deal with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to lead a Chinese consortium to invest 10 billion in Scotland\\'s infrastructure.   - SinoFortone has invested in a renewable power plant in Anglesey, Wales. Provided to China Daily  \"We are confident about the UK\\'s investment opportunities despite short-term Brexit uncertainties,\" says Peter Zhang, chief executive of SinoFortone. \"In the UK we would focus our investment strategy on renewable energy projects and social housing, as those sectors require more investment, provide desirable revenue return and have turnaround time periods that suit our investment agenda.\" Although returns on infrastructure projects vary, Zhang says on average they can generate about 8 percent return on capital, which is not high compared with projects in emerging markets. \"Instead of looking for immediate financial returns, we are more concerned with building our reputation in the UK, gaining experience in this mature market and using our UK resources and enhanced brand image to grow into other international markets,\" Zhang says. Sinofortone is a joint venture between Sinolinks Group and Liaoning Fortone Group. Liaoning Fortone is a private construction business in Shenyang that focuses on investment in large-scale projects and becoming a construction partner in those projects. Sinolinks is a Chinese company focusing on asset and fund management, commodity trading and mining. Capital is one advantage it has in the UK\\'s current infrastructure and housing investment market. Its ability to source cost-effective materials in the supply chain from China is another core advantage. The UK\\'s public sector strain on infrastructure capital has been exacerbated by the British public\\'s vote to leave the European Union in June 2016, meaning the UK may no longer be eligible for valuable European infrastructure funds.    The UK may lose eligibility for the so-called Juncker Plan, which aims to unlock 315 billion euros ($334 billion; 270 billion) of infrastructure investment between 2015 and 2017. Currently, the plan includes eight major UK projects worth a total of 8.2 billion euros, which could create more than 70,000 jobs. Whether the funding continues will depend on the UK-EU exit negotiations. In that context, the British government is eager to attract Chinese funds. During the eighth Economic and Finance Dialogue in London in November, it showcased 13 projects offering more than 5 billion in investment opportunities to Chinese investors. Concerns emerged after China General Nuclear finally inked its agreement to invest in the UK\\'s Hinkley Nuclear power station in October and the new British government led by Prime Minister Theresa May announced new rules for scrutinizing foreign investment in infrastructure projects that involve national security, but Zhang is not worried. \"Our investment mostly focuses on renewable energy, like wind, solar, waste-to-energy and biomass, which have no national security concerns, unlike nuclear,\" Zhang says. In addition to capital investment, SinoFortone also helps European projects become more cost effective through sourcing equipment from China, which could cut material costs 30 to 50 percent, Zhang says. The two biomass power stations will generate up to 299 megawatts of power each, and will be built using technology from British partner Orthios Eco Parks, which developed the innovative technology to create electricity from plants. So far in 2016 Orthios and Zhang\\'s team have raised 30 million in the UK from bond issuance, which is already invested in the initial phases of the power station.    Currently, factory construction does not have a timeline, as it is waiting for the UK government\\'s Contract for Difference auction - an energy subsidy allocation process, which was delayed by the Brexit vote from 2016 to spring 2017. It is a standard process wherein the government subsidizes the price difference between what consumers pay and what power companies charge to make their investment profitable. \"Once we start construction, the power station can become operational in two years,\" Zhang says. Construction for the second biomass power station in Wales, in Port Talbot, will begin once the Anglesey power plant is complete. Despite the Anglesey delay, SinoFortone\\'s involvement in renewable energy has secured it opportunities to negotiate deals with various governments for infrastructure investment, including Kazakhstan, Greece, Georgia, Angola, Guinea and Pakistan. \"Securing the UK renewable energy deals helped us establish a good reputation and greatly helped push forward those deals in Africa and in the Belt and Road countries, where we could also play a role in bringing advanced UK technology,\" Zhang says. SinoFortone\\'s investment in the two biomass plants is welcomed by Orthios, though the fact that the technology was unproven in the market had made fundraising difficult. Orthios was founded over a decade ago by Sean McCormick, an architect, and Lewis LeVasseur, an engineer. Orthios had already secured planning permission and relevant approvals before SinoFortone joined the project. \"We have spent five years researching and developing this model, and the investment from China will help us roll it out across the planet,\" says McCormick, chief executive of Orthios. China\\'s focus on green energy and its ability to take a long-term view was instrumental in securing the deal, McCormick says, adding that the two biomass plants combined will create 1,000 full-time jobs, as well as thousands of jobs during the construction phase. Industry analysts see the collaboration as a win-win for both the Chinese and British sides. Danae Kyriakopoulou, head of research at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a London-based think tank, says SinoFortone\\'s investment in Wales is an important example of how China is increasingly using its resources to invest in high-innovation, knowledge-driven economies. \"Appropriately for an economy in the phase of industrialization, China has traditionally focused its investment on resource-rich economies that have in exchange provided it with the raw materials it needed to fuel its development,\" Kyriakopoulou says. \"However, China is now looking beyond the purely financial returns on investment as it seeks to move up the ladder in the global chain of value-added.\" In March, SinoFortone led a Chinese consortium to sign an agreement with the Scottish government to invest 10 billion in Scotland\\'s infrastructure, covering projects in transportation, power stations and social housing. China Railway No 3 Engineering Group is also part of the consortium and is expected to provide technical support. \"We saw market demand in Scotland for those new infrastructure projects, so we wanted to help the Scottish government fulfill those demands,\" Zhang says. \"Our advantage in engaging with those projects is our capital investment and our ability to bring Chinese elements.\" One example of Chinese construction techniques to be deployed in Scotland is prefabricated modular housing, which could be 30 percent more cost effective than on-site construction. In addition to infrastructure projects, SinoFortone is also increasingly engaging with the UK\\'s tourism market, riding an increasing number of Chinese visitors. In December it purchased The Plough at Cadsden, the pub in rural Buckinghamshire where then-prime minister David Cameron treated President Xi Jinping to fish and chips and a pint of beer in 2015. cecily.liu@mail.chinadailyuk.com (China Daily European Weekly 01/20/2017 page30)'],\n",
       " ['New faces in banking nan Regulator\\'s liberalization, innovation by non-State enterprises are making financial services inclusive Ten years ago, Peng Jindong, then 21, set up a small e-store called Mmaicco to sell street-dance wear on Taobao, China\\'s largest online marketplace operated by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Peng was then based in Zhengzhou, Henan province. Little did he realize that financial innovation, brought about by the liberalization of financial services and the advent of new Chinese private sector banks in offline and online channels, would help him to expand his business to men\\'s and women\\'s clothing. Peng\\'s business expansion in subsequent years was a result of online shopping giant Alibaba\\'s 2010 decision to offer easy loans to merchants on Taobao. As one of the first group of traders who received loans, he borrowed 5,000 yuan ($719; 677 euros; 596) with sales orders for collateral. Later, he relocated to Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, rented a 140 square meter apartment and hired a few hands to run the business. Again, it was Alibaba\\'s loan that made it possible. This time round, the loan was much bigger: 100,000 yuan. When Ant Financial, an Alibaba subsidiary, launched an online private bank called MYbank in 2015, Peng received a credit quota of 1 million yuan. Based on his previous record, he did not have to pledge anything or offer any collateral to MYbank. That emboldened him to become ambitious. He wanted to launch his own clothing brand, outgrowing the sales-only phase of his business. So he spoke to a loan officer of MYbank about a possible bigger loan. MYbank assessed risks using big data analysis and decided to increase his credit limit to 2 million yuan. That helped Peng to contract a small clothing factory, hire five fashion designers and more than 10 employees. He also rented a 1,000-square-meter office and a warehouse of the same size in Hangzhou. \"Our company is still very small. But, just like Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, I also want to run a business for 102 years,\" he says. He adds: \"And do a lot of things\". He already owns a clothing brand and will open an offline store next. Peng\\'s success is as much a tribute to his can-do spirit as it is a shining example of MYbank\\'s effectiveness in China\\'s liberalized banking industry. As an online bank (with no offline branches), it relies on internet technologies like big data and cloud computing to make lending decisions, and assess and manage risks. It has positioned itself as a specialist in all things small - that is, its deposits, loans and customers (mainly self-owned businesses, farmers and startups founded by college students in rural areas) are all small. By the end of November, MYbank had served more than 2 million micro and small enterprises, lending each 15,000 yuan on average. Its loan balance was 25.4 billion yuan, up 243 percent from the beginning of last year. Starting in June 2016, it also began offering micro and small business owners a free online product that analyzes financial data of their business thoroughly. This means, they no longer have to make rough calculations of their profits or losses. Currently, 500,000 micro and small enterprises are benefitting from the product. That is all in stark contrast to the past. This change in China\\'s financial services sector began with the launch of a trial program in 2014 to set up the first five private banks, including MYbank. The China Banking Regulatory Commission has gradually accelerated approvals for the establishment of such banks. As of Jan 10, the CBRC has approved 17 private banks. Seven of them have opened for business already. Among the new kids on the banking block are Beijing\\'s Zhongguancun Bank, named after the area where it is located, also known as China\\'s \"Silicon Valley\"; and Jiangsu Suning Bank Co Ltd, founded by electronics retailer Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd and a few other companies in Jiangsu province. At a news conference on Dec 8, Ling Gan, director of the CBRC\\'s City Commercial Banks Supervision Department, said the regulator will continue to push forward the orderly establishment of private banks, as long as the applications for banking licenses meet regulatory requirements and the founders are well prepared. \"The first five private banks tried to innovate their models of development and bolster weak spots in the traditional financial sector. They are trying to provide more targeted and more convenient financial services to communities, startup companies, as well as micro, small and medium-sized enterprises,\" Ling said. The CBRC requires private banks to choose a clear market position and make different business strategies from existing banks\\', based on regional economic factors and their shareholders\\' resources. The big idea is to modernize the banking system. So, the first five private banks have been reaching out to micro and small businesses or individuals in relatively low-income groups that were neglected by traditional banks. Some of the new banks played to their strengths in e-commerce, social networking or big data, while others exploited their geographical and local policy advantages. For instance, WeBank, an online bank founded by internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd, launched personal loans ranging from 500 yuan to 300,000 yuan, without asking for any collateral or guarantee. In addition to the consumer credit report provided by China\\'s central bank, WeBank says it mines information from social networking patterns and online transactions of loan applicants through multipurpose apps WeChat and QQ, which belong to the Tencent stable. In late November, WeBank\\'s small consumer-loans served more than 60 million people in 549 cities in China, most of whom were not clients of traditional banks. WeBank data found that 65 percent of the borrowers were aged 25 to 35; 75 percent of them were male; and the top five industries where they worked were manufacturing, technology, trading, public services and financial services. WeBank\\'s total collateral-free small consumer-loans exceeded 160 billion yuan, with bad loans less than 1 percent, lower than the 1.81 percent average of commercial banks. It is not as if private banks are making runaway progress as regulatory prudence in China tends to be conservative, says Wu Qing, director of the comprehensive research office of the Research Institute of Finance under the Development Research Center of the State Council. jiangxueqing@chinadaily.com.cn    (China Daily European Weekly 01/20/2017 page26)'],\n",
       " ['Dependence on foreign oil up nan Level for last year reflects high local output costs, low global crude price China\\'s foreign oil dependency level reached 64.4 percent of total demand in 2016, 3.8 percent higher than the previous year, and was expected to rise again in 2017, a leading economics think tank in China said on Jan 12. The mainland\\'s domestic crude production dropped to 200 million metric tons in 2016 due to high production costs of domestic crude oil at an average of $45-50 (47-42 euros; 36-40) per barrel, higher than the global average, according to the CNPC Economics and Technology Research Institute. Under such circumstances, imported oil was more cost-effective, it said. An analyst said the world\\'s second-biggest crude oil consumer, to make up for the decline of domestic oil output, will continue the trend to import crude oil from abroad and the dependence on foreign oil was likely to climb further. Li Li, an energy research director at ICIS China, says the country\\'s foreign oil dependency level might increase to 70 percent by 2020.    \"With the declining global crude oil prices, the country\\'s major oil giants have all lowered their domestic production and investment, which will lead to a further decrease of domestic crude production,\" says Li. The latest official data indicates that 2016 output of China\\'s two largest oilfields, Daqing in Heilongjiang province and Shengli in Shandong province, fell by over 5 million tons compared with 2015. Daqing posted crude oil production of 36.56 million tons and Shengli 23.9 million tons, for decreases of 1.826 million and 3.2 million tons, respectively, compared with 2015. That number is expected to further drop in 2017. With no discoveries in recent years, there are concerns that the output reduction of the two major oilfields will lead to a further decline of the country\\'s domestic crude oil production, the analyst says. However, Li says the agency forecast a slight increase of domestic crude oil production in 2017 following a rebalancing of the global crude oil price. Li says OPEC\\'s long-sought agreement to reduce production by 1.2 million barrels a day is seen as bringing equilibrium back to demand and supply. According to the CNPC Economics and Technology Research Institute, the country\\'s total energy consumption reached around 4.36 billion tons of coal equivalent in 2016, a year-on-year increase of 1.4 percent. The world\\'s biggest consumer of energy plans to cap total primary energy consumption at around 4.4 billion tons of coal equivalent in 2017, with a further push to use cleaner fuel, according to the National Energy Administration. China\\'s refined oil consumption reached 313 million tons last year, a 1 percent decrease compared with the same period last year and the first time the refined fuel sector saw a downward trend, it says. zhengxin@chinadaily.com.cn    (China Daily European Weekly 01/20/2017 page27)'],\n",

Kui Weiliang, deputy director of the China Ningbo Stationery Association in Ningbo, East China\\'s Zhejiang province, home to one of the leading Chinese stationery enterprises, Beifa Group, says: \"The average cost of producing a ballpoint pen is about 0.5 yuan (7 cents). The head costs more than 0.1 yuan, which could be decreased to a maximum of 0.05 yuan when the homemade stainless steel products replace imported ones. When it (specialty steel) is mass produced, customers will be able to buy high-quality pens at a lower price.\" However, Zhao Dongmin, who has run the M&G Chenguang Stationery store in Chaoyang district, Beijing, for about five years, says the price of ballpoint pens would not be affected. \"I don\\'t think the buying and selling price will change,\" Zhao says.  \"The cost saved on materials is likely to be offset by the increasing production and logistical expenses.\" In his store, varieties of ballpoint pens are on display. Prices ranges from 1 to 4.5 yuan. \"Generally, customers tend to pay 2 or 3 yuan for a ballpoint pen. For items as cheap as ballpoint pens, few people will care whether the pen is made in China or not. But the difference in quality will be noticed,\" Zhao says. Since Taiyuan Iron & Steel Co declared its intention to develop the first homegrown stainless steel unit for use in the production of ballpoint pen heads in early January, the topic has garnered more than 7.5 million page views on Sina Weibo, a Twitter-like social media platform in China. \"The production process for a ballpoint pen head is as complicated as that of a watch. I\\'m proud China is the sixth country to succeed in doing it,\" messaged one neitzen.

And it should be matched perfectly with the ball seat to let the ink flow from the gap between.\" Fu says that since the tiny head requires high-precision stainless steel and high-end equipment, China had been importing them from Japan and Switzerland for many years, causing the high production cost.

       " ['Share prices of SOEs expected to \\'bounce back\\' nan Restructuring and recombining promises to grow profits in steel, coal The share prices of China\\'s giant state-owned enterprises in the steel, coal and power sectors are expected to rebound this year as the country recombines resources to create more Fortune Global 500 companies to compete with foreign rivals, an expert said on Jan 16. The opportunity came after the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission said recently that the SOE reform will no longer focus only on cutting the number of groups or their subsidiaries. Industrial upgrading, global market diversification and resource optimization are main focus of the reform this year. Listed companies such as Hunan Valin Steel Co, Jizhong Energy Group Co, Beijing-based Huaneng Power International Inc, Shanghai Electric Power Co and another 10 companies from these three industries all announced that they have been involved in asset reorganization since 2016. He Jingtong, a professor of economics at Nankai University in Tianjin, says that because the steel, coal and power businesses can notably affect SOE profits, the government is keen to integrate these commodity-based sectors to support profit growth, as international commodity prices are gradually picking up.    \"The changing relationship between supply and demand of China\\'s manufacturing products, the stable business operations of the steel and coal industries, and the central government\\'s call to cut excessive industrial capacity are all core factors pushing reform in these three industries,\" says Li Jin, a researcher at the Beijing-based China Enterprise Research Institute. The SASAC has set a target to raise the profit growth rate gained by central SOEs to between 3 percent and 6 percent year-on-year in 2017. The sales revenue of central SOEs reached 23.4 trillion yuan ($3.39 trillion) in 2016, up 2.6 percent year-on-year, while they gained 1.23 trillion yuan in profits, increasing 0.5 percent from the previous year, according to the National Business Daily. China has, to date, cut the number of its central SOEs to 102. Local SOE watchdogs in 10 municipalities and provinces including Beijing, Chongqing and Guangdong, have already made plans to further recombine or cut the number of SOEs this year. China has 150,000 SOEs at different levels, which manage more than 100 trillion yuan ($14.5 trillion; 13.6 trillion euros; 11.8 trillion) in assets and employ more than 30 million people. zhongnan@chinadaily.com.cn    (China Daily European Weekly 01/20/2017 page28)'],\n",
       " ['Payment agencies told to bank clients\\' cash nan Latest step in third-party platforms\\' regulation aims to tackle rising cases of embezzlement amid rapid growth China\\'s central bank, or PBOC, said on Jan 13 that it will eventually ban all non-bank payment agencies, including Alipay, from using clients\\' money. As a first step, it will require all platforms to deposit 20 percent of clients\\' funds in appointed bank accounts. The move is the latest step to be taken by the central bank to tackle the financial risks caused by a rising number of institutions found embezzling money. Starting from April 17, a total of 267 third-party organizations with central bank licenses in China, including Alibaba-owned Alipay, will have to submit around 20 percent of provisions to a single account opened in a commercial bank, with the central bank\\'s approval. Customer provisions refer to money held by third-party organizations that is not the property of the organization. The exact amount handed in by each institution will be calculated based upon the daily average balance of provisions in the previous quarter and will be adjusted quarterly thereafter. \"The 20 percent level aims to leave time for institutions to adapt to new rules,\" says Xie Zhong, head of the central bank\\'s payment and settlement department. \"The final level will be 100 percent\", meaning the central bank will then be the only authority governing provisions. Xie did not provide a specific timeline for adjusting the level.    The move comes after the central bank decided to establish a clearinghouse for online transactions early last year, aiming to trim financial risks by disconnecting the direct clearing business from third-party payment firms and banks. The clearinghouse, which can be used as an alternative to commercial banks to keep custody of provisions, will be launched in March this year, according to Xie. Li Aijun, a law professor with the China University of Political Science and Law, says the new rules will not have a major impact on the income level of the companies. \"The new rules will hit small institutions that are more vulnerable to financial risks,\" she says. Li says she believes it will not take long for the central bank to increase the level to 100 percent, since risks have emerged quickly in recent years in the ever-expanding market. The third-party online payment market in China attained a total transaction value of 4.65 trillion yuan ($674 billion; 630 billion euros; 546 billion) in the second quarter of 2016, up 6.5 percent quarter-to-quarter according to the latest data from Analysis International. A total of 460 billion yuan of customer provisions has been reserved by third-party institutions as of the third quarter of last year, according to the central bank. By the end of last year, more than 30 third-party institutions were fined for illegally embezzling provisions, data from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences show.

When he landed the job of CEO of Dutch dairy producer Royal FrieslandCampina, one of the world\\'s five largest dairy companies, he refreshed its strategies and changed it to be a more purpose-driven company. \"Dutch people drink a lot of milk by nature and they have a love for milk. It has been part of their daily lives for many years and we don\\'t know what life would be without milk,\" he says. \"I joined FrieslandCampina because of what I learned from my previous work. I believed I could help the company to go to a different level. Working for the stakeholders, in this case farmers, is something I appreciate,\" he says.   Roelof Joosten, CEO of Dutch dairy producer Royal FrieslandCampina, says the company primarily focuses on the infant formula market in China. Provided to China Daily  Recently, he spoke to China Daily about the company\\'s e-commerce expansion plans in China and emerging opportunities in smaller Chinese cities. The following are the edited excerpts of the interview. Do you have any plans to expand in China in the next few years? We obviously want to expand further into infant formula, but we also would like to enlarge the other categories, predominantly food service, cheese and ultra-heat treatment milk. We would like to put more effort into those three categories and diversify our business, but at this time, the most important category to play with is infant formula and we should not lose focus. What are your competitive advantages over other international and Chinese brands? FrieslandCampina is not in the game of volumes, but into value creation. In China, we primarily focus on infant formula, because we believe that we can create a lot of value there in how we control our quality and the safety of our product line. We are one of the few producers who control the full dairy chain, so it\\'s from grass to glass. Do you mainly target high-income consumers? Overall, we target consumers with higher incomes. For Friso (the company\\'s high-end infant and toddler formula brand), we still focus on first and second-tier cities in terms of distribution and we can still do a better job on that. For Friso, we can go deeper and wider into the Chinese market and use e-commerce to reach out to other consumers. For example, our cooperation with Suning Commerce Group Co helps us to reach out to those consumers in some third to sixth-tier cities where we don\\'t have any distribution. In these cities, we also target higher income consumers. In the future, we might reach out to the rural areas.  What\\'s your growth potential like with the two-child policy in China? The regulatory change has had quite an impact on local producers as well as international producers. With stricter rules, the unprofessional players who take advantage of the opportunities in China have to leave the market. That means there will be a lot of infant formula dumping in 2017, which will distort the market somewhat. I think the market will recover from that in 2018, when the second-child policy kicks in to have an impact on the market. So I believe 2018 will be a year of full recovery and growth - and in the years to come as well. Do you plan to increase your R&D efforts in China? At the moment, we are building a food services lab in Shanghai to support food service activities in China. We have research centers in Wageningens in the Netherlands and in Singapore. They are the focus centers for infant formula. We have no plan yet to build a research lab in China, but it might still be a possibility in the future. Do infant formula products popular in Asia have any flavor difference from those in Western markets? The recipes in China are slightly different from what we have in Europe. There is a little bit of difference in the composition, such as in content of protein and lactose, as the requirements in China GB standards are different from Europe. From the quality and food safety perspective, there is no difference. Why do you like to work for consumer companies? The good thing is that you can see your own product and experience your product, compare with competitors\\' and bring your product to life. It makes it more interesting if you work for a company like FrieslandCampina because you work for the farmers. FrieslandCampina is owned by farmers. It\\'s a cooperative, so we know our shareholders. We aim to provide better nutrition the generations to come and a good living for our farmers. What\\'s your management style like? I try to assemble people around me, most of them are much better than I am myself, and I give them a lot of responsibilities. In my previous jobs, I hated it when the general manager looked over my shoulder. You have to give them freedom to work and trust them. That\\'s what I\\'m trying to apply at my work. I think that getting high-caliber people, people who deserve trust, and then giving them freedom is important, so I can focus on the primary tasks of a CEO, which are employee management and looking at the general direction and sustainability. I\\'m a down-to-earth boss. I was born in the northern part of the Netherlands, and there is a saying says that \"you should never forget where you come from. Another saying says that \"it could always be worse\", which keeps people humble. How do you spend your weekend? When I\\'m not traveling on business trips, I try to spend time with my family. Earlier I traveled with my wife to the southern part of Argentina. It was a trip that I wanted to do for a long time. It was a very interesting and almost spiritual experience. For the rest of my time on weekends, I do sports. I play golf and I run. I have run two marathons. I also bought a racing bike. I want a healthy life because when I am on business trips, there\\'s usually not much exercise and a lot of eating and drinking, which isn\\'t good for the body. Do you lead a green lifestyle? I try to live an environmentally-friendly lifestyle. I separate my waste and we have energy and gas from green sources. My car is a hybrid and uses both fuel and electricity. These are only small things. But it shows that whenever it\\'s possible, we are trying to have a green approach to life. What\\'s your favorite Chinese city? I have been here many times since 1995, but I have not seen enough Chinese cities yet. The cities I visited are very special in themselves. Beijing has a rich history. Shanghai breathes the international dimension into China, so I like that as well. Looking out from a hotel in Pudong was a very nice experience, particularly at night. I have no special preferences, but I always like to visit new cities and to explore. zhuwenqian@chinadaily.com.cn ( China Daily European Weekly 01/20/2017 page31)'],\n",

The year-on-year increase reached 80 percent in South Korea, 55 percent in Russia and 97 percent in Costa Rica.   - Bottles of beer are selected for quality tests at Tsingtao\\'s production base in Luoyang, Henan province. Provided to China Daily  Founded in 1903 by beer-savvy German and British merchants in China, Tsingtao is sold in 94 countries and regions. The company has hosted one of the world\\'s largest beer festivals, the Qingdao International Beer Festival, or Asian Oktoberfest, for 26 years. In 2015, Tsingtao Brewery sold 8.48 million kiloliters of beer, with revenue reaching 27.64 billion yuan ($4.15 billion; 3.44 billion euros; 3.44 billion). It is now ranked fifth globally in the sector in terms of production output, according to the Barth Report, an authoritative beer industry compilation. In a recent interview, Sun Mingbo, chairman of Tsingtao Brewery, said: \"We want to actively explore overseas markets. There is consensus in China\\'s liquor industry that we need to build brands with an international reputation.\" The UK has pub culture and its consumers are very picky about beer quality and taste. That Tsingtao beer sales increased at least 10 percent annually in recent years is a tribute to its resilience in the market. According to James Wright, a UK-based Tsingtao dealer, there are more than 2,000 beer brands in the UK market. \"Tsingtao has actually been one of the stand-out brands. The Chinese brand\\'s market share kept growing in the UK\\'s imported beer sales,\" he says. This is all the more impressive when you consider that beer sales have stuttered in the UK in recent years due to the exorbitant duties, Wright says.    In Germany, where fresh breweries are seen all over and a total of 5,000 brands are sold, the average price of Tsingtao beer is set at 3 euros ($3.2; 2.6), compared with 0.8 euro to 1 euro of local brands. At least 150,000 boxes of Tsingtao beer have been sold in Germany annually in recent years. \"The pursuit of higher quality through innovation has been a major driver for Tsingtao\\'s overseas market expansion,\" says Sun. In order to ensure products meet high standards, Tsingtao brewers must stick to a strict and detailed brewing process, which has 113 years of history. Each bottle goes through 1,800 procedures before it is delivered to market. \"For a Chinese brand, it takes decades rather than years to gain recognition in the international markets, and the quality is the foundation to achieve that. \"Tsingtao does not intend to produce low-end products just to improve sales in the international market. Our products aim at the global middle and high-end markets.\" Tsingtao is also trying to diversify its products to meet changing market demand. For instance, Tsingtao\\'s factory in Qingdao used to produce only three kinds of beer in the 1980s, compared to the current 183 varieties. Tsingtao\\'s factories nationwide are producing 1,500 beer products across more than 20 categories.

It is hoped this will replace the annual import of 1,000 metric tons of special steel for making the pen tips. \"The feedstock, as small as it is (only 2.3 millimeters thick), requires an exact proportion of microelements,\" says Wang Huimian, senior engineer of Taiyuan Iron and Steel.   A quality control worker examines raw material used in the manufacture of ballpen tips at Taiyuan Iron & Steel Co Ltd in Shanxi province. Sun Ruisheng / China Daily  With 26 years\\' experience of working in technological development teams, Wang says that the ballpoint pens\\' feedstock was a tough nut to crack. \"The steel requires the exactly right proportion of a number of special microelements to maximize the pen\\'s performance. Even a small difference in the proportions of the elements would affect the final quality. If the right proportions could not be found, China would always have to rely on imports,\" says Wang. The tip of a ballpen is made up of two parts: the tungsten carbide ball for writing and the feedstock for holding the ball. China produces and exports the tungsten carbide ball. But the feedstock relies on imports from countries such as Switzerland and Japan. China\\'s overall iron and steel output is in excess. Yet most of the overcapacity is in ordinary and low-quality products. The country still has to import technology-intensive specialty steel. The country makes 38 billion ballpoint pens every year, more than any other country in the world. But it has to import more than 1,000 tons of steel for pen tips at 120,000 yuan ($17,386; 16,405 euros; 14,203) per ton. Taiyuan Iron & Steel\\'s project for developing homegrown feedstock started five years ago in collaboration with Beifa Group, one of China\\'s largest makers of ballpoint pens, based in Ningbo, Zhejiang province. Li Jianmin, technological director of Taiyuan Iron & Steel, said that additives in the steel affect the ability of the final product to resist corrosion. The quality of the feedstock is controlled by strictly managing the additives at every stage, including rolling, wire-drawing and heat treatment. \"The proportion of microelements that overseas companies use is usually a top secret. Taiyuan Iron & Steel has deciphered the proportion independently through thousands of experiments,\" Li says. The developers drew inspiration from making dough. \"If you want dough to be of just the right softness, you need additives. It\\'s the same with steel. The ordinary additives are in the shape of lumps. If they can be made fine and smooth, the liquid steel and additives will be more evenly blended,\" Wang says. The technological breakthrough has pushed up the stock price of Shanxi Taigang Stainless Steel Co Ltd, the group\\'s subsidiary listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. From Jan 9 to 11, its stock price rose by 27.4 percent to 5.12 yuan.

Nick J.B.

Rifkind, who was speaking in the lounge of the Intercontinental London Park Lane Hotel in Mayfair, says that pragmatic politicians differ from conviction politicians in that they don\\'t feel guilty adapting their positions to circumstances. \"The pragmatist is much more relaxed about it. It doesn\\'t mean the pragmatist has no convictions but if you are dealing with a problem and your previous conceptual or philosophical preference does not add up, it is OK to ask, what else would work?\"    In the book- full of dry observations and witty anecdotes-he recounts the negotiations leading up to the handover of Hong Kong back to China on June 30, 1997. He was foreign secretary up until a month before, when the Conservatives suffered a landslide defeat at the hand of incoming Labour prime minister Tony Blair and he himself lost his Edinburgh Pentlands seat in Parliament, which he had held for 23 years. He held his first meeting with Chinese foreign minister Qian Qichen in London in 1995 and when he visited Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland the following January he was given the nickname in the local press of \"Li Wenjun\", meaning \"a cultured gentleman\". \"Much of the hard work had already been done by Margaret Thatcher and Sir Geoffrey Howe (the former foreign secretary who had negotiated the 1984 Joint Declaration that paved the way for the handover). So I was just dealing with a number of unresolved issues, or new issues that had arisen. It was not too difficult,\" he says. \"Because we were approaching the moment of truth, obviously within Hong Kong itself there was increased nervousness about what the changeover would mean.\" Rifkind makes the point that Beijing resuming control of Hong Kong was an unprecedented event. \"It was a unique problem which required a unique solutions so it is fair to say that Hong Kong remains governed by a different system to the rest of China,\" he says. \"The fundamental commitment to two systems in one country has been honored, in the sense you know.\" The book charts his career from an up-and-coming Scottish advocate to being elected as a Member of Parliament when he was only in his late 20s. Although gifted with an uncanny ability-honed in debates at university-to speak without notes, he is slightly bemused by his reputation as an intellectual, which he modestly says belies his actual academic achievements at school. His first cabinet appointment came under Mrs Thatcher when he was made secretary of state for Scotland in 1986. He believes Scottish public opinion remains firmly against independence and that, as a result, Scotland\\'s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will not trigger a second referendum, despite her rhetoric.    \"Mrs Sturgeon is a very clever lady and she knows if she had one, she would almost certainly lose it.\" Rifkind says he is not surprised that China has emerged as such a powerful economy over the past 40 years. \"It was always inevitable that would happen. You could not have a country the size of China with such a huge population, as well as its historical and cultural identity going back 2,000 years, where that was not the case,\" he says. \"China should always have been a great power. It should always have been the largest or second largest economy in the world.\" He believes former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping\\'s reform and opening up agenda in the late 1970s proved the catalyst. \"Chinese societies that have had experience of capitalism have been brilliantly successful. The economic reforms in China, starting with Deng Xiaoping, turned China into a capitalist system, albeit with communist characteristics.\" One of the UK\\'s foreign policy shifts in recent years was the heralding of a new \"golden era\" of relations with China, culminating in Chinese President Xi Jinping\\'s state visit to London and Manchester in 2015. Some have suggested that new Prime Minister Theresa May is less willing than her predecessor David Cameron to fully embrace the world\\'s second largest economy. The new government, however, did finally give the go-ahead to Chinese investment in Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in the west of England, despite calling in the decision for review. \"If Mrs May\\'s government had ended up rejecting Hinkley Point, that would have represented a sea change. That would have been fundamental - but she didn\\'t,\" he says. \"There were a number of safeguards that were insisted upon but Chinese investment in the UK economy, and in particular its nuclear industry, is continuing. So to that degree there is continuity.\" One of the major questions is whether the UK\\'s referendum decision in June to leave the European Union will make it a less attractive place to invest. Rifkind, who supported the UK remaining in the EU, says the country\\'s uncertain status makes it more difficult for the Chinese and others to make investment decisions. \"Clearly any major companies from other parts of the world, who have a European market with a headquarters in the UK, ask themselves \"what does this mean for us?\" He, however, believes the UK will prove itself to be resilient in the end. \"If you only have 65 million people and you are the 5th or 6th largest economy in the world, that is an enormous economic achievement. That strength didn\\'t begin when we joined the EU and it doesn\\'t disappear because we have left it.\" Rifkind had to resign his seat before the 2015 General Election, having been caught up in a sting by the Channel 4 Dispatches program, where he was secretly filmed discussing a potential board position for a fictitious East European company. Suggestions there was a conflict of interest were later dismissed as groundless by the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner. The veteran politician, who at the time of this interview was about to address a conference on the Middle East, said he felt it was the right time to set the record straight on many aspects of his life by writing his autobiography. \"I\\'d always sort of assumed that in the dim and distant future I would write a book of this kind and it was about a year ago that I gradually had to come to terms with the fact that, as I was approaching 70, the dim and distant future had arrived.\" andrewmoody@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/20/2017 page32)'],\n",
       " ['Woman fights to popularize Eileen Chang in English nan Her work has inspired Oscar-winning director Ang Lee and she is considered one of the most important Chinese writers of the 20th century, but Eileen Chang has yet to make a major impact in the West. Translator Karen S. Kingsbury says she is determined to change that and persuade readers in the United States to understand why Chang is worthy of their attention through a biography she is working on. \"I am not planning just to write an English version of the already existing biographies in Chinese. I will try to speak to an American audience to explain why Eileen Chang is so worth their attention,\" says Kingsbury. When Kingsbury first read Chang\\'s Love in a Fallen City in Chinese, her Chinese wasn\\'t very good. \"But it\\'s like a magnet that pulls you into it, and you become a translator because of that text,\" recalls Kingsbury. The American academic wrote her doctoral dissertation on Chang, completing it in 1995, the same year Chang died in Los Angeles of cardiovascular disease.    Since then, Kingsbury has published translations of Chang\\'s Love in a Fallen City and Half a Lifelong Romance. Kingsbury\\'s translation of Love in a Fallen City was first published in Renditions, a literary journal run by Chinese University of Hong Kong, for a special issue in memory of Chang in 1996. Together with translations of Chang\\'s other short stories, it was later published by Penguin in 2007, and it has been selling steadily since then. The same year, Ang Lee released his erotic thriller Lust, Caution, based on a short story by Chang. The movie won many awards, including the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, and was nominated for a Golden Globe in the United States. The growing interest in Chang prompted Kingsbury to translate Half a Lifelong Romance, which took her six years to finish and was published by Penguin in 2014. Born to an elite family in Shanghai in 1920, Chang read a lot of classical Chinese literature and started publishing stories when she was still in middle school. She studied English literature at the University of Hong Kong and emigrated to the US in 1955. Chang\\'s life in the US was a personal and professional struggle. Her second husband, Ferdinand Reyher, an American screenwriter, suffered a series of strokes and died in 1967, and she didn\\'t gain much popularity until after her death. Kingsbury is a professor of international studies at the faculty of English at Chatham University in Pennsylvania, and Chang features strongly in the curriculum. \"It was very helpful to remind them (the students) that when you\\'re living in Shanghai in the 1930s - even though the Japanese are bombing the city and all kinds of terrible things are happening - there is still a kind of daily life that is going on,\" Kingsbury says at a seminar on translation in Beijing. By relegating major historical events, such as the Japanese invasion of China and the outbreak of World War II, Chang emphasized the private lives of her characters - human emotions, marriage and family matters. \"Chang\\'s works won\\'t appeal to everyone, but readers who like to peer deeply into psychology will like her writing,\" says Kingsbury. Kingsbury graduated from Whitman College in Washington in 1982 and spent the next year teaching English at Sichuan Foreign Studies University in China, where she began a lifelong passion for Chinese literature. She became interested in Chang when she was studying comparative literature at Columbia University in New York under the guidance of Hsia Chih-tsing and Wang Der-wei, two renowned scholars who praised Chang\\'s works.    - Kingsbury\\'s translations of Eileen Chang\\'s Half a Lifelong Romance and Love in a Fallen City.

       " ['Endangered species make up new focus nan Former paraglider stays connected to natural world through wildlife photography Gu Ying was once a paraglider, winning gold medals in national competitions. But now she is a wildlife photographer, taking photos of endangered species. In the past three years, Gu has trekked to the Earth\\'s \"three poles\" - the North Pole, South Pole and the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau - to catch a glimpse of wildlife living in the most extreme environments of the planet. Her shots of polar bears, emperor penguins and Tibetan antelopes, and her efforts to promote public awareness of endangered animals, won her the title of 2016 Chinese Culture Person of the Year, awarded on Jan 11 by the Chinese Culture Promotion Society.   - Tibetan antelopes cross the Qinghai-Tibet Highway in a picture Gu Ying took in 2016 in Qinghai\\'s Hol Xil. Provided to China Daily  Gu was born into a military family in Beijing. Her parents worked in the air force and, when she was still a little girl her family was relocated to a radar base in the mountains near Xuzhou, Jiangsu province. \"Sometimes I missed the school bus and had to walk alone on the mountainous paths between home and school,\" recalls Gu. \"I got my guts and love for nature during that period of time.\" After graduating from university, Gu worked in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, and started a successful business in the late 1990s, but she never forgot about the mountains and went outdoors whenever she could. Once, when Gu was hiking on a mountain, a paraglider flew by and waved at her. \"I was thrilled because I once wanted to be a fighter pilot,\" says Gu. \"The paraglider evoked my childhood dream.\" Gu then registered for a paragliding course and, after three weeks\\' training, made her first flight. \"It felt like I was a bird and belonged to the sky.\"    Since then, Gu has taken many classes and later became a paragliding athlete. She won gold medals four times in national competitions and set a national women\\'s record for 100-kilometer paragliding. In 2009, Gu fell from the sky in an accident and broke her back. Luckily, her spine was not irreparably injured. After three months in bed, Gu was able to stand up again, but she had to say goodbye to her paragliding career. \"We paragliders call ourselves birdmen,\" says Gu. \"When I couldn\\'t fly like a bird, I found another hobby - taking photographs of birds.\" Since 2011, Gu has taken photos of around 1,000 species of birds in dozens of countries. Some of her photos of rare birds have been included in The Handbook of the Birds of the World. Starting with bird photography, Gu gradually became a wildlife photographer. In 2014, she embarked on a journey to capture the moment polar bears bring their newborn cubs out of their caves after hibernation. It took her more than 10 days at a base within the Arctic Circle in Canada to get a good shot. The next year, Gu flew to inland Antarctica to take shots of the emperor penguin. This time, she was stuck in a camp near the habitat of the penguins for 18 days because of strong storms caused by the El Nino effect. \"Everyone was frustrated, but I was very happy because I could spend more time taking photos of emperor penguins,\" says Gu. \"And only in storms could one capture their real living environment.\" \"Every day, I spent more than 10 hours out there photographing the penguins,\" adds Gu. Last year, she went to Hoh Xil in Qinghai province three times. She wanted to photograph Tibetan antelopes in the least populated area of China, 5,000 meters above sea level. In order to capture the Tibetan antelope\\'s breeding process, Gu remained hidden from 5am to 9pm every day. \"I could not go outside, nor eat any food that had a smell. It was really tough, but I think it was worth it,\" says Gu, whose photos have been used by the Hoh Xil local government in applying for UNESCO\\'s World Heritage List. \"After all these years photographing wildlife, recording their lives has begun to feel like a responsibility for me,\" says Gu. \"But I don\\'t want my photos to be the last \\'living monuments\\' of those species that can be seen only in a frame.\" xingyi@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/20/2017 page19)'],\n",
       " ['Open the gates nan Imagining public parks with no walls Imagine a park that has no barrier from the surrounding neighborhood, nothing to prevent you stepping right off the sidewalk into the park from any direction. This is hardly a revolutionary concept in urban design. In fact, you could be forgiven for thinking it is, in fact, the dictionary definition of a public park.       The announcement of a plan by a land developer in Shanghai\\'s Xuhui district to make an open-access, fenceless green space on land donated by the local government in the new central business district was enthusiastically received by local media, which promoted it as a centerpiece of modernized city planning and Xuhui\\'s own version of Central Park. Back in 2009, the Guangzhou government\\'s \"give the park back to the people\" movement had the same bright idea, proposing the removal of the walls around three of its biggest urban parks. In this case, however, the plans were temporarily halted due to an outcry from local residents. One elderly Guangzhou resident said: \"Tear down the walls, and you can no longer call it a park.\" His argument was a linguistic one - the character å\\x9b?(yu¨¢n), for garden, is the Chinese word for \"public park\" (å\\x85¬å\\x9b\\xad, gÅ\\x8dng yu¨¢n, public garden) uses the radical, which comes from the ancient ideographic representation for enclosure. Other citizens translated his concern into more practical terms: without walls, what was to prevent the park from becoming a \"free hotel\" for the homeless, or a wretched hive of criminals who could enter and escape at will? Encouraged by official directives to add recreational areas and green spaces to the urban landscape, cities in China are increasingly building so-called \"open-style parks\" (å¼\\x80æ\\x94¾å¼\\x8få\\x85¬å\\x9b\\xad, kÄ\\x81ifÃ\\xa0ng shÃ¬ gÅ\\x8dngyu¨¢n ). But the history of truly open-plan, public-access parks in China is short, and the learning curve they present is steep. Until the early 2000s, most \"public\" parks in China - defined simply as parks not reserved for use by any danwei (å\\x8d\\x95ä½\\x8d, dÄ\\x81n w¨¦i), or work unit - not only had walls and fences but charged admission to enter. In 2002, Shanghai and the city of Zhuhai, Guangdong province, began to offer free admission to a limited number of their parks. Beijing followed in 2006. However, the terminology of \"open-style parks\" is misleading; in most cases, even without a ticket office, the parks have retained guarded entrances, opening and closing hours, and enclosures all around the perimeter. Beijing\\'s Ming Dynasty City Wall Relics Park is a special case. By the standards common to Chinese landscaping, they\\'ve gone and put walls on the wrong side. Completed in 2006, the park consists of grassy knolls, winding paths, and flowering shrubs buttressed against one of the last remaining sections of Beijing\\'s ancient fortifications; on the other side, the grass runs straight up against the sidewalk. \"Strictly speaking, that makes us an open-style green space, not an open-style park,\" says the manager of the park office, surnamed Shi. Last October, when Shanghai\\'s Xiangyang Park was reopened after renovations, which included the removal of the park\\'s outer walls, the response from the community was lukewarm. \"They don\\'t understand that the wall itself is a part of landscaping, it\\'s architecture,\" a long-time park visitor was reported as telling local news blog Shanghai Guangcha. Chinese landscaping scholar Yang Han has published papers that have been generally approving of the opening up of China\\'s urban parks, referring to the trend as the natural accompaniment for modern, urban society\\'s recreational needs. However, he has also argued that walls should not be \"blindly removed\" because their long cultural and symbolic history, as well as architectural details, make them an invaluable \"Chinese characteristic\" in landscape architecture. Walls have played an indispensable role in the two ancient styles that influenced traditional Chinese landscaping, the \"imperial garden (å¾¡è\\x8a±å\\x9b? yÃ¹ huÄ\\x81 yu¨¢n)\" and \"literati garden (æ\\x96\\x87äººå\\x9b\\xadæ\\x9e\\x97, w¨¦nr¨¦n yu¨¢nl¨ªn)\". Imperial gardens originated from early imperial hunting grounds, which were walled off to all users except for the emperor. These later evolved into private retreats in which the emperor could relax and enjoy his diverse, often exotic collection of plants. As with City Wall Park\\'s corner tower, there is a sense the garden being a place to preserve and showcase objects of historical interest. The \"literati garden\", of which the private gardens of China\\'s Jiangnan region are the most famous example, favored a simpler aesthetic consisting of native plants and more naturalistic arrangements. Built with a philosophy of \"high walls and deep courtyards (é«\\x98å¢\\x99å¤§é\\x99¢, gÄ\\x81oqi¨¢ng dÃ\\xa0yuÃ\\xa0n)\", they were meant to be secluded spaces for the scholar\\'s literary and spiritual contemplation, influenced by the so-called \"hermit culture in the tumultuous Northern and Southern Dynasties (420-589) period. Under this culture, educated men were encouraged to retreat from political life and cultivate their moral qualities in nature. Stepping into a Chinese park still feels like discovering a private sanctuary: Residents walk slower and without fear of being run over by bikes, while the sounds of the city are muted behind the old melodies playing on the radio as seniors dance. But Zhang Jie, a landscape engineer attached to the Parks and Greening Management Bureau of Changsha, Hunan province, is not sure that such a place ought to qualify as a public park. To him, they fail to incorporate the first character of å\\x85¬å\\x9b\\xad, which is å\\x85?(public). Screened behind walls and fences, recreation takes place out of the sight of passersby, instead of being integrated into each resident\\'s sensory experience of the city. This is a mode of life that Zhang calls \"participatory\". It was with the intention of increasing the participatory character of their communities that the Changsha government, earlier last year, gave the order to remove the walls around their public parks. \"Our country has always advocated \"\\x98getting close to people\\'s hearts\\', and there\\'s no better way than to welcome them to our spaces,\" Zhang says. These days, while many universities and military units are still set up like this, most urban residents of China find themselves living in their own apartments and crossing paths with strangers at every turn. In essence, this forces Chinese urban residents to adjust to a concept of \"public space\" where they must coexist with and respect the individual needs of others, rather than the socialist \"communal space\" in which they shared with others a similar, state-mandated style of living. To Zhang, this is a positive development in helping residents \"get to know their neighbors, their city, their government\". However, it\\'s also the source of much of the controversy in response to open parks in cities like Guangzhou and Shanghai, as residents\\' unease toward public spaces spills into the last remaining institutions that symbolized the old style of governance and security. Zhang says he has not received any feedback from residents anxious about their safety or the suzhi (ç´\\xa0è´¨), or \"quality\" of their fellow park visitors after the removal of the walls, though he admits that open parks are potentially more challenging to make safe and orderly for users. The views from the ground are mixed. On a weekday morning, a knot of local residents exercising at the City Wall Park share their impressions of the park\\'s good points and bad. They unanimously say that ease of access is the main reason that they come to the park, some of them every day. Shi believes that her park has been more or less free from controversy due to the security investments taken by Beijing as a whole. \"Each city has its own concept of safety, a different threshold for accepting these open public spaces,\" she says. Residents of Guangzhou, would probably have different concerns about its safety compared to the capital. Fang agrees that the impression of public safety is not purely due to the presence of guards but the quality of Beijing residents. \"This is a nice neighborhood,\" she stresses.

Internet celebrities are ordinary people striving to become online sensations by showing off their talents. Such celebrities in China have millions of fans, generating huge profits. Some of the most popular reportedly earn more than 300,000 yuan ($43,300; 40,638 euros; 40,638) monthly. This may explain why Nerve, which examines the dark side of the internet-celebrity craze, has struck a chord with many young Chinese, who now form a major part of the theater-going population. Since it opened on the Chinese mainland on Jan 6 - the same day as the tentpole Rogue One: A Star Wars Story - Nerve has become the second highest-grossing movie among the Hollywood imports currently on the country's big screen. Directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, the duo known for the internet fraud-themed documentary and series Catfish, the 96-minute film returns to a familiar zone: online violence triggered by the web's anonymous environment. The film is based on a livestreamed game that gives weird or risky dares to players and cash rewards to the most-watched winners. It begins with tasks such as kissing a stranger or running away from a public place naked. In the movie, the protagonist, a high-school girl played by American actress Emma Roberts, is dragged into a lethal trap where viewers want to see a win-or-die competition between her and her competitor, played by Dave Franco. Despite the film's popularity, most Chinese viewers reported feeling a bit disappointed with the latter part of the film. While they expected it to take an in-depth look at internet culture and its negative effects, the film's conclusion failed to meet that expectation. xufan@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/20/2017 page20)\"],\n",

It\\'s part of Yogi Yoga\\'s recent public service campaign to tackle the problems of depression and anxiety among Chinese university students. The yoga center is doing a tour of 10 top universities in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai to teach students to fight stress with yoga.   - Yin Yan cofounded Yogi Yoga with Indian yoga master Man Mohan Bhandari in 2003 to promote yoga in China. Photos provided to China Daily  Yogi Yoga aims to help 100 universities within 100 days and is encouraging institutions to organize yoga classes, saying it will send volunteers to teach. \"I want to share authentic Indian yoga with others. Yoga practice can help Chinese students enjoy campus life, rather than suffer stress and anxiety,\" says Yogi Yoga co-founder Yin Yan. The former editor-in-chief of fashion magazine Elle China, she co-founded Yogi Yoga with Indian yoga master Man Mohan Bhandari, better known in China as Yogi Mohan, in 2003. They later became a couple and now have two children. \"It is estimated that more than 90 million people in China suffer from depression. The campaign aims to help those who have the potential to fall victim to depression,\" she says. Bhandari has developed some yoga postures that he says are helpful in stress management for university students. He speaks at universities and shares videos online so that more students can benefit from yoga. He also has a Sina Weibo account to answer questions from those who practice yoga. Until the end of December, a yoga teacher will be doing a daily live broadcast beginning at 7 am on an account named Yoga Digest on Sina Weibo, to encourage the Chinese to learn the ancient Indian practice. Each video attracts tens of thousands of hits. Yogi Yoga has also worked with Peking University to establish a yoga training center to offer one semester of free courses for university students, including meditation and breathing. \"Scientific research shows that yoga has positive effects in combating depression and anxiety. Yoga can help deal with one\\'s nervous system. And once your system becomes quiet, your mind will be quiet,\" says Bhandari. According to Bhandari, those who suffer from depression have one problem - they cannot breathe properly. Yoga, he says, can help them balance the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the body. In India, most people know about yoga. They know that it is not only a physical exercise, but also deals with the mind, energy and spirituality. But for Chinese students, he has to first teach the basics. He believes there are not many differences between teaching in India and in China. Yin practices yoga postures and breathing every morning, to stretch her body. She suggests others find time to fully concentrate on yoga. \"Yoga is a good way to ease pressure and make you sleep better. Many have the misconception that it is only for those whose body is supple. Actually, those who have a stiff body should practice yoga to keep their body balanced,\" she says. \"Yoga is not a career, but it is my destiny (to promote it). It gives me faith and power,\" says Yin. For Yin, her link to yoga and her husband came from a 21-day journey to India in 2003. She spent the first week in Rishikesh to learn traditional yoga. The city is known as \"the yoga capital of the world\", with numerous yoga centers that attract visitors from all over the world. She was a bit depressed when she first saw the city\\'s streets after heavy rain: narrow muddy roads, stray dogs and vendors loudly hawking their goods. When she first encountered Bhandari, she was impressed that the young man in white robes was quiet and professional. After one week of learning yoga postures from him, her perspective began to change. There were adorable dogs in the streets filled with sunshine and friendly locals with smiles on their faces. \"In that week, nothing changed but me. As my body became relaxed and soft, so did my heart,\" she says. \"Happiness can be simple. Yoga taught me that happiness is about whether or not you are in a balanced and optimistic state. When you are in society, that state may be affected subconsciously. But yoga can help you to remain positive.\" It also stirred her creativity and she wrote a Chinese book, Song of India, the same year about the trip that changed her life. In August 2003, Yin and Bhandari co-founded Yogi Yoga in Beijing, a few months after she invited him to the city to teach her and her friends yoga. While Yin is in charge of management and operations, Bhandari is responsible for teaching. \"Yin has great vision, and she wants to give the benefits of yoga to society and initiated the events at universities,\" says Bhandari. According to Yin, yoga helps people to have an optimistic attitude toward life. Yoga is an in-depth study, not just a series of poses. She says it is better to practice yoga under the guidance of professionals to find what suits you best. For example, for those who have lumbar disc protrusion, some postures are good while others are not. xulin@chinadaily.com.cn   - Man Mohan Bhandari believes yoga can help those who suffer from depression to balance the oxygen and carbon dioxide level in the body.

       " ['Cozying up to the Kitchen God nan Editor\\'s note: To understand China, sit down to eat. Food is the indestructible bond that holds the whole social fabric together and it is also one of the last strong bonds of community and culture. It\\'s only fair that we should pay homage to one of the most ancient of Chinese deities in a food column devoted to a culture largely incubated in the territory he reigns over - the kitchen. Zaojun, the Kitchen God, is a fair-faced celestial being who spends only a few days in the heavenly court of the Jade Emperor. For most of the year, he presides over the heart and hearth of earthly households, guarding the livestock, the servants and, most of all, the cooking stove. He is privy to the darkest secrets, and he sees all.   - From as long as we can remember, the portrait of the Kitchen God, seen here with his wife, has reigned over the cooking stove in many Chinese kitchens. Jin Yuequan / For China Daily  He listens to the back room gossip, the quarrels among the womenfolk. He witnesses the trickery of malingering servants, the secret stashes of food hidden for a stolen feast, the cutting of corners in the making of a complicated dish, the whispered rumors, the scandalous truths. For those reasons, when it is time for him to ascend to make his annual reports, the whole household is suddenly alerted to his imminent departure and he is showered with food offerings to put him in the best of moods. Yes, even the gods must be bribed. In this case, the Kitchen God is sent off with an appropriate feast, all of which will include a final offering that is very sticky, and very sweet. These sticky sweets, the foolish humans hope, will seal his lips or sweeten his tongue and he will return in the new year with the appropriate bountiful blessings from heaven after making a positive assessment of their merits. Right now, in kitchens large and small all across China, the preparations are starting. Zaojun will be traveling to report to his boss soon, on the 23rd day of the last lunar month, which is Jan 20. He has been doing this every year for a long, long time - as far back as the Xia Dynasty (c.21st century-16th century BC), more than 2,000 years before Christ was born. The Xia was the first recorded dynasty in Chinese history, so it is likely Zaojun has been around even longer than that. Basically, the Kitchen God has been guardian of the stove ever since the Chinese started cooking indoors. The day of his departure also signals the start to a flurry of preparations for the official arrival of Spring, a week away. His portrait, probably smoky from standing over the stove for an entire year, will be taken down, smeared with honey and reverently burnt to send him on his way. In the new year, a brand new portrait will go up on the wall. Meanwhile, the kitchen and its inhabitants will be pretty busy. There is even a folk rhyme to guide you through it all: Twenty-third, pumpkin candies, twenty-fourth, spring cleaning. Twenty-fifth, tofu time, twenty-sixth, make meat stew. Twenty-seventh, kill the rooster, twenty-eighth, rise the dough. Twenty-ninth, steam the buns, New Year\\'s Eve, stay up late New Year\\'s Day, celebrate! Once Zaojun leaves, replete with sticky pumpkin-shaped candies, the mops and dusters come out the next day and every dustball and each cobweb is industriously swept up and removed. The more creative among the girls will start crafting beautiful paper cut-outs from auspicious red paper. Fruits and flowers, the Chinese characters for happiness and spring, images of deer and bats and other lucky icons - all these will be pasted on windows and walls. Those with good calligraphy skills will be called upon to write couplets of good wishes that will go across lintels and door frames. All on red paper. In the meantime, an enormous amount of cooking will be done - starting with the slaughter of the chickens, ducks, pigs and goats to the soaking of soy beans for the making of tofu. Another important task is the bun making. Steamed buns are very much part of the daily diet all year round, but the buns for the New Year will be decorated with dates and shaped into impressive works of art. In my own household, Ayi and I will be creating flower buns cut from strips of dough artfully twisted into blossoms. Ayi comes from Henan, where the ladies are really good at turning dough into masterpieces of miniature architecture. She has taught me how to press dried Chinese jujubes into the dough for instant effect. The red fruits add color and flavor as well. We also make piggy buns because the pig is, of course, a symbol of prosperity. In the southern regions of China, a sticky rice cake called niangao is also prepared. The basic recipe is golden syrup and glutinous rice flour. Occasionally, red beans and coconut milk are added and the mixture poured into containers lined with bamboo or coconut leaves. These days, elaborate jelly molds are used to shape the cakes, with fish molds being the most popular because fish is homophonic with \"overflowing abudance\". At this time of the year, rituals and symbolic foods become part of the celebrations and even though some may seem to be based simply on superstitions, they are still oddly comforting and very much part of the festivities that make a new lunar year so very special. As for the Kitchen God, I\\'m pretty sure he enjoys the attention he gets every year and he never fails to return, duty completed, and ready for another year listening in on the household secrets. paulined@chinadaily.com.cn   - To worship the god, crafting paper cut-outs, fruits and flowers, images of lucky icons - all these will be pasted on windows and walls while food such as buns and desserts will be prepared.

A good number of the country\\'s more than 200 million migrant workers will return home to smaller cities and villages, bearing gifts for the children they have left behind in their pursuit of work in bigger cities. A central government survey released in November suggests China now has 9 million children at or under the age of 16 whose parents work away from their domiciles. In 2013, the All China Women Federation, a government-backed agency said the country had 60 million such children under the age of 18. Analysts say the new survey\\'s methodology is different from the previous one in terms of the children\\'s age as well as the categorization of absent parents. Some sociologists expect an actual decline in the number in coming years, with signs of more family migrations. But a recent visit to East China\\'s Anhui province, which is among the top inland areas for outward migration, showed that on the other side of the country\\'s economic boom lie villages and small towns that continue to battle a deep emotional void.   - A girl and her grandfather live in Fuyang, Anhui province.  In rural patches of Fuyang, a large municipal-level city located more than 200 kilometers northwest of the provincial capital Hefei, most residents are the elderly and their young grandchildren. Here, the working age population is simply missing. Hundreds of empty houses dotted across farmlands provide further evidence of desertion. In the Houyuan neighborhood of Wuli village, for instance, more than half of the 22 households have children in the care of their grandparents. In adjacent Dongzhou, of the settlement\\'s 65 residents, the majority face a similar situation. Local government officials estimate 2.8 million people from Fuyang\\'s population of 10 million live in different parts of the country. Guo Lin, chairwoman of the Fuyang Women\\'s Federation, says the migrants mostly move to wealthier eastern provinces, such as Zhejiang and Jiangsu, and Shanghai to do low-level jobs in manufacturing, services, construction and other sectors. As a result, 179,000 children under the age of 18 have been left behind in Fuyang, she says. The term used to describe such children emerged from the so-called left-behind wives whose husbands had migrated from Anhui and other provinces, such as Sichuan, Henan, Guizhou, Hunan and Hubei, to mainly coastal cities in the 1990s. In the following decade, the women themselves started to migrate. A large number of female domestic helpers in Beijing came from Anhui back then.    \"The 2016 survey considers the legal working age of young Chinese and of families where both parents have migrated,\" Guo says of the differences between the new central government study and ACWF\\'s 2013 survey that counted such children even when one parent was missing. Sociologists have previously also studied migration patterns in the rural reaches of relatively affluent places such as Chongqing and Guangdong province. In the Houyuan area of Fuyang\\'s Wuli village, Zhou Peisheng and his wife, Liu Guilan, have been raising their granddaughter for the past three years. The couple\\'s daughter and son-in-law are a waitress and a chef at a restaurant in Nanjing in Jiangsu province. \"It\\'s no trouble taking care of her, she isn\\'t naughty,\" Zhou says of his granddaughter, Ni Yuting, aged 9. Her parents keep long working hours, which is why Ni can\\'t live with them in Nanjing, he says. Ni wants to see her parents more often and for longer periods than just during the annual holidays. She also wants to know \"what gifts they will bring for me\". In Zhou\\'s neighborhood, most working age couples have migrated to Hangzhou in Zhejiang province, where the G20 Summit was held last year. Zhou was once a crop farmer who worked part-time at rural construction sites in Fuyang. Today, he is among the better-off people in his locality, with income coming in from growing vegetables. His daughter sends money home as well. For Song Jinlan, a 55-year-old resident of Dongzhou area in the same Wuli village, life is slightly harder. The widow has been looking after her grandson since his birth six years ago. Her son works in Hangzhou driving trucks that carry construction materials and her daughter-in-law works at a textile unit in the city. Her son sends her 1,000 yuan ($145; 136.7 euros; 120.70) a month on average, Song says. In addition, she earns some money from selling corn and other crops that she grows. In 2015, Fuyang\\'s per capita rural dispensable income was 9,001 yuan on average per year. Song\\'s son and daughter-in-law come home every Chinese New Year and stay for less than two weeks. This year the couple want to arrive ahead of the Spring Festival week to hold a ceremony to cut a few strands of long hair their son has been wearing since early childhood as a traditional symbol of good fortune. But so far, Song says, her son hasn\\'t been granted the extra leave he requested. \"Without his parents around, I sometimes feel helpless, especially when the kid falls sick,\" she says pointing to her grandson, Zhou Junhao, aged 6. In the town of Xihu, some distance from Wuli village, former schoolteacher Du Fengcai and his wife have raised two grandsons in the past 20 years. Du\\'s son, a longtime migrant who now runs a hotel in the tourist city of Dali, in Southwest China\\'s Yunnan province, can\\'t take his 13-year-old younger child along because of the limited options for education there, Du says. His older grandson, aged 22, has joined his parents\\' business in Dali. Du longs for reform of the country\\'s household registration system, or hukou, to increase the educational prospects for the children of migrant workers in host cities. While the first nine years of education are compulsory in China, the existing hukou system throws some challenges at migrants. The 2016 government survey makes mention of the reform, too. While at least 8 million grandparents form the backbone of second-generation parenting in China today, this aging group, with limited resources at its disposal, is often unable to provide the emotional support that the grandchildren, especially teenagers, need. \"Some problems of left-behind children are being solved with the country\\'s economic progress, but their psychological lives still need attention,\" says Lu Shizhen, deputy chairwoman at the China Youth and Children\\'s Research Association, a Beijing-based affiliate of the China Youth University of Political Studies. Lu advocates long-term professional counseling, not just for the affected children but also for their primary caregivers. The children of migrant couples are \"de facto orphans\", she says, adding that a mix of economic and social reasons has triggered the situation. According to the new survey, a percentage of the 9 million children largely live without adult supervision on a daily basis, effectively forcing them to stay alone. In an appalling case last year, police reported the deaths of four siblings, aged 5 to 14, in Guizhou, among the country\\'s poorest provinces. In a \"suicide note\" written before they died, the eldest said their mother, who worked in a different place, hadn\\'t visited them in a year and a half. Other than abject loneliness, unsupervised children in particular are at risk of sexual abuse. A few years ago, 19 cases of sexual assault on girls under the age of 18 were registered in Henan province, China Youth Daily reported. With the majority of \"left-behind\" children living in villages, there\\'s also a need to include more women in countryside Party committees, Lu says. Last year, the State Council, China\\'s cabinet, issued a set of guidelines for local governments to follow, including setting up more child welfare centers across the country. \"How central policies percolate down to the grassroots level is the key question,\" Lu says. That\\'s where the real implementation is necessary.

       " ['Melancholy life of teenager who must fend for herself nan Fan Xiaohui, 15, is among the 4 percent of 9 million \"left-behind\" children in China who are deprived of adult supervision by a close family member on a daily basis. [ZHU LIXIN/CHINA DAILY]  Fan Xiaohui, 15, is among the 4 percent of 9 million \"left-behind\" children in China who are deprived of adult supervision by a close family member on a daily basis. Some sociologists argue that the percentage of such children is less than estimated but these cases, even if they are in the minority, are of grave societal concern. While she understands her mother\\'s inability to take phone calls at work, and the fact that her parents and a 10-year-old brother live in a cramped room in the capital\\'s Haidian district, Fan is working hard to cope with the psychological fallout from the family\\'s decision to send her to Fuyang to continue her education. The bespectacled girl, whose bright smile seldom betrays her pain, was born in Huzong village in the same county. When she was 3, her parents, now both in their late 30s, migrated to Beijing along with her. There she studied for a few years in a school for the children of migrant workers but eventually her parents realized Fan needed better access to resources that her hometown could provide. She was enrolled into the Central School of Huzong Township in Fuyang. In China, migrant workers aren\\'t often able to send their children to schools of their choosing in host cities because of the household registration system, or hukou. A reform of the system has been urged by many and may happen eventually. Fan lives in a furnished apartment that belongs to a relative who only occasionally stays in it. A typical weekday in her life involves waking up; going to school, which is a few minutes by foot; studying and eating meals at school; playing chess and reading Russian authors for fun; and \"meeting\" childhood friends on social media, most of whom are the so-called left-behind children. On the weekend, she visits her ailing grandfather in the nearby village of her birth, where he lives in a dilapidated house. Fan can\\'t live in it, she says, because \"it\\'s falling apart\". She doesn\\'t need to shop for groceries or cook. She washes her own clothes and does daily chores that aren\\'t unusual for any teenager. When China Daily met with her recently, the interview was brief as she was studying for an upcoming exam. Questions that could have provided a deeper glimpse into her life remain unanswered because of a shortage of time. Used to life in the big city, Fan initially struggled to adapt to her new semi-urban existence. She was afraid of living alone, she says. But her school seems to have played a significant role in easing her situation. Of a total 775 students here, 543 are children whose parents work in cities outside of Fuyang. Guan Dongkui, the principal, says his school acts as a second home for such children. \"We help them fight loneliness.\" Fan\\'s parents and sibling usually visit her during the weeklong Spring Festival holiday. She also travels to Beijing when schools close for the summer. \"I don\\'t have real dreams yet because dreaming isn\\'t always practical,\" she says with the wisdom of a person who has been forced to grow up early. But Fan isn\\'t totally dismissive of the future either. She would like to travel the world if she makes enough money, she says. Zhu Lixin contributed to this story.

They are now hoping that well-wishers can help him complete the treatment and give him the chance of a better life. Li Xianyu, 68, discovered the child she later named Zhao Xuecheng under a bridge in Xiangyang, Hubei province, in 1994. \"It was around Spring Festival and it was snowing,\" she recalls, adding that she had been on her way home from selling vegetables and heard the soft crying of a baby. She searched a nearby bush and found the child.   - Zhao Xuecheng, whose face was severely burned during his childhood, longs for a normal life. Ran Wen / For China Daily  \"His face was totally burned, so much so that I could hardly tell his facial features,\" she says. \"I immediately realized he\\'d been abandoned.\" Li took the child home to her husband, Zhao Liniu. He recalls: \"I was afraid the baby would die at any minute due to his severe wounds.\" They named him Xuecheng, which means \"happening in snow\".    After the Spring Festival holiday, the couple took the boy to a hospital but could not afford the cost of plastic surgery, which would have been tens of thousands of yuan. They barely made ends meet by planting and selling vegetables and had little money saved. So they bought some medicine and fed him milk powder and rice soup. After three months, the scars on the boy\\'s face began to heal. When he reached the age of 7, he was rejected by schools because of his appearance. Finally, one accepted him but he could not bear the discrimination and bullying and dropped out a year later. The couple, who only had primary school education themselves, taught him at home. When their vegetable business struggled, they began picking through garbage for recyclables to make money. Zhao Xuecheng is now 22 but has been unable to find work because of his disfigurement, Li says. \"We are getting old and he has to making a living by himself. All we can do is use our savings, 30,000 yuan ($4,370; 4,085 euros; 3,542), to get him the surgery he needs.\" This month, the family arrived at Chongqing\\'s Southwest Hospital affiliated with the Third Military Medical School. The 30,000 yuan covered the cost of the first surgery. Now their son is out of the hospital and in six months he will have another operation, which is expected to cost more than 80,000 yuan. After the couple\\'s plight was reported by local media, donations began pouring in to help cover the medical bills, Li says. tanyingzi@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/20/2017 page15)'],\n",

But instead of flying, she spends most of her time meeting passengers arriving at Beijing Capital International Airport in her role as a \"pickup assistant\" - a new job that has arisen along with the demand for mobile ride-hailing. \"Our job is to help car-hailers find the rides they have booked as soon as they get off planes. Most of them are first-time visitors to Beijing,\" says Gong, one of more than 170 people who have landed this type of job. Their services are used heavily by Didi Chuxing, China\\'s largest ride-hailing platform.   Gong Xiaopei, a \"pickup assistant\", contacts passengers at Beijing Capital International Airport in December. Wang Zhuangfei / For China Daily  As China steps up efforts to restructure its economy, the country\\'s burgeoning digital sector is creating new jobs for millions of people like Gong. Besides \"pickup assistants\", other new titles include \"cyber anchors\" who rake in as much as 1,000 yuan ($145; 136 euros; 120) a day by live streaming advice on such subjects as playing electronic games, map information collectors who drive around China collecting road data, and purchasing agents who help Chinese buy products in foreign countries. Zhang Dayi, 28, a former model, is one of the cyber celebrities who have made it big in the country\\'s booming digital marketplace. She opened a shop in 2014 on Taobao, Alibaba Group\\'s online marketplace. By offering a range of online advice to women on makeup, hairdos and wardrobes, she accumulated over 4.5 million fans on Sina Weibo, a Chinese version of Twitter. Her fans are eager to mimic Zhang\\'s wardrobe, overwhelming her shop whenever new designs are released. In November, 5,000 garments were sold within two seconds on Zhang\\'s store, equivalent to the annual sales of a small brick-and-mortar store. These new jobs are particularly popular among young people who put a premium on freedom and flexibility when considering careers, says Shen Meng, director of Chanson & Co, a boutique investment bank in China. \"Compared with previous generations, who prioritized salaries, young people are increasingly in favor of positions that are intertwined with their hobbies,\" Shen says. Experts say that these jobs are so new that many people know little about them or how to break into one of the new fields. A survey by QQ browser, owned by Tencent Holdings, showed that only about 3.8 percent of 13,000 university students born after 1995 indicated a preference for new jobs created by the digital economy. However, among those interested, cyber anchors, voice actors and game testers were among the jobs most desired. The push to crack down on pornography on the internet has also given rise to a new profession. Jiao Yi, CEO of iweiju, a Guangzhou-based startup that develops social networking apps, says almost every internet content firm in China has recruited people to delete inappropriate user-generated content, with some firms recruiting as many as 50 so-called \"porn-detectors\". The digital economy is breathing new life into many traditional industries that have struggled with declining growth. Thanks to the e-commerce boom, for instance, China\\'s logistics industry has been creating an average of 200,000 new jobs annually in recent years, says Ma Junsheng, head of the State Postal Bureau, the industry regulator. In 2015, about 113 million Chinese worked in businesses driven by China\\'s digital economy, according to a report by Boston Consulting Group. \"As information technologies continue to revolutionize the retail, entertainment, finance, manufacturing and other industries, China\\'s digital economy will reach $16 trillion by 2035, with 415 million jobs created accumulatively,\" the report forecasts. That\\'s up from $1.4 trillion in 2015. \"If not for the robust growth of the internet and the sharing economy, China would have been under unprecedented employment pressure, weighed down by slowing GDP growth,\" says Zhang Yansheng, director of the National Development and Reform Commission\\'s Institute for International Economics Research. \"Digital businesses are not taking jobs away from traditional sectors. They are creating new jobs,\" he adds. masi@chinadaily.com.cn   ( China Daily European Weekly 01/20/2017 page14)'],\n",
       " ['Xinjiang to invest huge amount in road network nan Huge plan will aid in Belt and Road development, increase opportunities and employment The Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region will inject record funding into building new roads this year so it can better serve as China\\'s trade hub linking countries along the Silk Road Economic Belt. New infrastructure projects are also expected to bring more job opportunities for locals, the region\\'s top economic planning official says. This year, the northwestern region will invest 170 billion yuan ($24.8 billion; 23.1 billion euros; 20.1 billion) on new roads, up nearly six fold from 2016. The region has never seen such investment in road construction, Zhang Chunlin, director of the Xinjiang Development and Reform Commission, says in an exclusive interview in the regional capital of Urumqi. The region will also invest 8.1 billion yuan in constructing railways and 4.8 billion yuan in civil aviation projects, both up by 50 percent from last year. The investment in roads, railways and airports this year will top the total funding for transportation infrastructure from 2011 to 2015.    Building a highway network in a region that takes up a sixth of China\\'s territory is a priority, Zhang says. Currently, about 40 percent of the cities and counties in Xinjiang are not connected by highways. \"Without the highways, oil, coal and agricultural products of Xinjiang cannot be shipped out of the region smoothly, and logistics costs will remain high,\" Zhang says. After the planned highway network is completed, logistics costs in the region can be reduced by 30 percent, he adds. The region plans to start construction this year on 6,096 kilometers of highways. Although poor infrastructure has been holding back development of the region, Xinjiang now sees opportunity for economic growth. Massive transportation projects can use significant amounts of steel and concrete, which can help to stimulate economic growth. What\\'s more, locals can fill the jobs created by those projects, he adds. Currently, there is one highway linking Xinjiang and other parts of China to the east. The roads now connecting the region and China\\'s neighbors to the west cannot meet the demands of future trade. Zhang believes that without the support of transportation, becoming the trade hub on the Silk Road Economic Belt is not feasible, so Xinjiang must face the challenge head-on. The central government sees Xinjiang, which borders countries including Kazakhstan, Pakistan and Mongolia, as the key trade center on the economic belt. The economic belt, part of the Belt and Road Initiative proposed by President Xi Jinping in 2013, aims to revive the ancient trade route. Xinjiang also plans to begin research on a high-speed railway connecting Urumqi and Horgos, a land port on the China-Kazakhstan border. Additionally, Urumqi International Airport will be expanded to cope with surging domestic and international traffic.

       " ['Father of pinyin writing system dies at age 111 nan Zhou Youguang, a linguist considered the father of pinyin, a system of Latin letters for reading and writing standard Chinese, died on Jan 14 at his home in Beijing at the age of 111, one day after his birthday. In 1955, Zhou, then an economics professor at Fudan University in Shanghai, was asked by the central government to quit his job and join a national committee to develop an accessible alphabetic writing system. It took him and his colleagues three years to devise the official Romanization system, which was adopted in 1958. Since then, pinyin - which can be translated as \"spelled sounds\" - has helped to considerably increase literacy across the country, and has made it easier for foreigners to study the Chinese language. It has also facilitated the use of Chinese characters on computer keyboards and cellphones: pinyin is entered on a keyboard, and users are given a choice of characters. \"The committee\\'s work was extremely important to establishing a modern country because about 85 percent of Chinese people were illiterate when New China was founded,\" Zhou recalled in one of his many reference books. He later lectured at Peking University and Renmin University of China on linguistics. In the early 1980s, Zhou participated in a successful campaign proposing pinyin as the international standard spelling for Chinese. It is considered superior to the Wade-Giles system, developed in the 19th century and widely used until the 1980s. Zhou also worked with other scholars to translate the Encyclopedia Britannica into Chinese. \"Mr Zhou was a great scholar whose knowledge has spread from East to West,\" says Su Peicheng, a linguistics professor at Peking University. \"He was the founder of the theory of modern learning for the Chinese language.\" Zhou was born in 1906 in Changzhou, Jiangsu province, and in 1923 enrolled at the prestigious St John\\'s University in Shanghai. There, he majored in economics and also took courses in linguistics. In 1933 he went to Japan to further his economics studies, but returned to Shanghai two years later when Sino-Japanese ties became tense. After World War II ended, he worked as a banker in the United States but in 1949 he chose to return to China shortly after New China was founded. He joked about his longevity on his birthday in 2013: \"God is so busy. He has forgotten me.\" Zhou was married for nearly 70 years to Zhang Yunhe, who came from a legendary literary family in Hefei, Anhui province. Zhang died in 2002 at the age of 94. The couple had a daughter who died as a child and a son, Zhou Xiaoping, a meteorologist, who died in 2015 at age 82. wangkaihao@chinadaily.com.cn    (China Daily European Weekly 01/20/2017 page14)'],\n",
       " ['Look at history to see the future nan My recent piece of work on de-globalization and China-WTO issues was published by China Daily and picked up by Eureporter. I received lots of feedback, either favoring globalization or against Chinese social-economic-political directions and its \"fake\" stance of openness, non-discrimination, and equality.... The opponents\\' opinions are strong but I am actually very pleased to see China become the subject of discussion. It shows how much attention it has generated, which might ironically be at a similar level to that which emerged after Brexit and the Trump victory. It looks like we won\\'t be bored this century and deprived of tremendous transitions and changes. The Western world and its media, most of the time, don\\'t reflect what the real China was and is, and don\\'t understand seemingly-complicated Chinese phenomena. It is disappointing to see that many opinions from the West are influenced by the media, so that its citizens, politicians and decision-makers have been sadly misled about China\\'s comprehensive phenomena for example on the recent topic of China\\'s (non) market status on WTO regulations. Even so, I believe we should have a shot at understanding to those opinions.  As a deep believer in Buddhism and Taoism, with which most Chinese were born with and raised, discrimination is not at the root of our values. On the contrary, we value connectiveness and collectivism, cooperation and the toleration of differences. Chinese culture was not cultivated to judge others by using its own value system. Neither, I believe, do our friends in the West. However, it does not always appear to be so. Why is that? How is it that we can share the same fundamental belief in doing the best for our people but at an institutional level we grow apart? The majority of people in the West do not have enough information on what China is and where it has been, which influences the way the country is seen and understood. Some raise the issues of freedom, equality and openness as a \"weapon\" to judge Chinese performance and its role and contribution to globalization and world prosperity. Do they understand the sacrifices and costs that China has paid? At times, those biased attitudes and opinions have been too extreme and too shallow. We were born differently and developed differently but we have the honor of co-existing on the same planet with certain rules. We need to respect the rules and continue to develop positive energy to improve things for the sake of this planet\\'s wellbeing.  Those wrongly using and supporting the concept of so called anti-discrimination and equality should open their eyes and take a step back to review the antecedents and consequences of real discrimination and inequality in some countries. Discrimination comes from inequality and should be prioritized for discussion at a global level. Why are some countries / people chosen to make rules and some countries / people chosen to be badly or unfairly treated? Why are some countries / people arrogant to order others about? We should learn to respect others and not forcibly impose our values on them. China 1,500 years ago was ruled by the Tang Dynasty and that era was its most prosperous, as the largest economic and civilization contributor to the world. Openness to the world, the embracing of variety and collaboration were default values, similar to what USA has done for the past 300 years and the EU agreed to cherish when it was set up. Discrimination was disapproved of in China\\'s Tang Dynasty and onwards. Countries trading with China were well-treated, not just as friends and partners, but as family. Prosperity was sought together and evil thoughts were fought together. However, during China\\'s Qing dynasty 300 years ago, anti-globalization and protectionism dominated and bloodily dragged the wealthy dragon back to nothing, as a nobody. People were extremely poor, without status and identity. The country was plundered and lost its dignity. The story of our shared history is cruel but true. It clearly mirrors the present and accurately predicts the future. When we look at history, the only variables for us to consider are the time and the mentality. So what does this tell us about de-globalization? How should we adjust our values, thoughts and behavior to become more responsible and moral, and create a virtuous path for the benefit of us all?

       " ['Don\\'t drag out the Blue Monday blues nan Winter weather and holiday withdrawals can exacerbate already uncertain and unpleasant times, but it won\\'t last forever If you\\'re reading this, it means you survived Blue Monday. The term was coined just over a decade ago to pinpoint the day - usually the third Monday of January - calculated to be the most depressing in the year. According to a formula credited to a British academic, bad weather, post-holiday debt and the failure to keep New Year\\'s resolutions all combine to make it the most miserable day of the year. The giveaway is that this bit of pseudoscience was first revealed in a press release from a travel company seeking to boost early bookings of summer holidays.    So, Blue Monday turns out to be just another marketing ploy, just like Black Friday or Cyber Monday or any other of those shop-till-you-drop dates that have invaded the modern calendar. Maybe that is the most depressing thing of all. Unlike those other commercial fixtures, Blue Monday is not really exportable beyond the Western world. Although many in Europe and North America will need no reminding that it is a gloomy time of the year, much of the world is basking in the sunshine. In China, 1.4 billion people are gearing up for the extended Spring Festival celebrations, the most fun part of the year. It\\'s all a matter of perspective. To quote President Xi Jinping quoting Charles Dickens during his speech this week at Davos: \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\" Just as the Industrial Revolution had disrupted Dickens\\' world, so economic globalization had created new problems, Xi acknowledged. But that was no reason to write it off. Sadly, however, many in the West do appear to have written it off as we risk lapsing into a chronic funk that will extend well beyond Blue Monday. With uncertainties provoked by Donald Trump\\'s election victory, Brexit in the UK and the rise of inward-looking populist parties elsewhere in Europe, it seems that everyone is in a sulk - even the winners. In the US, the victor barely scraped an approval rating of 40 percent - a historic low - just days before his inauguration. Trump\\'s characteristic reaction was to claim the poll was rigged.    In Britain, those who successfully backed the country\\'s exit from the European Union continue to groan and gripe at the merest suggestion that Brexit might be watered down. One reason for the widespread blues is that one half of the population in the US and Europe is being dragged down a populist path not of its choosing and fears the consequences. Meanwhile, the other half, who cast their votes for promised change, were in fact voting for things to stay the same, or indeed to revert to some idealized past. And nothing ever stays quite the same. It is perfectly rational for those who have lost their jobs or seen their incomes decline - in the last decade the latter includes nearly all but the 1 percent who are super-rich - to blame a system in which the winners take all. What is less rational or acceptable is to blame one\\'s ills on immigrants and foreigners and trade competitors. That is the mark of a reactionary revolution, not a progressive one. The one-percenters gathered in Davos have been hearing that vastly more jobs are currently threatened by automation and robotization than by more open foreign trade. Their challenge is to ensure that the benefits of this new industrial revolution are evenly spread. Technology can be liberating, rather than enslaving. It just has to be done right and that should be the object of voters\\' demands. In the meantime, don\\'t despair. As the days get longer and the credit card bill gets shorter, bin the happy pills, look on the bright side and count your blessings. Blue Monday is only supposed to last one day.

       " [\"Those investing overseas must consider risks nan China has transformed from a capital importing country to a capital exporting one. This is an important characteristic of the new normal of the Chinese economy. The latest statistics show China's current foreign exchange reserve is $3.05 trillion (2.87 trillion euros; 2.48 trillion), nearly $1 trillion lower than its peak in June 2014. Investing abroad has been a growing trend for both enterprises and individuals. Chinese enterprises have never been so passionate about investing in foreign capital markets, and they have become one of the largest sources of global investment. Individual investors have shown a similar desire for going out. Investments are made in overseas assets and children studying abroad. Some wealthy individuals have also sought to move their fortunes overseas in a bid to evade the yuan's depreciation. First, wealthy Chinese buy homes. Later, they buy foreign insurance products, and invest in hedge funds or foreign stock markets. Money from Chinese investors creates business opportunities for other economies. To some extent, the surge of house prices in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Australia is related to the influx of Chinese investors. Home buyers from the Chinese mainland have not only boosted these countries' property markets, they have also created jobs and promoted local economic growth. People from the mainland also buy life insurance and investment dividend-returning insurance, especially in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, which has undoubtedly given impetus to the development of the offshore financial market in Hong Kong. Currently, people can directly open accounts abroad and invest in overseas stock markets, as well as financial products for Qualified Domestic Institutional Investors. Along with the opening-up of China's capital market, individual Chinese nationals are becoming an important customer source for the wealth management industry in some economies. In this process, investors are increasing their input in overseas stock markets and funds, which undoubtedly fosters the development of financial markets in the countries concerned. In the future, exchange rate fluctuation and the decline in the return on investments at home will make more Chinese nationals want to invest abroad.    A survey of Chinese families by the Financial Times last year shows that 56.8 percent of those sampled said they would increase their overseas assets in the next two years, and investing abroad is no longer exclusive to the very rich. More and more Chinese families with a disposable income of between 600,000 yuan ($87,000; 81,300 euros; 70,000) and 6 million yuan are investing overseas. There are certainly some uncertainties and risks behind the investments. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, housing prices, tax policy changes, etc. Some foreign insurance is not protected by Chinese laws and foreign stock markets are by no means safe harbors. But the momentum of Chinese residents investing abroad will continue this year. And their capital will inject continuous vitality into overseas housing, insurance and stock markets, foster local economic growth and create jobs. Yet Brexit, Donald Trump's stepping into power as US president and the forthcoming elections in France and Germany will increase uncertainties in these markets and Chinese investors will have to pay even more attention to their risk assessments this year than before. They will need to ensure they are fully informed so they can control potential risks and make rational investment decisions. The author is a partner in the Yongshi Fund Management Company.

       " ['Famous folk can\\'t resist a tasty sound bite nan British wartime Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill was a master of the cute quote and Chinese President Xi Jinping must have won many hearts and minds at Davos when he quoted Charles Dickens: \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\" The line comes from the opening paragraph of Dickens\\'s 19th century classic, A Tale of Two Cities. Just about every British schoolboy of my generation knows that one. Xi also pitched in with a remark, which resonates in Chinese and British culture - that there\\'s no such thing as a free lunch. Churchill, of course, took over as leader of a nation fighting the fascism of Nazi Germany and his key quotes have gone into the history books.    He had nothing, he said, to offer the British people, except \"blood, toil, tears and sweat,\" adding in his characteristic growl \"we shall never surrender\". The Free French leader General Charles de Gaulle, who later became president, despaired of the antics of his fellow-countrymen - \"how can you govern a country that has 246 different kinds of cheese.\" Legendary Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping was the master of the catchphrase - his coining of the agreement covering the return to Chinese sovereignty of Hong Kong as being \"one country, two systems\" was, and remains, a masterpiece. Mao Zedong was the master of the one-line aphorism - off the top of my head I remember, \"In waking a tiger use a long stick\" and \"Women hold up half the sky.\" I guess the point here is that an experienced leader, no matter what his political persuasion, knows the power of a catchy quote. Disgraced US president Richard Nixon, seeking to justify some of his more questionable decisions while in office, once memorably declared: \"If the president does it, it is not illegal.\" He lived to regret that remark after being forced to resign in disgrace in 1974 ahead of almost certain impeachment and dismissal from office, the only president to do so. Of course, in this modern age of 24-hour news and digital information channels, the race is on for the sound bite that grabs attention. Some 43 years after I first heard it, one quote by a US Air Force major still has me flummoxed.    It was December 1972 and the US was desperate to conclude a peace deal that would extract it from the morass of the Vietnam War - Peace With Honour, as Nixon and National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger would call it. The North Vietnamese, headed by Le Duc Tho, were digging their heels in and by mid-December they refused to set a date for further talks in Paris after South Vietnamese demands, in their view, made a deal impossible. Nixon and Kissinger resorted to the old adage: \"Bomb them to the conference table.\" In an operation dubbed Linebacker II, huge US B-52 bombers blitzed targets in Hanoi and surrounding areas, killing more than 1,600 people and causing widespread damage to infrastructure. At this point, let me introduce Major Jere Forbus, an amiable officer who handled press conferences, dubbed the Five o\\'Clock Follies, in a disused movie theatre in downtown Saigon. Here\\'s the thing - time zones and mid-20th century creaky communications meant the Saigon press crowd was baying for news of the bombing campaign, which had not been officially released by the Americans. An exasperated New York correspondent stood up and said - I remember the question to this day: \"Major, you know you\\'re bombing, the North Vietnamese know you\\'re bombing, so why won\\'t you tell us?\" Came back the immortal quote from Forbus - \"That\\'s protection of information.\" It is, of course, the supreme example of the spokesman\\'s art of obfuscation. Years later, I tracked down a retired Forbus to his home in Washington. I asked him what he had meant. As genial as ever, he smiled, and said: \"I had to tell you guys something. Have another beer.\" I am still in the dark. Chris Peterson is managing editor of China Daily European Bureau. Contact the writer at chris@mail.chinadailyuk.com.

       " [\"Azerbaijan forms a key link in the Silk Road chain nan Strategically-placed nation bears witness to the huge potential of trade route linking Asian and European nations Azerbaijan, a modern south Caucasus country on the Caspian Sea - rich in oil and natural resources - is a key link in the Silk Road Economic Belt, the Chinese vision for a route connecting Asia, Europe and the rest of the world. China has huge development projects in this region, involving billions of dollars of investment and trade. In 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping put forward the Silk Road Economic Belt initiative, signifying multidirectional cooperation between Eastern and Western countries throughout Central Asia and the Caucasus region. In March 2015, China declared its Visions and Actions on Jointly Building the Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road. Azerbaijan is the pivotal point of the China-Central Asia-West Asia Economic Corridor. The country has a long history of welcoming merchants from land and sea due to its proximity to Asia and Europe since the time of the ancient Silk Road. If we look back, the first merchant route between the Roman Empire and Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 24) China emerged in the first century BC in Azerbaijan.    The Silk Road Economic Belt comprises 6 corridors which connect five central Asian countries, Iran and the Persian Gulf region, Transcaucasia, Turkey and the Saudi Arabian peninsula. Traditionally, trade between China and West Asia takes place mostly via maritime routes, and the China-Central Asia-West Asia Economic Corridor is a land-based substitute for these traditional routes. The shortest way to approach West Asia from China is via Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan was the safest of the old routes in the 5th century BC. Barda (about 250 km west of Baku) was the old capital of Azerbaijan, a trading hub on the ancient Silk Road. China is the manufacturer of the world's fastest and most luxurious trains and a rail track is already operational from Aktau and Turkmenbashi, transporting goods to the New Baku International Sea Trade Port and then westward to Turkey and Europe. In August 2015, the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route was launched; the Nomad Express, carrying goods from China's Shihezi, traveled through the port of Aktau and arrived at Baku. The North-South Transport Corridor is under construction and will connect Iran and Russia, providing road access from Indian Ocean countries to Europe and Central Asia.    China has been promoting the interconnection routes to the west of the Caspian Sea. Both China and Azerbaijan have strong links in the construction of railway tracks for transporting oil and gas. The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline is a major initiative of Azerbaijan to supply oil and gas to Georgia and countries in Europe. The Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum Pipeline is another project supplying oil and gas to satisfy the demands of Europe. Azerbaijan has signed agreements for multiple trans-Caspian international transport routes with Kazakhstan and Georgia, and even initiated the Trans Caspian transport consortium to operate the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route from China to Europe. Azerbaijan is a major supporter of the Transport Corridor Europe-Caucasus-Asia project, initiated by the EU and considered the backbone of the Silk Road. History is being repeated and the Chinese vision of One Belt One Road is getting an extraordinary response from countries along the ancient route. The Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway has been dubbed the Iron Silk Road. China has initiated the Silk Road Fund, for which Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank will allocate enormous sums for the construction of these international corridors. According to estimates, the trans-Caspian route could be transporting around 300,000-400,000 containers by 2020, bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars. Relations between China and Azerbaijan are growing fast and Azerbaijan has great potential to become a valuable partner in the Silk Road project - one of the great initiatives of the 21th century.

       " [\"Fintech will help boost real economy nan Technology will potentially provide the tonic needed to get finance and business working efficiently in the near future The latest Central Economic Work Conference of China has put boosting the real economy high on the agenda for 2017. A real economy that provides products and services is the key to a country's economic success and the finance industry should serve its development. Due to information asymmetry, security problems and restrictions on time and space, the traditional finance sector presents many barriers to serving the real economy. However, in recent years, the appearance of Fintech (financial technology) has brought new opportunities. Fintech refers to the technologies that can be used in the financial sector to help traditional companies innovate, such as the mobile internet, big data, cloud computing and the blockchain. It could help solve problems that traditional financing may have. Technology could be the main driver for financial innovation, which would then stimulate consumption and encourage the development of businesses, especially small and medium-sized companies, and then boost the development of the real economy. Financial products and services using Fintech would be more efficient and of higher quality compared with their traditional counterparts. Fintech would greatly influence some key aspects of the finance industry, such as risk, leverage and credit.    First, Fintech would make products and services safer and more efficient to support the real economy. For example, the common use of online payment tools such as Alipay and Wechat wallet, increases the efficiency of transactions and lowers costs. Moreover, a financial services system based on blockchain technology will make data produced by companies more accurate. Accurate data will greatly improve the efficiency of companies' operations. Second, Fintech will improve China's economic and consumption structure. The upgrading of industrial and consumption structure is a key element in China's supply-side reform. Under the current traditional financial system, consumers face problems borrowing and companies find it difficult to get loans from banks. One report showed that in 2016 consumer credit accounted for only around 5 percent of the whole credit market, which is about 30 percent lower than the rate for developed countries. By the end of 2015, China had more than 20 million companies and 54 million self-employed entrepreneurs, but only about 10 percent of them were able to get loans from the banks. Fintech provides a solution to this. In the individual consumption sector, credit instruments have become quite commonly used. For example, internet retail giant JD.com has launched an online financial service which allows consumers to borrow money for purchases and, if they pay it back within 30 days, pay no interest. For companies, there are many peer-to-peer lending platforms emerging in China, which are based on big data. With Fintech, these p2p platforms could collect money from individuals and then lend to companies and individuals, based on an evaluation of their information, which would also increase the quality and efficiency of financial activities. In the end, Fintech would provide a better way of avoiding risk, which is important to the stable development of financial activities. The application of big data in the financial industry will make it easier to develop reliable risk control systems, which could supplement more traditional risk control systems based on the financial reports. If a company is likely to commit financial fraud, big data from online transactions, payments and other related issues could predict such a situation. This could help improve the financial institutions' ability to assess default risks.

       " ['Silk Road investment to link public, private growth nan Project attracts interest as more seek to get involved in vital infrastructure development China\\'s Belt and Road Initiative became a hot talking point at the World Economic Forum in Davos, as global leaders gathered to search for new impetus of growth. This surge of interest comes at a time when the importance of infrastructure investment is increasingly obvious, despite sluggish global growth curtailing spending in advanced economies. \"It\\'s talked about so much. Businesses internationally knew about the Belt and Road Initiative but they don\\'t know how to get involved, so now discussions are focused on the details,\" says Honson To, chairman of KPMG China.   - People welcome President Xi Jinping to Davos on Jan 15. Xu Jingxing / China Daily  \"A key part of how China has developed in the last 30 years has been laying out infrastructure within the country. It\\'s a proven way. Now this concept will be exported to countries around the world with the Belt and Road Initiative,\" says To. Launched by President Xi Jinping three years ago, the initiative is now gaining momentum after receiving support from more than 100 countries and international organizations, more than 40 of which have signed cooperation agreements with China. In May this year, China will host the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing, which will \"discuss ways to boost cooperation, build cooperation platforms and share cooperation outcomes\", as President Xi highlighted in his keynote address at Davos. Summit participants welcomed the high importance Xi attached to the Belt and Road Initiative, saying it was a concrete demonstration of China\\'s leadership in globalization and inclusive growth.    Thomas Maier, managing director for infrastructure at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, says China can play a leadership role in supporting sustainable infrastructure development that is also environmentally friendly. It can also contribute to the development of a global system where the government leads infrastructure investment and encourage private sector investors to follow suit. Those values which EBRD champions are also coherent with the philosophy of the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which pledges to operate with a \"lean, clean and green\" model, meaning long-term, sustainable infrastructure will get priority for funding. In June 2016 AIIB and EBRD agreed to jointly commit a total of $55 million to upgrade a key section of the motorway connecting Tajikistan with Uzbekistan, which is also one of AIIB\\'s first projects. Maier says another crucial way China contributes to the global infrastructure system is through funding provided by its large commercial banks. He also applauds Chinese companies\\' export of important environmentally friendly infrastructure and technology to countries along the Belt and Road. So far Chinese companies have invested more than $50 billion in projects in those countries. Lord Mark Malloch-Brown, former United Nations deputy secretary-general, says that the AIIB\\'s ability to deploy capital, especially from the private sector, is impressive and an inspiration for the way multinational development banks could function. \"AIIB\\'s capital commitment is able to attract private sector money because its agenda is closely aligned with the Chinese government\\'s emphasis on China becoming an important trading nation,\" says Malloch-Brown, who is also chairman of the non-profit group the Business and Sustainable Development Commission.

Chan plays an archeologist who seeks a lost treasure using an ancient map in the action-comedy Kung Fu Yoga. The movie, one of three Sino-Indian coproductions being made as a result of an agreement between the two countries, will be released on Jan 28, the first day of the Chinese Lunar New Year.   - The upcoming Sino-Indian coproduction Kung Fu Yoga features (clockwise from top left) Hong Kong action star Jackie Chan and Indian actress Disha Patani; veteran Indian actor Sonu Sood and Hong Kong actor and singer Aarif Lee. Photos Provided to China Daily  The film\\'s trailer, featuring the lion \"passenger\", which was released on Jan 5, has garnered millions of clicks on major video-streaming sites, making Kung Fu Yoga one of the most-anticipated films of the profitable Spring Festival holiday. Chan, who has starred in more than 100 films and been involved in at least another 100, is very popular globally for his unique blend of action and comedy. But this forthcoming title is more than just another Chan-style action comedy. In September 2014, China and India signed a groundbreaking agreement on coproducing films, in a bid to bring the two major movie powerhouses together. It yielded results in May the following year, when China\\'s State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, and the Indian embassy in China announced plans for three joint productions. Kung Fu Yoga is one of the three films. The other two are a biographical feature, Xuan Zang, based on a seventh-century monk\\'s pilgrimage to India, and Buddies in India, comedian Wang Baoqiang\\'s directorial debut. Xuan Zang was released in April and Buddies in India will also premiere during the upcoming Spring Festival. Of the three films, Chan\\'s movie is expected to make an impression in India as the star\\'s early Hollywood blockbusters - Rumble in the Bronx (1995) and Rush Hour (1998) - made him a well-known name in the country. Also, Chan\\'s profile in India was boosted when his 2005 fantasy epic The Myth was filmed there. Disha Patani, an Indian actress in the film, says: \"In India, most young people have grown up watching Chan\\'s action movies. He is very famous in India. For me, it\\'s like a dream come true to work with him.\" The popularity of Chan\\'s action films means that many Indians believe most Chinese can perform martial-arts stunts like the actor, says Amyra Dastur, an India model-actress who also has a role in the film. Both the actresses - Patani, who plays an Indian professor assisting Chan, and Dastur, who plays her sister - say that the film is their first Chinese-language movie. The movie also features veteran actor Sonu Sood, who has starred in more than 60 Bollywood productions. As for the commercial prospects of the film, Chinese filmmakers believe it will make a splash in both markets. \"Kung fu is a symbol of China, just like yoga is of India,\" says Stanley Tong, the Hong Kong director who helped make Chan famous in Hollywood. The new film sees them teaming up again after Rumble in the Bronx, Police Story 4: First Strike and CZ12. Speaking about the challenges faced in making the movie, Tong says: \"It is a bit difficult to mix two cultures. I read a lot of ancient books, especially on cultural communication in the Tang Dynasty (AD 618-907), which inspired me.\"    Giving details on the other aspects of the movie, Tong says the film features scenes shot in Iceland and Dubai. Most of Chan\\'s action films offer visual feasts. \"My job was to make this (action film) more creative and different.\" Also, using his personal connections with Dubai\\'s royal family, Tong borrowed several animals, including the lion, from them, besides some very expensive sports cars. For Chan, however, the movie is all in a day\\'s work. \"I love to be on a film set. It\\'s my amusement park. I always have new ideas and realize my dreams when I am there,\" the 62-year-old says. On set, Chan is said to always lead by example, whether doing stunts, choreography or just being environmentally aware. Seeing Chan picking up discarded bottles and using paper towels sparingly on set was an eye-opener for the two Indian actresses. Meanwhile, Jonathan Shen, founder of Shinework Media, one of the film\\'s Chinese producers, says the movie will enhance links between Chinese and Indian filmmakers. He says that the film will be released in around 500 cinemas in India. xufan@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/20/2017 page1)'],\n",
       " [\"Just what Europe wanted to hear nan Since Jan 17 media attention has been monopolized by the annual World Economic Forum, which brings together leaders in politics, business, economics, technology and society. This year the main topic discussed was how to promote responsible and responsive leadership. As shown by recent voting, the gap between political leaders and civil society has never been as important as it is today. Digital media are providing key instruments for reducing the gap. Politicians and business leaders have embraced Twitter in order to stay in touch with their constituents, turning them into followers. But Twitter is only the tip of an iceberg. Social media, connected devices and big data will provide a better match between the expectations of voters and customers on one side and those of political and business leaders on the other. A few weeks ago, the Las Vegas' Consumer Electronics Show (CES) once again offered a showcase for new digital opportunities in this area. Leading telecom vendor ZTE presented its new 'Hawkeye' smartphone, which resulted from its innovative crowdsourcing project to develop a phone based on consumer choices. Last year, ZTE started collecting ideas from the Android community about the future smartphone they would like to see on the market. Future users chose from phones with five core features, such as eye-tracking, self-adhesive back, waterproof VR mask functions, and the ZTE is now in mass production thanks to the success of crowd-sourcing. Empowerment of the consumer is the future. In the same vein, WeChat, the messaging service of Chinese tech giant Tencent, is taking a big step to liberate smartphone users from the need to compare and download apps from Google Play or the App Store. The main features normally obtained via apps are now available inside the messaging service via so-called mini-programs, allowing users to make payments, book a taxi, order food, book tickets, etc. The days of apps may be numbered. It isn't just luck that these major innovations came from China. A total of 1,575 Chinese companies exhibited in Las Vegas, one third of the total number of exhibitors, second only to the US. These numbers illustrate the increased contributions of China to the global economy, not only in terms of innovation but also as an engine of economic growth. Today, China is progressively translating this economic power into political influence. This was highlighted by media coverage of the keynote speech given by President Xi Jinping on Jan 17, due not only to the fact that it was the first appearance of a Chinese head of state at Davos, but mainly because of his clear messages. In his strong defense of globalization, President Xi claimed that the only way to ensure growth and productivity is to work hand-in-hand to improve global governance and make it more inclusive. The president confirmed his country's firm commitment to pursuing an enabling environment for foreign investments, boosting domestic consumption, developing advanced manufacturing and striving to maintain the positive momentum of the Chinese economy, which has contributed as much as 30 percent to annual global growth since the financial crisis. Xi's message will have been music to the ears of the large delegation from the EU - 12 commissioners out of 28 - in Davos. With the French and German elections in sight, a major challenge for the Eurozone is to deliver growth. Forecasts see growth in the Eurozone slowing slightly in 2017, after coming in at an expected 1.6 percent in 2016. Forecasts for 2018 are not much better: GDP growth is predicted to stagnate at 1.5 percent in 2018. At the same time, the Chinese economy is expected to grow at 6.5 percent in 2017. EU leaders are looking east, particularly now that the incoming Trump administration is bringing substantial uncertainties about future EU-US and US-China trade relations. The EU has much to offer China. First, there is a stable and predictable trade policy framework determined by the EU Commission under the active leadership of Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom, who attended the Davos Forum, explaining the opportunities offered by the EU's trade policy to the top Chinese business leaders who were present. These included Alibaba's Chairman Jack Ma, China Telecom's Chairman Yang Jie, Baidu's Chairman Zhang Yaqin and HTC's Chairwoman Cher Wang. Second, there are lucrative investment opportunities. Think of the recent acquisition of German robotics maker Kuka by China's Midea. The EU's innovative companies allow China to fill technology gaps and strengthen its emerging global digital leadership. On the initiative of Jyrki Katainen, European Commission vice-president for jobs, growth, investment and competitiveness, the EU has launched a practical operational website allowing any company in the world to find investment projects in the EU, including its digital sector - the European Investment Project Portal - with, for the moment, a list of 139 promising projects. President Xi made clear that isolationism is not part of his country's policy. Let us now work together to implement this policy, bring together Chinese and EU business and start building together our common future.

       " [\"China's philosophy of mutual benefits coherent with Davos nan President Xi Jinping calls for open and inclusive growth in the World Economic Forum The world is now at a crucial juncture, facing either progress with globalization or retreat into protectionism, and Chinese President Xi Jinping's call for open and inclusive growth in Davos this week came like a breath of fresh air, injecting new confidence into global economic relations. One can really feel the power of his messages in Davos, where his words remained a hot talking point throughout the week of the forum. President Xi spoke about market-driven growth, free trade, environmental sustainability and fostering win-win partnerships globally. With those messages, China is stepping into its newfound role as a global leader, filling in a vacuum once occupied by the US. Despite leading the world's largest economy, President Donald Trump and his administration have shown protectionist tendencies, driven by voters who feel left out of the benefits of globalization. Under this context, President Xi's advocacy for free trade became more important, and is yet another reflection of the Chinese ancient philosophy of mutual benefit and win-win partnerships, which have shaped the country's way of thinking for thousands of years. Philosophy aside, China's development is itself an apt reflection of the benefits of globalization. When China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, it felt worried that multinationals' entrance into China would lead to severe unemployment. But this fear was soon appeased, as many Chinese firms became more vibrant and competitive due to globalization. Industries with few trade barriers, like technology, benefited the most from globalization, while those receiving government protection still experienced great inefficiencies, such as the energy sector. Over the years, China has not only benefited from globalization but also contributed to other countries' wealth and prosperity. As China's manufacturing sector grew and it became the world's factory, consumers in Western countries enjoyed more wealth and consumption. More importantly, manufacturing jobs' shift to China freed up the labor market in advanced economies like the US, allowing them to focus more on high-end services for which profit margins are much higher. Meanwhile, China's economic growth has created an expanding middle class whose consumption power is now having a huge influence on the world. Consider the record number of Chinese tourists and students going abroad to advanced economies like the US, allowing them to export products without physically shipping them overseas. But the story does not end here, because globalization is not just about trade, it is also the exchange of ideas and building of platforms. When Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg visited China's technology giant Tencent for learning and inspiration, Tencent welcomed him with open doors. Many Chinese firms expanding overseas are bringing Western businesses into their existing ecosystems, helping them to access the Chinese market. E-commerce giant Alibaba is now helping many US brands to sell to Chinese buyers through its cost-effective e-commerce logistics channels. Through this integration of ideas, channels and platforms in our increasingly connected global economy, Chinese businesses are becoming more globally-oriented and creating jobs in international markets. Just this month, Alibaba's founder Jack Ma promised one million jobs to the US when he met with President Trump. Home appliance manufacturer Hisense, which has built a factory in Mexico, now conducts much of its research and development in international markets. Chinese firms are becoming increasingly global, and Chinese business leaders' presence at Davos is rapidly expanding. China is the focus of discussions across a diverse range of sessions at the forum. Chinese CEOs are increasingly confident and articulate. Dalian Wanda's founder Wang Jianlin grabbed media headlines when he urged the US to keep its market open and refrain from protectionist tendencies. China's business leaders, like Wang, are becoming increasingly unafraid to voice their views. As the world is trying to get back on its feet and find new sources of growth and new directions for development, China's advocacy for globalization seems to have offered a version of a solution. But China also needs to realize that actions speak louder than words, and the world is watching to see how China translates President Xi's commitments into concrete policies. China needs to strengthen its credibility by further opening up its borders to international trade and investment partners, according to the president's promise, and perhaps inspire other global leaders to follow its lead in building a more inclusive world.

       " ['US could lose its imaginary war nan Trump\\'s hostile language and protectionist promises could condemn his nation to miss out on trade opportunities Many like to borrow military expressions in describing business competition, a hot one being \"trade war\". Some say Donald Trump, the new US president, may think himself a contemporary General Patton, a warrior in trade. And the anticipated trade war would be Trump\\'s main theater. In response, some Chinese commentators recommend their readers go back to the nation\\'s 2,000-year-old Art of War by Sun Tzu to find defense methods. The fact is - and it is an important fact - that seeing trade in terms of war has never been a smart thing to do. Business is not a war. The biggest difference between business competition and a war is the simple fact that all wars end. No matter how bad a war is, there is a day when one side prevails, and peace is restructured.    But in business, competition goes on. Its logic doesn\\'t recognize an \"end\" so long as a company doesn\\'t break up by itself. In the long run, there is no specific enemy. The more a company grows, the more it will find competition a market-wide challenge, joined by rivals large and small, known and unknown. Nor can it be possible for any triumph, however celebrated, to result in a monopoly as clear and solid as the status of a superpower in the geopolitical sense. This is why the victory of Apple\\'s iPhone over Nokia was not a victory for the whole market. It still faces competition from many other players in the market, and any small mistake may cost its market share in the world. As for trade war, there is only one way in which it can make sense. That is when it is used no more than a trade embargo - to serve not a business purpose, but a political purpose. Even when trade is being used for a political purpose, the user will have to take a few precautions to control the possible damage on its own economic goals, making sure the target is a weaker and less productive economy, that the policy has worldwide support, and that the goods affected by the policy will be high in strategic importance but limited in number. This being the case, the grand trade war that Trump and his lieutenants may be planning is a rather unconventional one. It will be used to serve not a specific political purpose, but an economic agenda which, paradoxically, is touted as \"making America great again\".    If the incoming administration does what it has declared, it will wage a trade war on all imported goods from China, if not from the rest of the world. That would certainly be unprecedented in history. But will it work? It won\\'t. Apart from its enormous size and complex, often multilateral details, there are two things on the macro-economic level to challenge the very logic of a trade war. First, global market will continue to develop even if the United States no longer wants to play a leading part in it. The size of world trade is nowadays more than eight times that of 1980, before president Ronald Reagan took office. In Reagan\\'s time, the biggest trade challenge to the US was presented by Japan. Now, China and many other developing countries with a general wage level much lower than that of Japan, can produce things almost as well as American workers. There are millions of such workers throughout Southeast Asia and India. Their manufacturing capabilities are attested by the fact that trade among developing countries has now grown larger than trade between developed and developing countries in value, and is close in size to the trade among all developed countries. In recent years, China\\'s trade with ASEAN countries has been on a more rapid increase than its trade with the US. Developing countries can continue to trade with one another and are likely to yield more shared opportunities despite the one-sided trade war waged by the US. Second, assuming the so-called Trumponomics works and 25 million new jobs are created within a few years in a protected environment, the US will still have to rely on the international market to sell the new workers\\' products, which can\\'t all be consumed at home. Unless Trump is determined to permanently shut the US down to the world market to follow a path of Stalinist self-sufficiency, his administration will still have to seek mutually-beneficial trade policies with foreign countries, especially with Asia, where the world\\'s largest group of new middle-class consumers is. Chinese President Xi Jinping told his audience in Davos, Switzerland, that in the coming five years, China\\'s development is expected to generate a demand for $8 trillion of imports, $600 billion of inbound investments and $750 billion of outbound investments. Those waging of a trade war with China can\\'t afford to miss out on these rich opportunities. The author is editor-at-large of China Daily.

       " ['A breath of fresh air nan Global leaders take heart from President Xi\\'s stance on free trade at Davos Forum Global leaders once again gathered in the snowy Swiss Alpine resort of Davos this week to find new drivers for economic growth in 2017 - and they seem to have taken encouragement from China\\'s advocacy for openness and free trade. For the first time ever, the World Economic Forum was attended by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who gave a keynote address vigorously defending free trade. It was applauded by political and business leaders as a rich symbol of China taking the lead in global issues, reflecting this year\\'s forum theme of \"responsive and responsible leadership\".    \"There is no point in blaming economic globalization for the world\\'s problems because that is simply not the case,\" Xi said on Jan 17. The four-day forum ended on Jan 20 and was attended by 3,000 delegates. Offering his suggestions for new sources of growth, Xi stressed the need to develop a dynamic innovation-driven growth model, which leads to win-win cooperation, fair and equitable governance and balanced, equitable and inclusive development. Klaus Schwab, executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, praises Xi\\'s address, saying his commitment is crucial \"to the innovative, open and inclusive world.\" \"We\\'re living in a global, interdependent world and we cannot recreate artificial borders. Globalization is a win-win situation and we have a common destiny as humankind,\" Schwab says. He acknowledges the \"Chinese Dream\" initiated by Xi while calling for a \"Global Dream\", a dream of a world that remains innovative, open and fair. The World Economic Forum in Davos, founded 47 years ago, has made a name for itself as both a gathering for global elites and an incubator of new ideas, but this year China\\'s strong participation made it special. \"Xi\\'s remarks come at a critical juncture in history,\" says Danae Kyriakopoulou, head of research at the think tank Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum. \"The US and the UK, once the champions of economic liberalism and the proponents of globalization, are retreating from the world stage and from integration with their neighbors. In this context, Xi\\'s speech was a refreshing showcase of his leadership on the world stage,\" Kyriakopoulou says.    Xi\\'s speech comes at a time when sluggish economic growth in the West has led to signs of protectionist measures. Populist leaders have been taking advantage of the dissatisfaction of those left behind by globalization. US President Donald Trump, who did not attend the forum due to his inauguration, pledged during his election campaign to pull out of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership. Meanwhile, the UK is experiencing Brexit-related uncertainties after the British public voted to leave the European Union in a 2016 referendum. Aside from Xi\\'s address, China\\'s representation at Davos this year is unprecedented. Insightful sessions by Chinese entrepreneurs like Dalian Wanda\\'s Wang Jianlin and Alibaba\\'s Jack Ma have been hugely popular. The interest is easy to understand, especially considering Alibaba made history as the largest Initial Public Offering on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014. Dalian Wanda made headlines in 2016 with the $3.5 billion (3.2 billion euros; 2.8 billion) purchase of production house Legendary Entertainment, becoming the first Chinese company to own a major American film company. Chinese firms are shaping and shaking the world economy, but so are many China-initiated trends and concepts. China\\'s Belt and Road Initiative, China\\'s outward direct investment, Chinese firms\\' globalization and China\\'s middle-class consumers are hot topics repeatedly featured at panel discussions this year. Perhaps China is now inseparable from the global economy. \"China advances on all fronts and no longer hesitates to propose its own models, its own values,\" says Andre Loesekrug-Pietri, founder and managing partner of ACapital, a private equity fund. Three years after Xi proposed the Belt and Road Initiative, which seeks to increase Europe and Asia\\'s trade and investment relationships through improved infrastructure, it has received support from more than 100 countries and international organizations. More than 40 countries and international organizations have signed cooperation agreements with China, and Chinese companies have made more than $50 billion of investment, spurring the economic development of these countries and creating many local jobs. The China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is introducing a new model for multinational development banks. \"What\\'s striking about the AIIB is its ability to deploy lots of capital, especially by pulling capital from the private sector. In scale and ambition, many older generation multinational development banks can learn from it,\" says Lord Mark Malloch-Brown, former United Nations deputy secretary-general. As China increasingly plays an important economic role internationally, the country is also opening up and liberalizing its domestic market - a comment Xi reiterated at Davos. In 2016, the Chinese government significantly increased foreign access to its domestic bond and stock markets. The internationalization of the renminbi, marked by its inclusion in the International Monetary Fund\\'s basket of special drawing rights currencies, is seen as a great contribution to global financial stability. \"Increased usage of the renminbi in global trade transactions and as a reserve currency by central banks in a number of developed and developing economies will, in time, reduce vulnerability to bouts of US dollar strength,\" says Phyllis Papadavid, a senior research fellow of the Overseas Development Institute think tank. \"The renminbi\\'s inclusion in SDR and its growing internationalization is a reflection of China\\'s ongoing financial deepening and expansion. Chinese policymakers are likely to continue to set the conditions for further financial and economic liberalization,\" Papadavid says.    But China\\'s international leadership is not just reflected in economic issues, as Davos participants highlight. Helen Hai, a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, says China can take a leadership role in achieving sustainable development goals, especially by sharing with other developing countries its own lessons in industrialization and poverty reduction. \"I\\'m so glad to see such huge participation from China this year at Davos. China has made significant contributions in the Millennium Development Goals, it achieved the biggest poverty reduction globally and, going forward, China is going to tell the world how it has transformed itself,\" Hai says. Last year the Chinese government released plans aiming to lift all of China\\'s poor, by current standards, out of poverty by 2020, 10 years ahead of the schedule set by the UN sustainable development goals. To help other developing nations achieve their targets, China also pledged aid through the China-initiated assistance fund for South-South Cooperation and the China-UN Peace and Development Fund. Business leaders also warmly welcomed China\\'s continued commitment to the Paris climate accord on reducing carbon emissions. In September 2015, China announced its aim to hit peak CO2 emissions by around 2030 and slash emissions per unit of the GDP by 60-65 percent from the 2005 level. \"China\\'s voice (at Davos) is urgently needed,\" says Tom Szaky, CEO of TerraCycle, a US recycling technology firm, explaining Davos can help China develop important and timely alliances with businesses and non-government organizations on environmental issues. \"China is taking the lead in terms of investing in a more sustainable future through changes in energy, waste and other consumer patterns,\" Szaky says. Despite optimism over talk of growth at Davos, many challenges still exist for global growth in 2017, perhaps further highlighting the importance of China\\'s contribution. Papadavid of ODI says she sees continued sluggish growth in the global economy as heightened political uncertainty in the US, Europe and the UK could reduce investment intentions, while protracted weakness in commodities is likely to reduce trade growth, especially in emerging and developing countries. \"China\\'s economic transformation will be important. The emergent strength in China\\'s household sector is likely to provide a stimulus to global growth,\" Papadavid says. In his advocacy for globalization, Xi stressed that China has not only benefited from economic globalization but also contributed to it. He explained that rapid growth in China has been a sustained, powerful engine for global economic stability and expansion, while the inter-connected development of China with a large number of other countries has made the world economy more balanced. The numbers speak for themselves. In the coming five years, Xi said, China is expected to import $8 trillion-worth of goods, attract $600 billion of foreign investment and make $750 billion of outbound investment. Chinese tourists will make 700 million overseas visits. China\\'s contribution to global economic growth and its unprecedented participation at Davos have highlighted the country\\'s growing international leadership. \"There is a vacuum when it comes to global economic leadership and Xi Jinping is clearly aiming to fill it,\" says former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt. cecily.liu@mail.chinadailyuk.com   Â\\xa0 President Xi Jinping delivers the keynote speech at the World Economic Forum on Jan 17 in Davos, Switzerland.

HMD Global, which owns rights to use Nokia\\'s brand on mobile phones, recently announced its first smartphone, the Nokia 6, to target Chinese consumers. It will be released exclusively in China through internet retail giant JD.com early this year.

The new device will run on Google\\'s Android system with a 13.97-centimeter screen, and featuring 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage.

       " ['Riding out the perfect storm nan Lloyd\\'s sees written premiums on China platform more than doubling in 2016 What Lloyd\\'s of London chairman John Nelson sees is a \"perfect storm\" facing the global insurance market. He says exceptionally low interest rates and an excessive amount of capital in the insurance sector are driving down both investment returns and premiums for insurers. Nelson also notes the rapid development of technology, which has also increased competition in markets by changing the relationship between insurers and their customers.   - John Nelson, chairman of Lloyd\\'s of London. Getty Images  Lloyd\\'s of London, the world\\'s oldest market for specialty insurance and reinsurance, is responding with a strategy known as Vision 2025, according to Nelson. One of the highlights of the strategy is international expansion. Central to that is China, which will remain one of the most important frontiers for the institution as it continues to evolve from its start in a coffeehouse in London dealing in marine insurance in the 17th century to a global marketplace where more than 200 insurance brokers come to pool and spread risks. Nelson spoke recently with China Daily about the insurance market\\'s strategy and its plans in China. The following are edited excerpts from the interview: How do you see the growth potential of the Chinese insurance sector and what opportunities are there for Lloyd\\'s? Over the last few years China has become an extremely important platform for the Lloyd\\'s market. In Shanghai and in Beijing, we now have over half of the Lloyd\\'s managing agents physically present on the platform - 31 to be precise. We have increased our business substantially on this platform to 792 million yuan ($114 million; 107.7 million euros; 92 million) in gross written premiums in 2015, and we are confident we will surpass 2 billion for the past year. We continue to see China as perhaps the most important growth market in the long term for Lloyd\\'s. Insurance can provide vital support and protection, allowing Chinese companies to offset risks and focus on growing their businesses. In particular, Lloyd\\'s has the specialist expertise for the sorts of large construction, energy, marine and transport projects that this country is investing in. As a platform for international expansion, Lloyd\\'s provides a really good springboard for Chinese insurers wanting to develop their international strategies. For example, China Reinsurance Group has joined the Lloyd\\'s platform. We also signed a memorandum of understanding with China Taiping Reinsurance in October. I think these things take time and that global carriers from China coming onto the Lloyd\\'s platform will increase. How do you plan to further expand your presence in China? Our Shanghai hub opened in 2007, and two years ago we opened a branch in Beijing, which brought us closer to the major reinsurance market. We have about nine managing agents on that platform and I am very pleased with the progress. I think the main next step is to reinforce what we have already done. We\\'ve got the core of the market here. Now the challenge for the participants is to increase penetration in specialist lines. We are looking at new forms of distribution and are trying to get these specialist lines more into the veins and arteries of the Chinese economy. How can Lloyd\\'s specialties and services meet the need for more sophisticated insurance products amid China\\'s ongoing process of urbanization? Increasing urbanization is in one sense making the economy more efficient and more interconnected. But in another sense, it is concentrating risks, and the consequences are obviously more relevant if you have greater urbanization. China is a classic example of a country that continues to rapidly urbanize. The movement of people from the countryside to the cities is making economies more efficient, but also making them more vulnerable to systemic shock. What we are seeing is that the risk from natural catastrophes is increasing, but also man-made risks such as cyberattacks. What role can Lloyd\\'s play in China\\'s Belt and Road Initiative? The initiative will deepen trade ties between China and Europe and secure the future prosperity of generations to come in areas of the developing world. And it has the power to reshape the economic landscape, just as the original Silk Road did before it. It will also provide new development opportunities for Chinese insurers\\' international operations as well as global reinsurers, with them providing capacity and global expertise.    And just as Lloyd\\'s was the backstop behind early maritime trade and the transport innovations that subsequently transformed our world, so we are ready to partner with Chinese insurers to provide solutions to support and protect China\\'s economic growth and Chinese business interests abroad. How do you intend to attract more capital from Chinese insurers to Lloyd\\'s platform after forming partnerships with two of China\\'s reinsurance firms? I think over the next five to 10 years, you will see a number of additional Chinese carriers coming onto the platform. We want the process to be gradual and don\\'t want see people rushing at making a commitment. There is no point for the Lloyd\\'s market in a carrier coming on just for capital. What we want is to make sure it is broadening our footprint and business. We are also very keen to diversify the nationality base of the people on the Lloyd\\'s platform. So if a carrier wants to come on to the Lloyd\\'s platform, we are very keen that they put some of their best people into their Lloyd\\'s business. We think that having Chinese people on the Lloyd\\'s platform will massively increase the expertise in the market. China has established an insurance exchange in Shanghai with the ambition to develop its own insurance market. What does this mean for Lloyd\\'s? This is where I think Lloyd\\'s can help. We can bring expertise to the new products and we can do that through reinsurance and by backing up domestic insurers. Also, diversifying reinsurance risks outside the country can help the domestic economy. So in other words, having a liberal insurance market is very important. The Shanghai Insurance Exchange is in its early days. We are supportive of it and we have agreed to become a member of it. It will be very interesting to see how it develops. What is the biggest challenge for Lloyd\\'s to navigate in the Chinese insurance market? I think one of the biggest challenges is assessing risks in China. As the economy changes, there is a lack of data and a lack of history. In other countries, we have got good quality data which allow us to model risks more accurately. As time goes on, that will improve in China. But at the moment it is still somewhat difficult as it is at a fairly early stage of development. As times passes, we will be able to collect the data and it will become easier for us to model the risk. How would you define your management philosophy at Lloyd\\'s?

       " ['China bids to lure more investment nan Government procurement contracts to be open to bids by overseas companies if the products they offer are locally made China will lure more foreign direct investment by allowing international companies to bid on government procurement contracts - as long as their products are made in China, according to Vice-Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen. At a news conference in Beijing on Jan 6, Wang said the government had noticed that China\\'s ability to attract foreign direct investment has been challenged in recent years by a number of factors, including the cost advantages of domestic production. Additionally, nearby countries have been taking their own steps to entice more foreign investment to their shores.    \"Some neighboring countries have already begun to offer more favorable policies to gain FDI to compete with China,\" he said. \"Many developed countries are also encouraging their manufacturing businesses to move back to their home markets to boost jobs and taxes.\" Wang\\'s comments follow the State Council\\'s approval of a document last month that aims to make the process for FDI more direct, fair, open and efficient. The document outlined the steps required to give foreign capital more market access to the country\\'s services sector - including reviews of account auditing, financial institutions, share brokerages, fund management, telecommunications, internet, culture and education. The opening of opportunities in rail transportation, one of China\\'s pillar manufacturing sectors, is also included to stimulate market competition. Wang said international companies can still remit their revenues overseas or add new investments anytime. He said China\\'s recent moves to tighten controls on capital outflows was targeting only illegal activities and was temporary. Profits earned by international groups based on the Chinese mainland - as well as companies from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan in the manufacturing sector - grew by 10.8 percent year-on-year to 1.5 trillion yuan ($216.8 billion; 205 billion euros; 175.4 billion) between January and November 2016. Li Guo, vice-minister of the General Administration of Customs, says the customs service will further simplify port clearance procedures; and it will also encourage more innovation in trade processing and more special customs-control areas to support both China\\'s FDI and foreign trade activities. Li says the central government is allowing local governments to set their own policies to attract FDI within their statutory powers, based on their own economic development characteristics. zhongnan@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page29)'],\n",
       " ['Young, diverse, innovative and female nan Expert says Chinese companies in UK that allow local autonomy tend to be most successful The fastest-growing Chinese-owned companies in the United Kingdom come in all shapes and sizes - although a look at the executives reveals that they do share some things in common. Boards are typically gender diverse, younger and willing to work alongside local management to enhance innovation, according to the authors of a new report released by accountancy firm Grant Thornton. The Grant Thornton Tou Ying Tracker 2016, produced in collaboration with China Daily, is a compilation of the 30 fastest-growing Chinese-owned firms in the UK. At Chinese state-owned enterprises on the list, 12 percent of board members in the UK are female. The boards of private Chinese-owned companies in Britain are 6 percent female. Both levels compare favorably with the 5.6 percent of board positions occupied by women at companies listed in the FTSE 250 Index. Three companies in particular stand out for their gender diversity. Four of 13 board members at ICBC Standard Bank are women; two women sit on telecom giant Huawei\\'s seven-strong board; and Bank of China subsidiary China Bridge Group has an all-female board.  The board members at fast-growing Chinese-owned companies in the UK are also younger on average than their British counterparts. In the UK, the average age of nonexecutive directors is 59; for executives it\\'s 52. The average age of board members across the companies on the Grant Thornton list is 48. In terms of management strategy, Simon Bevan, head of the China Britain Services Group at Grant Thornton and co-author of the report, says the Chinese companies that give more autonomy to their UK entities during and after mergers or acquisitions tend to be more successful than those that govern more rigidly from afar. \"Those companies that have devolved power in order to ensure that the acquisition is well integrated are, in my experience, more successful than those that make an acquisition from China and try to run it from China,\" Bevan says. \"The ability of the people on the ground to make real-time decisions and to be more dynamic is a big factor in ensuring integration.\" Bevan points to Fosun\\'s 2015 takeover of nursery product brand Silver Cross as an example of a successful acquisition in which a Chinese company worked alongside an existing UK management team with limited interference. Eight of the 14 private companies on the 2016 list are products of the M&A process, and such deals can be expected to continue in 2017 as more Chinese companies look to go global, says Angus Knowles-Cutler, China Services Group Chairman for Deloitte. \"I think there will be even more focused M&A activity from China in Europe in 2017 - and quite a lot of it. And it\\'s going to be increasingly professional,\" Knowles-Cutler says. \"I\\'ve seen in the past year or two Chinese businesses becoming much more professional with their merger and acquisition activity in Europe. They are taking due diligence more seriously; they are increasingly making sure what they buy is a good strategic fit.\" Bevan, however, encourages Chinese companies in the UK to adhere more closely to administrative regulations, particularly as the market becomes more competitive and the Chinese presence in the UK becomes more established. \"One particularly striking thing was the high proportion of late filed accounts,\" Bevan says of the Chinese companies researched by Grant Thornton. \"Out of 280 companies, 30 percent were late in filing. It\\'s not the most important aspect of governance, but it\\'s a quantitative aspect that you can say points to the fact that there is not as strong a focus on good governance as is the ideal.\" angus@mail.chinadailyuk.com   ( China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page30)'],\n",

Alibaba Executive Chairman Jack Ma met US president-elect Donald Trump on Jan 9 and laid out the e-commerce giant\\'s plan to include 1 million small and medium-sized US businesses on its websites to sell to Chinese consumers over the next five years. The Chinese company expects the initiative to create jobs as each company adds a position, an Alibaba spokesman says.   - US president-elect Donald Trump and Alibaba Executive Chairman Jack Ma speak with reporters after a meeting at Trump Tower in New York on Jan 9. Drew Angerer / Getty Images  Ma, who oversees the world\\'s largest online shopping sites, says the two shared \"ideas about how we can improve trade\". After the meeting at Trump Tower in New York, Trump told reporters: \"Jack and I are going to do some great things.\" \"We had a great meeting,\" Trump said. He called Ma \"a great, great entrepreneur, one of the best in the world, and he loves this country, and he loves China\". Ma says he thinks Trump is \"very smart\" and \"very open-minded\". Sang Baichuan, director of the Institute of International Business at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, says the meeting was a sign that the incoming Trump administration is optimistic that China\\'s burgeoning middle class will continue to consume more foreign products. China exports consumer goods in exchange for high-tech, energy, agricultural and automobile products from the United States, Sang says, adding that \"most of the trade is complementary. It isn\\'t direct competition.\" Li Gang, vice-president of the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation in Beijing, says small and medium-sized businesses in the US are keen to ship their products to China however they can, including e-commerce. \"Giant companies such as Boeing, Honeywell International or Johnson Controls will also push their government to build healthy business ties with China to compete with their European and Japanese rivals,\" Li adds. Bilateral trade between two countries totaled 3.08 trillion yuan ($445 billion; 421.9 billion euros; 365.7 billion) between January and November, dropping by 1.7 percent year-on-year, according to the General Administration of Customs. Over the next five years, the consumption demand of China\\'s domestic market will reach $10 trillion, the Ministry of Commerce forecast. That will present attractive trade and investment opportunities to global companies. The meeting with Trump is a good demonstration of Ma\\'s earlier call to use the internet to knock down trade barriers and provide small and medium-sized enterprises easier access in global commerce, says Qi Xiaozhai, head of the Shanghai Society of Commercial Economy. Alibaba already enables approximately 10 million merchants to sell to Chinese consumers, according to company data. It is considered to be responsible for creating more than 30 million jobs in China since 2003, when shopping portal Taobao was founded. The e-commerce empire envisages 40 percent of its business coming from outside China in the next decade, with a long-term goal of serving 2 billion customers globally and supporting 10 million profitable businesses. According to the 2016 Business Climate Survey conducted by AmCham China, 92 percent of respondents described bilateral relations between China and the US as positive and extremely important to their business growth in China. Vice-Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen says bilateral trade has provided huge sales revenues to manufacturers in both countries, adding that it is unlikely either party would do something to sabotage already stable business ties.

The move was designed to raise awareness of risks, as the value of bitcoin has experienced wild fluctuations. The value of each bitcoin jumped more than 14 percent on Jan 6, after hitting an all-time high of $1,180 (1,114 euros; 954) the previous day. The currency\\'s value fluctuated by more than 30 percent within the past two weeks. A statement by the People\\'s Bank of China Shanghai head office on Jan 6 called the changes in the virtual currency \"abnormal\", and said authorities are requiring the trading platform to operate in compliance with established standards. They urged the platform to probe investors\\' behavior and to rectify misbehavior. The statement said authorities would like to reaffirm that bitcoin is strictly a virtual currency that cannot be regarded as currency in circulation. Investors flocked to the bitcoin market in recent days in a bid to gain from its fast appreciation. It rose 200 percent in 2016, while analysts warned that wild fluctuations of the virtual currency\\'s price and lack of transparency of its flows may be risky. According to data of Shanghai-based BTCC, a bitcoin trading platform, more than 100 new investors started trading the virtual currency in the past three days, a fast growth compared to some 20 new investors before October in 2016. The bitcoin model limits the currency to a total of 21 million units, of which 16 million have already come into existence. The method to create new bitcoin involves complicated computer processes and has become increasingly difficult: On average no more than 7,000 new bitcoins are supplied to the market per year. \"This trend shows that the bitcoin market\\'s appeal has been rising to a new level,\" a market review by BTCC said on Jan 4. Feng Xin\\'an, a 43-year-old sales manager at Shanghai-based Maoxin Trade Ltd, says he invested 135,000 yuan ($19,515; 18,430 euros; 15,784) in the bitcoin market, as he regards bitcoin as a \"haven asset\". \"The young generation, like my son and his friends, love to pay with digital currency. Their demand for bitcoin will grow further, as I have observed,\" he says. Analysts warned that bitcoin is not a tool that guarantees yield - and especially for new investors who have limited knowledge about the history of the virtual currency\\'s prices and understanding of its nature, entering the market blindly could be risky. \"Investors should always remember that bitcoin lost more than 75 percent of its value in 2013.

The Grant Thornton Tou Ying Tracker 2016, produced in collaboration with China Daily, shows that 16 fastest-growing Chinese SOEs in the UK grew at an average rate of 146 percent in 2016, while the top 14 private firms grew at an average of 210 percent. The tracking analysis has been conducted in each of the past four years. The latest installment is the first time the authors have divided the list between SOEs and private companies. \"Private firms are becoming a more crucial part of the growth story of Chinese businesses in the UK. This also aligns with what\\'s going on in China,\" says Jon Wallis, head of China Outbound at Grant Thornton and co-author on the report. China is now publishing foreign direct investment data on a quarterly basis, he says - \"split between SOE and private\" companies. The report, which is based on accounts filed at Companies House in London by Chinese-controlled entities, says the 30 listed businesses employ 25,000 people in the UK and had a combined turnover of 9.8 billion ($11.9 billion; 11.3 billion euros) - down from 35 billion the previous year, which was largely attributed to petrochemical conglomerate Sinochem, with past turnover of 30 billion, not making this year\\'s report. Telecom giant Huawei, one of the list\\'s regulars, featured once again, after a year in which the company\\'s brand recognition in the UK increased significantly and global sales were up for a fifth consecutive year. On Jan 6, the company projected sales revenue of 178 billion yuan ($25.7 billion; 24.3 billion euros; 21.2 billion) for 2016, up by 42 percent from a year ago. A spokesman for Huawei told China Daily that mobile phones \"took off last year, so the most recent breakthrough is on the consumer side\". \"Huawei Consumer BG has achieved great breakthroughs in the European high-end market thanks to strong sales of P9 and P9 Plus.\" Of the private firms, the manufacturing and technology sectors were once again well represented, but surprise new entries in the retail and consumer industries - such as Manchester-based babywear company Brecrest Fashion - highlighted the increasingly diverse array of Chinese-controlled private companies in the UK. \"When we first started doing the tracker a few years ago, what we saw was that the bulk of the Chinese activity in the UK was government-owned - the big banks, some of the big players in energy and so on,\" says Simon Bevan, head of China Britain Services Group at Grant Thornton and co-author of the report. \"These state-owned companies between them have provided a platform, an infrastructure, for the private companies that make up the second wave of Chinese investment into the UK.\" Fourteen of the 16 SOEs in the list arose through organic growth, while mergers and acquisitions accounted for eight of the 14 private firms. Wallis says the acquisition of Brecrest follows from Chinese investment in department store House of Fraser and jewelry retailer Links of London, highlighting an emerging strategy in which Chinese companies are taking control of UK retail brands and bringing them into the Chinese domestic market. This year\\'s list was once again heavily populated by SOEs from the energy, technology and financial services sectors. Wallis says Bank of China came back \"with a bang\", having been absent from the list since 2014.  (China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page30)'],\n",
       " ['Chinese app developers come of age nan Talented people take digital world by storm as flood of creativity creates worldwide demand for software When around 2,000 enthusiastic Chinese app developers gathered for Google Inc\\'s annual conference in Beijing in December, they didn\\'t allow the subzero winter temperatures to chill their enthusiasm for the event. Suitably impressed, Scott Beaumont, president of Google Greater China, told the large audience on Beijing Google Developer Day - the biggest such event in the Asia-Pacific region - that Google \"is here to know what Chinese developers want\". The rapturous crowd cheered him on. Google\\'s internet search engine may have been out of the Chinese mainland since 2010, but Google, like other global tech giants such as Apple and Microsoft, has ambitious plans for the world\\'s largest mobile internet market. The California-based giant has launched a Chinese website for local app developers and promises help to take their products global. The developments excite Yan Peng no end. \"Finally, it\\'s here. This is the best Christmas gift for me. I couldn\\'t wait to ask for a day off to celebrate this moment,\" the Shanghai-based app developer says. Such gushing praise has been common among Chinese consumers at the launch of much-awaited gadgets like, say, the latest version of the iPhone. But China is no longer just a humongous end-user market. Apps developed in China are increasingly popular among domestic and overseas users. For instance, Clean Master, a junk-cleaning app, has over 400 million overseas users. Bigo Live, a live-streaming app, boasts 7 million monthly active users from Southeast Asian countries, all of whom came on board within three months. Apps developed in China abound these days. Call China an app-developer hub, if you will. This new facet of China is not lost on the world\\'s tech giants. \"China is now an indispensable part of the global developer community,\" says Ben Galbraith, head of product and developer relations at Google\\'s developer product group. \"Chinese developers are responsive to new technology and known for high efficiency.\" The trend started a few years back. In 2014, China nosed ahead of India in software development. Out of 18.5 million professional and amateur software developers globally, China accounted for 10 percent, while India had 9.8 percent, according to International Data Corp, the US IT consultancy. A picture of the current scene has yet to emerge, but it is reasonable to assume that the mobile internet boom and China\\'s digitalization push will likely have boosted the app-developer numbers significantly, says Sandy Shen, research director at Gartner Inc, a US-based technology research and advisory company. Sensing potential, Apple has decided to set up a research and development center in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, later this year. The US tech giant\\'s announcement came after it set up its first China R&D center in Beijing in September. The work is still on, with total cost expected to reach 300 million yuan ($44.6 million; 41 million euros; 35.1 million), including a staff of 500 employees. Shenzhen, which is an innovation hub, already houses over 100,000 developers for Apple. During his May visit to Beijing, Apple CEO Tim Cook held extensive meetings with local app developers. Apple also invested $1 billion last year in Chinese ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing. \"Chinese developers are already technologically strong, and Apple will offer more help on the marketing side to help them venture into overseas markets,\" Cook said at the time. China remains key for Apple, despite tumbling iPhone sales. That\\'s because the country beat the US to become the largest market for Apple\\'s iOS app store last year, according to App Annie, an app-tracker. In the third quarter of 2016, Chinese consumers spent $1.7 billion at the iOS app store, more than five times what they had spent just two years ago, App Annie said in an email. Encouraged, Apple organized its first-ever app developer competition in China in October, to encourage university students to work on apps. With spending rising and competition intensifying in the domestic market as a result, Chinese app developers are venturing abroad. Outbound Chinese app-developers often start with utility apps like cache cleaners, anti-virus offerings and data transfer tools, before testing the waters in the content business, which ranges from social media, live streaming and mapping to mobile payment apps. Some have already had a good start, said Wei Fangdan, CEO of BaijingApp, an online community of more than 40,000 domestic app-developers who have global aspirations. As of January 2016, they developed about 270,000 apps that were sold via Apple\\'s iOS app store. By the end of May, the app developers earned more than $7 billion - and half of that came in the past 12 months, indicating strong growth momentum. In the past two years, Chinese gaming and entertainment app developers saw a 150 percent jump in revenue from Google Play, Google said, without disclosing specific figures. The United States, Japan and South Korea are the top three overseas markets for Chinese app developers. Emerging economies such as India, Mexico and Turkey are new growth drivers, according to App Annie. Interestingly, Chinese app-developers are graduating to cutting-edge technologies like virtual reality and artificial intelligence. Perfect World, a Chinese game developer, unveiled its first VR game Subnautica in March. The game enables consumers to be immersed in a virtual sea world and play with underwater creatures. As of June 2016, the PC version of Subnautica generated more than $1 million in monthly sales. The firm is working on mobile virtual reality games. \"There is an abundance of breakthrough innovation coming from China versus the \\'me too\\' technology we saw in the past,\" says Zack Weisfeld, general manager of Microsoft Global Accelerators. In December, Microsoft said it would launch its mixed-reality headset HoloLens in China this year, so that more local developers can work on apps for the gadget. \"We believe China could be leading the world in terms of mixed reality. We are seeing more virtual reality activities here than in the United States,\" says Terry Myerson, executive vice-president of Microsoft\\'s Windows and Devices Division.

Faced with pressure from capital outflows and a further possible decline in forex reserves, the central bank also might use what is known as window guidance or jawboning - which could be indirect persuasion through market-oriented measures - both onshore and offshore to curb the market\\'s expectations of a sustained depreciation of the yuan, they say. Forex reserves fell by $41 billion (38.8 billion euros; 33.6 billion) in December from the previous month to $3.01 trillion, the lowest level since March 2011, almost hitting the $3 trillion psychological line that the central bank tolerates, as some media reports have put it. \"The current level of forex reserves is still way above what the nation needs to cope with external financial risks,\" says Zhao Qingming, an economist with China Financial Futures Exchange. A close look at the change in capital flows as shown in forex reserves data shows a slew of recent measures have taken effect, according to a report released on Jan 8 by Chinese investment bank CICC. It referrs to measures like strengthened supervision for overseas investment projects and foreign acquisitions. Capital outflows in December amounted to $30.9 billion, far lower than the $46.2 billion in November, according to the report\\'s estimate. The offshore yuan jumped 2.6 percent in two days last week, the biggest gain against the greenback since 2010. The central parity rate of the yuan strengthened against the US dollar on Jan 6 and stood at 6.8668, the highest level in over a month. Xie Yaxuan, chief economist at China Merchants Securities, says the yuan\\'s recent surge has perplexed speculators, who expected a sustained depreciation. \"It will be more costly for speculators to bet on depreciation of the yuan,\" says Xie, adding that the central bank has enough tools to choose from to curb speculative behavior if a further drop in forex reserves leads to capital flight pressures. Wang Youxin, an economist at the Institute of International Finance affiliated with the Bank of China, says apart from selling dollars in the forex market, the central bank is able to use more market-oriented approaches to curb depreciation expectations. Such measures include tightening liquidity and boosting interest rates, thus raising the opportunity costs of capital outflows. Ren Zeping, chief economist of Founder Securities, says the warming up of the domestic economy and weakening of the dollar index help create an environment for stabilizing the yuan. In the long run, the central bank may need to allow a completely free fluctuation of exchange rates to avoid a recurrence of depreciation expectations, according to Liu Jie, an economist with China Minsheng Securities. wangyanfei@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page26)'],\n",
       " ['Subsidy cut puts brakes booming on car sales nan China\\'s passenger vehicle sales last year saw their fastest growth since 2013, but analysts say the momentum will not continue this year. Statistics from the China Passenger Car Association showed that dealers sold 23.9 million sedans, SUVs and MPVs in 2016, a 15.9 percent rise year-on-year, more than double the estimates of several industry organizations, including the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, made at the start of the year. Cui Dongshu, secretary-general of the CPCA, says the performance was mainly due to a 50 percent tax cut on cars with engines no larger than 1.6 liters, and Chinese motorists\\' enthusiasm for SUVs. The role of the tax cut was particularly obvious in December, which saw the year\\'s highest monthly sales of 2.76 million cars as people rushed to dealerships before the policy expired by the end of the year. Yale Zhang, managing director of research firm Automotive Foresight, says: \"The policy was like a huge roadside billboard for the car industry, constantly reminding people that there are some models they should consider buying.\"    Despite the authorities putting in place a 25 percent tax cut for this year, this will still mean that customers have to pay an extra 5,000 yuan ($710; 673 euros; 583) for models priced at around 200,000 yuan, such as the Volkswagen Sagitar or Toyota Camry. SUV sales grew 43.6 percent year-on-year in 2016, the fastest-growing segment in the market. One example of their popularity was that Great Wall Motor Co Ltd sold 80,495 Haval H6 SUVs in December, which means one was sold in every 33 seconds. More than 580,000 H6 were sold in the year. But experts say that the growth rate will plummet now that a huge number of customers have finished purchases in advance and overall economic growth is somewhat slowing down. Cui expects the figure to fall to around 6.5 percent in 2017 while Zhang and John Zeng, managing director of LMC Automotive Consulting (Shanghai), give an even less optimistic estimate of 2 to 3 percent for the year. Zeng says the market would see negative growth without the 25 percent tax cut on small engine cars that took effect this month. However, Zeng is against too much stimulus, insisting that the market should have the final say. He says the favorable policies are like athletes using drugs that produce abnormally high but unsustainable performances. lifusheng@chinadaily.com.cn    (China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page25)'],\n",
       " ['Chinese writers make global splash nan Garnering many awards, literature from the mainland left a lasting impression on the international stage last year Chinese novels came of age in 2016, bagging many international awards. Children\\'s writer Cao Wenxuan won the Hans Christian Andersen Award; Hao Jingfang took the Hugo Award (following Liu Cixin, the first Chinese winner of the award in 2015); and Wang Anyi, grabbed the 2017 Newman Prize for Chinese Literature from the University of Oklahoma in September. Veteran literary critic Meng Fanhua says the power of Chinese stories comes from the rural areas, \"where we have the strongest literary traditions\".   - Books published in 2016 in English or Chinese (clockwise from top left): Death\\'s End by Liu Cixin, Mercy by Lu Nei, Ruined City by Jia Pingwa, Flock of Brown Birds by Ge Fei, The Cocoon by Zhang Yueran and Paper Hawk by Ge Liang. Photos Provided to China Daily  Another veteran critic - Bai Ye, from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences - says that while traditional and established novel writers continue to produce works, younger writers who were born in the 1970s, 80s and 90s are also gaining ground. \"Every year there are about 5,000 novels published in the country. But, this year, I noticed writers are more keen to reflect the pulse of society, and their writings are close to everyday reality and easier for general readers to accept.\" Bai, who produces an annual report on Chinese novels, adds that rural life is one of the key elements in the books published last year. As urbanization expands, the nostalgia for rural life grows, as seen in Jia Pingwa\\'s work The Jihua Flower, he says. The novel, about the plight of an abducted girl, stirred a debate about gender equality soon after its release in March. Other themes writers tackled last year were urban life and history. \"It was also a trend for writers to personalize their take on history, offering a touch of warmth to a cold past,\" Bai says, pointing to Mao Dun Literature Award winner Ge Fei\\'s Wang Chun Feng (or The Spring Breeze) as an example of this kind of work. Wang Chun Feng is about a village\\'s transformation as seen through the eyes of a young boy.    Giving other examples of these kinds of works, Bai points to Fang Fang\\'s Bare Burial, a story about a lost family history during and after the country\\'s land reform, and Lu Nei\\'s Mercy, about a factory worker\\'s life before and after China\\'s reform and opening-up. Another example is Hong Kong-based writer Ge Liang, who was born in 1978, and his semibiographical referring to younger writers, Bai says that those born in the 1980s are making a noticeable impression on their audiences. Zhang Yueran made a mark with The Cocoon, which is about two young people searching for the facts behind the disappearance of their fathers. Online writer Tangjia Sanshao (real name Zhang Wei) also caught Bai\\'s attention with an autobiographical novel about how a self-made writer achieved fame with help of his wife. Online literature is offering more choices to readers. It \"fills a blank in the Chinese book market\", says Shao Yanjun, a web literature expert at Peking University who says he expects internet literature to be assimilated more into the mainstream.    Eight internet writers were elected to the national committee of the China Writers\\' Association at the group\\'s annual meeting in December. Tangjia Sanshao was elected to the presidium of the association. Explaining how internet literature is growing from strength to strength, Shao says it has now become a major source of adaptation for movies and games, and because of its large readership there is a spurt in the sales of TV and film rights of online works in China. For instance, The Interpreters, a TV series based on a work by Miao Juan about the professional and love lives of two language translators, attracted millions of viewers when it hit TV screens in May. As for the money online writers are making, Liu Chang, who started writing science fiction novels full-time in 2012 under the pen name Biting Dog, says that the TV and film adaptation rights for his work Global Evolution is worth around 2 million yuan ($300,000; 270,000 euros; 246,500). \"Internet literature is becoming more diverse in terms of quality and topics,\" says Peking University\\'s Shao, citing Zeng Dengke (pen name Crazy Banana) as a good example. Zeng writes historical fantasy and tries to match classical literature. Another significant trend noticed by Shao and her students is that Chinese internet literature is attracting Western readers, who are also translating Chinese online novels into English on online forums such as Wuxiaworld.com. The site was started by Chinese-American Lai Jingping, known as RWX on the forum, who quit a foreign service job to start the translation website. As for literary genres that made it big last year, sci-fi was near the top. Wu Yan, director of the Sci-fi Study Center at Beijing Normal University, says he sees more attention being paid to the genre, with a growing number of forums and campus seminars. Even though Hugo Award winner Liu Cixin joked that Chinese scientists were keeping their distance from sci-fi writers, Wu says the China Association for Science and Technology took many initiatives to use sci-fi to promote popular science to the public. Its efforts included organizing the China Sci-Fi Festival, the first large-scale sci-fi event, in Beijing in September. Moreover, sci-fi works have begun to infiltrate classrooms, which once dismissed such works. \"Even startups are focusing on sci-fi,\" he says. \"But, despite the good news for sci-fi in China, I did not see too many good works produced in 2016.\" However, despite his disappointment, Wu recommended a few works. Among his picks were young sci-fi writer Jiang Bo, who recently finished the last installment of his trilogy The Heart of Galaxy, which won the World Chinese Science Fiction Association prize. Wu also recommended River of Time, a work on time travel by 68-year-old Wang Jinkang, who has been writing science fiction for more than 20 years. Other notable mentions included the works of overseas Chinese-Americans published in China, such as short stories by sci-fi writer Ken Liu, whose translations of the works of Liu Cixin and Hao Jingfang helped them win their Hugos. Another Chinese-American who earned a mention was Karen Bao, a graduate of Columbia University, who recently published the first installment of her sci-fi series The Dove Chronicles in China. On a more somber note, 2016 was also the year when China lost two literary stars: Chen Zhongshi and Yang Jiang.

       " ['A dumpling for every season nan Here\\'s why jiaozi are consumed with gusto during so many Chinese holidays and festivals How do Chinese people celebrate festivals? Even if you are not a China expert, you might have been able to guess this one: eating é¥ºå\\xad\\x90 (jiÇ\\x8eozi) thin pieces of dough with ground meat or vegetable filling, steamed or boiled (also known as dumplings). In a country with a history of thousands of years and a diverse culinary culture, it\\'s hard to imagine that such a commonplace item can be regarded as one of the country\\'s most representative dishes. It can be said without exaggeration that, at least in northern China (not all over the country - more on that later), jiaozi plays an important role in almost half of Chinese festivals. One should eat jiaozi at Chinese New Year, the fifth day of the first month according to the lunar calendar, the Autumn Commencement, the Winter Commencement and the Winter Solstice. As the Chinese saying goes: \"Food is the god of the people.\"    Alternatively, we can conclude that when foodies really want to eat something, they can always find reasons. The Chinese New Year Eating jiaozi on Chinese New Year\\'s Eve is the most important custom in northern China during Spring Festival. Families get together around a table to wrap jiaozi together in the evenings and eat them at midnight. That\\'s because, according to ancient timekeeping customs, a day was divided into 12 two-hour periods and the period between 11 pm and 1 am was called å\\xad\\x90æ\\x97¶(zÇ\\x90sh¨ª), or the Zi period. On New Year\\'s Eve, the Zi period marked the transition from an old year to a new year and had a special name, äº¤å\\xad\\x90 (jiÄ\\x81ozÇ\\x90), which sounded very similar to jiaozi. What\\'s more, the shape of a jiaozi is just like a gold yu¨¢nbÇ\\x8eo (å\\x85\\x83å®\\x9d, ingot), an ancient currency, so people eat jiaozi at the dinner with the wish that they will have prosperity in the new year. Some cooks will hide a coin inside a jiaozi and whoever happens to find it is said to have good luck in the coming year.    The fifth day of the first month in the lunar calendar Just five days after New Year\\'s Eve, people eat jiaozi again. This custom is called \"breaking the fifth\", or ç\\xa0´äº\\x94 (pÃ²wÇ\\x94), because there are so many taboos during the Spring Festival period such as doing needlework, breaking things, getting your hair cut and so on. However, after the fifth day after the New Year, those taboos don\\'t exist anymore, so people celebrate by eating jiaozi. A special custom exists in the city of Tianjin and surrounding areas, where people believe that when you wrap jiaozi, you need to press the wrapper edges tightly so that people who like to talk about you behind your back will have their mouths zipped in the coming year. The start of the Fu days The Fu days can be understood as the \"dog days\" of the Chinese summer, which usually last 30 or 40 days between the traditional calendar seasons of \"Little Heat\" and \"Great Heat\". The first day of Fu is another jiaozi day. Because the Fu days are the hottest time of the year, people usually lack appetite, so something delicious is needed to stimulate their taste buds. Jiaozi, a popular food that many people liked since ancient times, became the optimal choice. And because the Fu days took place during the start of harvest, every household could afford the good meal. The start of autumn When the high temperature that takes away people\\'s appetites finally drops, cool autumn arrives, and it\\'s definitely worth celebrating. On the Autumn Commencement day of the lunar calendar, it is believed people should eat something good, especially meat, to è´´ç§\\x8bè\\x86?(tiÄ\\x93 qiÅ«biÄ\\x81o) gain autumn weight, because most people have lost some weight during the long hot summer and need to gain it back to stay healthy during the winter. Of course, for jiaozi lovers, dumplings with meat filling works perfectly. The start of winter When the weather is hot, you eat jiaozi; when it\\'s cold, jiaozi-lovers will eat jiaozi, too. Eating jiaozi on the Winter Commencement day is one of the best-known jiaozi customs in China, and it is related to the origin of jiaozi. Though there are many folk stories explaining how jiaozi was invented, the most popular one was about the famous doctor Zhang Zhongjing. Zhang was a great practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine, who lived during the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220). One day in winter, when Zhang was on his way home, he found many poor people had frostbitten ears, because they didn\\'t have warm clothes and sufficient food. Zhang tried to heal their ears. He stewed lamb, peppers and some medicine in a pot, chopped them into small pieces and used them to fill small dough wrappers. Zhang named these dumplings å¨\\x87è\\x80?jiÄ\\x81o\\'Ä\\x9br), literally meaning \"tender ear\", and boiled them every day to feed his patients. Gradually, these patients became better and, when Spring Festival came, their ears were healed. In order to express their gratitude to Zhang, people began to imitate his recipe to make jiao\\'er, which later became the current jiaozi, and ate them to celebrate Spring Festival. The winter solstice Chinese people have long placed a great deal of importance on the winter solstice. Family members get together, worship their ancestors and eat jiaozi. Some claim the reason people eat jiaozi on this day is also to commemorate Zhang Zhongjing, while others said it\\'s because of a goddess in ancient Chinese legend, N¨¹wa, who is known for creating humans and repairing a great hole that one day appeared the sky. It is said that N¨¹wa existed at the beginning of the world and created humans by sculpting them with yellow clay. But when she made ears for these humans, she worried that the clay would freeze and the ears wouldn\\'t stay attached to their heads when it became cold. Therefore, she pierced their ears and used a string to fix them to their heads. So, on the winter solstice, which is the darkest and one of the coldest times of year, people make and eat the ear-shaped jiaozi in memory of N¨¹wa, and it\\'s said if you don\\'t eat jiaozi this day, your ears will freeze and drop from your head. Jiaozi lovers can always find a reason to eat jiaozi, but the interesting thing is that it just happens in the north, where there is a tradition of eating wheat-based food. Southern people, whose traditional dishes tend to be based more on rice, are not crazy about it, even though as more people migrate around the country for work and consume mass media (such as CCTV\\'s documentary about jiaozi as the ultimate Chinese festival food), the northern customs are becoming better known and even adopted by some southerners. However, traditionally, southerners had other choices for festivals. At Spring Festival, they eat tangyuan or fried nian\\'gao, traditional dishes made from sticky rice; on the winter solstice, they eat tangyuan; for Lantern Festival they of course also eat tangyuan. There are also dishes special to certain regions; other winter solstice foods, for instance, include fried sticky rice consumed in the Jiangnan region, nine-layer rice cakes and soy flour-covered sweet round cakes made of glutinous rice paste in parts of the southeastern coast (and Taiwan), noodles and pumpkin patties in Anhui province and mutton soup in Shandong. After all, China is a vast land so to designate one dish as the official festival food would probably lead to a civil war - but at least we can agree that the holidays are the perfect excuse to binge on all your favorite dishes.

       " [\"The land of cold and gold nan China's northernmost territory is a true winter wonderland for tourists It takes courage to explore Mohe in winter - and some warm clothes. Very warm clothes. A lot of them. Temperatures in China's northernmost county plummet to a biting -40 C at night.   - Clockwise from top left: Tourists aboard one-horse sleighs in Santa Village in China's northernmost county of Mohe, Heilongjiang province; a visitor plays a popular game of splashing hot water, which freezes instantly in the cold air; villagers hack a hole in the river and push a net down for fish; a reindeer-drawn sleigh in front of the Santa's house. Liu Xiangrui / China Daily  Days aren't much warmer. But its icy climate is exactly what gives the small border settlement in Heilongjiang province its appeal. At least much of it. China is said to be shaped like a rooster. Mohe perches on the crest that prods Russia's belly. Such offerings as the northern lights have elevated its position on the tourism map. I recently visited the county and spent a few relaxing - and freezing - days in Beiji village, the country's northernmost community. It was worth enduring the cold to experience Mohe's magic. I'd prepared fretfully. I borrowed thick shoes and other winterwear from friends. But I realized I had to buy even warmer footwear upon arrival. Still, my feet froze. Nonetheless, I was excited, as were the other tourists in our group from the southern province of Guangdong. We spent the first night in the county town, where illuminated ice and snow sculptures lined the streets. We headed to Beiji the next day. About two decades ago, it was a poor hamlet. Today, it's a national 5A tourist attraction, the highest level. We climbed a lookout tower halfway to the village and saw a river snaking through woodlands of rime-sheathed trees. Then we enjoyed a stroll along a boardwalk through birch forests. The village is situated on the southern bank of the Heilongjiang River, which marks the border with Russia. Travelers come to visit China's northernmost post office, bank and primary school. But its biggest single attraction is the aurora borealis. It's said to be the only place in China where the electromagnetic phenomenon can be seen. Hundreds of photographers flock to the destination every summer in hope of capturing the northern lights - although sightings are rare in the warmer months. I enjoyed it most when the village went silent after 10 pm. We used phone apps to detect constellations among the countless stars. We were able to snap a couple of satisfying photos of the Milky Way after standing outdoors for nearly two hours. Despite the late night, we got up around 6 am to enjoy seeing the sunrise from a an observation tower. Morning light sparkled on the rime-encrusted woodland. Haze drifted through the valley. Chimney smoke coiled from dwellings on the river's Russian side. Such scenery is best explored aboard a one-horse open sleigh (jingle bells not included). The village has a team of drivers, and passengers ride under quilts in the vehicles. We watched them whoosh by on our way to go ice fishing. Villagers hack holes in the river and use a long pole to push a net down. A day or two later, they return to collect their catch. The fish are said to be particularly tasty but hauls depend on luck. Afterward, we headed to the nearby Santa Village. It happened to be a few days before Christmas and it was looking a lot like it everywhere we went. Here, St. Nick's job isn't making a list, checking it twice and finding out who's naughty or nice. It's posing for photos with tourists. Spoiler alert: As Mohe isn't really the North Pole, Santa isn't really Kriss Kringle but rather a Finnish native who plays the part. Mostly, his job is posing for photos with guests. Speaking of poles, we did see a pole-dancing party in front of Santa's house. An unlikely venue, perhaps. But seasonal performances are staged in which dancers dazzle crowds for up to five minutes outdoors with nothing but bikinis to shield them from the cold. Hearty fare helps stave off the cold in Mohe. I particularly enjoyed goose stewed with potatoes in a traditional wood-fired oven. As we dined, more ingredients were added - pickled Chinese cabbage and frozen tofu - a local specialty. On our way back to the county town, we stopped by Old Gold Valley to learn about the region's history. The yellow mineral was discovered in a 14-kilometer-long gorge over a century ago. A rush began and prospectors flooded the riverbanks in the following decades. Gold can still be found in the sand, our guide says. Today, perhaps the snowy climate's tourism appeal makes white the new gold in Mohe. liuxiangrui@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page19)\"],\n",
       " ['A dish full of history nan Editor\\'s note: To understand China, sit down to eat. Food is the indestructible bond that holds the whole social fabric together and it is also one of the last strong bonds of community and culture. It is a dish full of history, and there are about as many myths and legends attached to it as there are ingredients in the recipe. Unlike many Chinese classics for the dinner table, this one has no fancy title. It is simply known as pencai, or \"dish in a basin\". The name reflects the presentation. Layers of food are stacked on top of one another in a large serving pot or basin. To find out why, we need to hark back to its origins.     - The layerings of meat and vegetables provide a delicate harmony of taste and texture. Photos by Chuai Meitu / For China Daily   Many versions of how this dish came about are floating around the wild blue yonder of the internet, but the elements are largely the same as the story my mother told me when I first tasted pencai in Hong Kong decades ago. The story involved a fugitive king or general washed up on the shores of either Shenzhen or Hong Kong - cold, hungry and in need of the kindness of strangers. The strangers were variously fishermen or village folk, depending on which version of the story one prefers. Out of sympathy and respect, the common folk brought out the best ingredients they had in their homes and cooked for their down-and-out visitor. They were so poor they didn\\'t have enough spare crockery for guests, so the food was served from a wooden basin. One thing everyone agreed on was the Hakka element. The Hakka are the \"guest people\" - emigrants from the Central Plains who settled in the coastal provinces of the south, notably Fujian and Guangdong. In Hong Kong they built villages surrounded by low enclosures called weicun, or walled villages. In neighboring Shenzhen, they formed fishing communities and also settled in the hills of nearby Meizhou. There is historical evidence that the royal refugee would most likely have been hosted by a Hakka community. The Hakka are famous to this day for their pencai, which is eaten on festive occasions such as birthdays, weddings and on the eve of the lunar new year, during the reunion dinner.    It is a masterpiece of cooking skill and frugality, with expert layering of ingredients that sound contradictory but actually provide a delicate harmony of taste and texture. At the very bottom of the large basin is a layer of braised radish, a root vegetable that withstands long cooking and readily absorbs the juices of meat and seafood. On top of the radish is usually braised pork belly, its rich fat leaching down to nourish the radishes. The pork may be topped with fried tofu or gluten balls, which again soak up the fatty meat juices and act as a soft barrier for the next layer. Roast duck or steamed chicken on top of the tofu or gluten adds distinctive flavor and texture - especially duck, whose fat lends a special fragrance to the dish. The next layer, again vegetables, is likely to be thick slices of yam or taro, chosen for the ability to complement meat. The layering will go on, alternating meat, seafood and vegetables until the chef runs out of imagination and ingredients. Generally, the best ingredients are displayed on the very top, and some pencai may even see the luxurious addition of dried scallops, whole abalones or sea cucumber. Other ingredients used may include dried oysters, prawns, fish maw, crab, fish cakes or meatballs. In fact, the pencai may be assembled from very economical items, not just expensive, exclusive treats. Pencai is popular in Huaiyang cuisine as well, a cooking style that is quickly gaining popularity in China for its lighter, natural flavors. It has traveled far from its Yangzhou-Huai\\'an roots and is now often served at state banquets, including dinners served at the Great Hall of the People. A senior colleague from Yangzhou says the Huaiyang version of pencai also has the characteristic layerings of meat and vegetables. What makes it different is that it will have two very Huaiyang ingredients - danjiao and fish meatballs. Danjiao are dumplings made with an egg skin. Beaten egg is poured into a heated ladle and swirled until slightly set. A spoonful of filling is added and the dumpling is quickly folded over. The dumplings are laid out in rows in the pencai to fully cook. Fish meatballs are equally laborious to make. The filleted meat of the freshest fish is scraped and minced and beaten together until it forms a light, white cloud. With a dexterous squeeze and twist, a meatball is formed and dropped into boiling water. The finished meatballs are then added to the pencai. Huaiyang cuisine only uses sea cucumber to top the dish, and skips the abalone. The dish has also been duplicated in the north, where it\\'s known as quanjiafu, or \"family reunion\". However, the ingredients may be more rough-and-ready, and it may lose some of its southern finesse. The romance of the dish seems to fade as it travels. paulined@chinadaily.com.cn A popular dish for Spring Festival reunions A new culinary phenomenon that has surfaced in recent years is the hotel hamper for Spring Festival. In many ways, it is like the traditional Christmas hamper, minus the turkey or ham. It also reflects the changing lifestyle of many urban Chinese. A series of family meals is a traditional part of the festivities, starting with the reunion dinner on New Year\\'s Eve. The first day of the Chinese New Year sees another gathering of family and friends, and the feasting may go on for a week. While in the past a battalion of mothers, aunts and sisters would be churning out dishes from the kitchen, it is getting increasingly likely that food may be ordered in. This is where the hotel hampers come in, with their gifts of cakes, buns and a large ready-to-heat pot of pencai, an ideal dish for such occasions, All you need to do is to reheat the pot on a low fire and wait until the ingredients are again warm and bubbling. Cooking time is minimal because the dish has been prepared in advance. And its ready mix of seafood, meat and vegetables is a luxurious and impressive treat for all.

       " ['Company has grand designs on the world nan A 30-volume series of children\\'s books received a lot attention online in China recently, not just because of its sheer size but also because of the source of its financial backing - crowdfunding organized by an online bookshop. The illustrations in the 30 volumes of stories, taken from all over the world, reflect the breadth of the books and the stories in them - 3,000 pictures by 30 illustrators from various countries and regions, such as Francesca Greco and Valentina Fiore Perla from Italy. \"There are stories from Grimm\\'s Fairy Tales and from the Middle East, and of course illustrators from those countries and regions are very well suited to that job,\" says Hou Mingliang, founder of IlluSalon, a company in Beijing that aims to bring together illustrators and those who use illustrations. \"Prices of illustrations can vary widely, depending largely on the local economy. There may be little difference in the quality of works when you compare various places, but some will be expensive while others are extremely cheap. \"With IlluSalon, publishers have many choices and can make decisions based on their needs and their budgets.\" In China, publishers have long paid students in fine arts academies a pittance to churn out illustrations for books. \"There is a joke about those cheap illustrations,\" says Gao Shan, chief executive of IlluSalon. \"If you go to many illustrations and remove the hair or skin color of the figures in them you will find that all the eyes and noses - including those of dogs, cats and humans - are similar.\" One reason such conditions have prevailed for so long is that there is a scarcity of good channels through which anyone can find suitable illustrators, Hou says. \"Also, publishers demand the best illustrations, but are not willing to pay accordingly,\" Hou says. IlluSalon was founded in 2014 at a time when an upswing in demand in China for good-quality illustrations and picture books was emerging. \"We have lived through the printing era and the writing era and are now in the audiovisual era,\" Hou says. \"So people are crying out for more pictures, especially really creative ones that express a creator\\'s ideas.\" IlluSalon has been the driving force behind a new event that recognizes artistic talent, the Global Illustration Award. At the Frankfurt Book Fair in October, IlluSalon hosted the awards ceremony. More than 10,000 entries from five continents were received in two months, in five illustration categories: covers, children\\'s books, editorial, scientific, and one entitled \"Learning to live together\". The awards went to 15 artists from seven countries and regions. One of the original aims of IlluSalon was to bring foreign illustrators into the Chinese market as it continues to grow. Further down the road, the idea is to introduce Chinese illustrators to the world. IlluSalon says it has signed contracts with about 1,000 foreign illustrators, mainly from Europe. \"Illustrators who want to join us can show us their works,\" Hou says. \"After signing a contract with us we will link illustrators with customers, and eventually we should have a stable of great illustrators. They will be the backbone of IlluSalon.\" Under IlluSalon\\'s plans the website would eventually become a trading platform akin to taobao.com. Illustrators would post introductions of themselves and their works on the website, and potential customers would use key words to search for works or creators. IlluSalon says that in addition to publishers, it has customers from other fields such as Apple and the global advertising agency Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn. IlluSalon says it has found illustrators from all over the world to paint emoji packages that users can pay to download from Apple. \"We want to build a platform through which the creative abilities of illustrators and their works can circulate efficiently globally,\" Hou says.

       " ['The big picture nan Illustrators struggle to draw attention to the value of their work Two-and-a-half millennia after Confucius said that \"one seeing is worth a hundred hearings\", some bright spark in the English-speaking world took a leaf out of the great sage\\'s book and came up with \"a picture is worth a thousand words\". The West gave birth last century to an industry that employs millions of people who provide illustrations for books, cataloges, advertising and other media. And, yet somewhere along the way, in China the old message seems to have been overlooked. Only in recent years has the printed picture begun to make an impact as a medium par excellence for getting messages across in many different areas.   - Children\\'s picture books have been growing in popularity in the past few years. Xu han (inset), one of the artists who caters to this genre, created the iconic character Ali. Photos Provided to China Daily     - One of the drawings by Zhang Yunbao, an editor and illustrator of children\\'s picture books.    One of those who is aware of how far China has lagged behind - but is now seeing it making strides to catch up - is Zhang Yunbao, 29, a children\\'s picture book editor for Beijing Poplar Culture Project Co. In her free time she draws commercial illustrations and makes her own picture books. Zhang has worked in the field for five years and says she has noticed that in the past two years demand for both commercial illustrations and children\\'s picture books has begun to take off, \"which holds the prospect of a much bigger market in coming years\". \"You can see that illustrations are increasingly wanted by online shops, clothing brands, cellphone brands and booths in shopping malls.\" Over each of the past 10 years, sales of children\\'s picture books have grown by an average of 10 to 12 percent in China, says Hou Mingliang, founder of IlluSalon, an organization founded in Beijing in 2014 to promote the use of illustrations in China and bring together illustrators and customers. Hou has worked in children\\'s book publishing for eight years.    As China fulfils its mission of ensuring that most of its citizens are clothed, fed and feeling well-off materially, the public is developing an appetite for intellectual and spiritual nourishment that only education and the arts, such as music, literature and painting can give, he says. Li Ajiu, 32, a freelance illustrator in Shanghai, says that just 10 years ago when she graduated from university, illustrated books were hard to come by in China, but now they are everywhere. That is partly because parents have come to accept the concept of picture books, she says. Hou says: \"Picture books with beautiful illustrations, good stories and creative storytelling will exert great influence on children, who construct the world and connect themselves with society through them. So good picture books are very important.\" However, 85 percent of children\\'s picture books are imported and only 15 percent are domestic creations, Hou says. Chinese parents prefer to buy imported picture books for their children because the values reflected in the stories are expressed in more creative ways and the quality is generally better than that of domestic works, he says. \"And for publishing houses, good-quality imported picture books - particularly ones that have won awards - are safer in the market.\" Some people attribute this to the longer history of the illustration tradition in Europe and the United States, which cultivate highly talented illustrators. Hou and Zhang, say many other factors are hampering the growth of the domestic illustration industry. Zhang can recall few cases in which those who have ordered illustrations from her have offered a contract for her to sign. In most cases the only communication is by email and, without legal protection, some illustrators have to fight to get paid even after their work has been used. Apart from requiring artistic talent and training, creating an illustration is time-consuming, and most illustrators who have not made a name for themselves struggle to survive on meager earnings. In fact, many of Zhang\\'s illustrator friends say trying to make a living from their art is out of the question. \"They all love painting, but they have to live,\" she says. Han Dan, 28, an illustrator who is known on the internet as Ghost Master, is an editor at Chemical Industry Press in Beijing. The lethargic growth in the publication of original picture books in China is partly the result of a dearth of picture book editors in publishing houses and elsewhere she says. Zhang says: \"Apart from illustrators, most people do not know about illustrations, what kind of illustrators they need or what kind of creative styles they want. People in other fields know little about art and painting.\" For Han, another problem is the limited scope that illustrators have for selling their work. \"In China, picture books are mainly for children, and that means illustrators have a very limited space in which to express themselves.\" Hou says that in Europe, illustrations were originally created by people to express their ideas or imagination on canvas. Some of the more personal illustrations that carried the wisdom of older generations may have been shown to the young as a means of education. He cites The Tale of Peter Rabbit by Beatrix Potter, saying that Potter originally just painted for herself without thinking about publishing. But after she showed the stories to a friend, he encouraged her to publish them. Peter Rabbit then became a popular picture book, which has become a classic. \"Many European illustrators draw very personal stories and then have them published,\" Hou says. Han has rarely drawn commercial illustrations because \"they usually don\\'t like my style, which is cool, not that kind of warm or light style\". She has been working intermittently on stories about ghosts living in another world. \"I have talked to people on an online illustration platform. Obviously what they are looking for are illustrations for children books, so for them weird or cold, dark themes and colors are out. \"I know some Chinese illustrators who are really good. You may say they lack creativity compared with people in Europe or the United States but that\\'s because they cannot express themselves fully.\" To gauge the quality of illustrations in a certain country you have to see the general level of the illustrators, not just a few of the top ones, Hou says. \"Maybe this is going to offend some people, but the average level of Chinese illustrators is low. Many are just craftspeople who are good at technique but lack the quality to become masters because they don\\'t have a big enough reserve of culture, including literature, music and painting. \"China\\'s arts education is twisted. Students who go to fine art academies are usually those who may not be able to enter general universities. Ideas are most important for illustrations and the images are secondary. \"So there is still a long way to go. Nowadays, Chinese people, on average, read no more than five books annually, compared with more than 60 in Israel.\" College teacher Xu Han creates stories about Ali, the popular red fox. Now he is directing a movie about the character. He says that when he creates the picture books, the biggest challenge he faces is writing good stories rather than getting the painting technique right. \"The core of a picture book is the story. To write a good story you have to build up a big collection of ideas from everyday life,\" he says. The task that illustrators or designers face covers more than just artistic technique and form. It also entails trying to express oneself through the content, Xu says. Zhang says that when she was deciding which university to attend her father, who always encouraged her to chase her dreams, suggested that she should go to a comprehensive university rather than a special one. \"When I was little, my father told me to find the thing I really love and pursue it as a career. Of course, academies of fine arts have their advantages, with better faculties and richer artistic perspectives for students. \"My father said, \\'I know you love painting, but at an academy of fine arts you will be surrounded by nothing but arts. If you go to a comprehensive university there are various kinds of things you can learn about, which I think is better for your development\\'. \"I personally believe that illustrators need to care about more than painting - things such as literature, movies, theater, photography or child psychology. You also need to know about society. These things are connected.\" Luo Qianxi, 26, a freelance illustrator in Beijing, says China\\'s illustration industry lacks organizations or agencies that can help creators promote their works. \"Illustrators spend most of their time and energy on creation. They don\\'t know how to find customers or promote themselves. On the other hand, there are many well-developed organizations and agencies in Europe that help illustrators promote themselves and find customers. They also have good platforms to sell their works,\" Luo says. In addition, in Europe people generally are more familiar with the illustration industry and often support and respect illustrators\\' works, she says. In China, piracy is also a big problem, says Xia Mengyu, another freelance illustrator. However, Hou believes that in the future illustrations will become mainstream in China and even part of everyday life. They will appear everywhere, and people will use them to decorate their houses or to promote their products, he says. Good works will be collected and stored. \"This is an audiovisual era, and the day will come soon.\" yangyang@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page16)'],\n",

Tu is best known for discovering artemisinin, a substance derived from the traditional Chinese medicine qinghaosu, which is used to treat malaria. She is the first woman to receive the national award. Zhao Zhongxian, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has spent four decades researching superconductors. Twenty-seven scientists have received the nation\\'s top science and technology award since it was established in 2000. It comes with a prize of 5 million yuan ($721,000; 680,900 euros; 595,900). The award is one way the government encourages fundamental research, Premier Li Keqiang said at the ceremony. Scientists should be dedicated to patient research since China is in greater need of scientific progress than at any other time, he said. Li paraphrased a Chinese proverb, saying that scientists \"could stay silent for a decade\" but \"try to amaze the world with a single brilliant feat\". He vowed to protect intellectual property rights, which he said are crucial for innovation. The nation will have sustainable development only by relying on innovation, he said. Li also expressed gratitude to the foreign scientists and scholars who have contributed to China\\'s scientific progress. The country welcomes foreign scholars for entrepreneurship and innovation, he said, adding that the government will provide opportunities and facilities for international talent willing to work in China. Five foreign experts, including Katharina Kohse-Hoeinghaus, a professor at the University of Bielefeld in Germany, and one organization received China\\'s International Science and Technology Cooperation Award during the ceremony. The Chang\\'e-3 project shared the Top Science and Technology Progress Award with 19 others.

       " ['Clean-up drive for disciplinary teams nan Clear standards set for handling tips, working cases and managing assets The country\\'s 500,000-plus corruption investigators are being placed under stricter supervision after a regulation to standardize graft probes was adopted on Jan 8.    Experts says the regulation, passed at the annual plenary meeting of the top anti-corruption watchdog - the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China - can help ensure an unsullied disciplinary team, after some corrupt investigators were exposed. The regulation, details of which were not released, sets clear standards on how to handle corruption tips, how to check and review cases and how to manage ill-gotten money and assets, according to a report published on the commission\\'s website on Jan 8. It also encourages audio and video recordings throughout the entire process of the interrogation and the establishment of a registration system for those who make inquiries about, or try to interfere in, the cases, the report said. \"Trust (in disciplinary officials) cannot replace supervision,\" a meeting communique released on Jan 8 said. \"We must make sure the power granted by the Party and the people is not abused.\" Many commission members who attended the three-day meeting say they have felt rising pressure on disciplinary officials. In recent years, President Xi Jinping has repeatedly required officials to \"clean house\" to ensure a trustworthy disciplinary team. \"As those who enforce anti-graft rules, we must first place ourselves under scrutiny,\" says Liu Qifan, head of the anti-corruption watchdog in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region. China launched a massive anti-corruption and austerity campaign as the top Party leadership was elected in late 2012. Xi said on Jan 6 that years of effort have stopped corruption from spreading, and a \"crushing momentum\" against graft has taken shape. However, some disciplinary officials have become conceited with the anti-corruption achievements, and a small number of them have loosened their self-restraint and become corrupt themselves, says Wang Yanfei, head of the provincial discipline watchdog in Sichuan province. Since late 2012, more than 7,900 disciplinary officials from across the country have been punished for various types of wrongdoing, with 17 from the top anti-corruption watchdog being placed under investigation in graft probes, according to figures from the commission. Recently, a three-episode TV documentary produced by the commission, named To Forge an Iron, One Must Be Strong Oneself, offered the public a rare glimpse into guilty officials from discipline inspection authorities. It featured the cases of 10 former anti-graft officials, including Zhu Mingguo, who was once in charge of fighting corruption in Guangdong province. In the documentary, Zhu, convicted in November of taking bribes of 141 million yuan ($20.4 million; 19 million euros, 16 million), admitted that he made use of his position. He said he received over a thousand bottles of expensive alcohol as gifts, and had taken bribes as far back as the 1990s. \"It is very rare for the commission to make such a documentary for publicity,\" says Xie Chuntao, director of the Dean\\'s Office of the CPC Central Committee Party School, adding that the move also reflects the commission\\'s determination to strengthen self-supervision.

       " ['Sports authority proposes cap on football salaries nan As China\\'s lavish football clubs continue to sign foreign stars for staggering sums of money, the country\\'s top sports body is considering imposing a salary cap to restrict excessive spending and achieve more sustainable development of the domestic league. A cost ceiling for players should be set to curb the mounting financial burden on clubs, the General Administration of Sport of China, the country\\'s top sports body, said in a statement released on Jan 5. It also said more transparent financial auditing of clubs should be conducted. \"A series of issues, such as clubs spending excessively on overpriced foreigners - while neglecting investment in youth training - have been hampering the long-term development of the game,\" the statement said. Chinese Super League clubs spent $363 million (345 million euros; 298 million) on star imports early last year, followed by the arrival of another costly foreign legion in December, including Brazilian midfielder Oscar and Argentine striker Carlos Tevez. On Dec 23, Oscar was signed by Shanghai SIPG, from English Premier League giant Chelsea, for $63.5 million, eclipsing the previous record of $58.9 million paid by SIPG for his compatriot Hulk in July. Shanghai Greenland Shenhua, another CSL club in the city, announced three days later the signing of Tevez, a former Manchester City striker, from Argentine club Boca Juniors for $11 million over two-years. With CSL\\'s winter transfer window open until Feb 28, more expensive signings are expected. Some established overseas professional sports leagues, such as the National Basketball Association, have long used salary caps to keep the investment of each team within a reasonable range. However, it would be difficult for Chinese football to cap itself at the moment, despite good intentions, observers say. \"The sentiment is a positive thing, as the spending is clearly way out of control. It\\'s a good thing that people in power look to try to control the spending,\" says Mark Dreyer, founder of the China Sports Insider website. \"The problem is that it\\'s extremely hard to institute a cap to an existing league, and to get it right with the amount,\" he says, because the salary cap constantly changes in overseas leagues based on league income. \"To bring it into existing leagues, with players already fixed on multi-year contract, is very tricky,\" Dreyer says. Tan Jianxiang, a sports sociology expert at South China Normal University, says clubs could still bypass the mandatory ceiling by compensating their star players in the name of training or traffic subsidies. \"The administration should focus more on making policies to inspire more investment in youth development, rather than dictating the financial operation of the league,\" he says. The administration also said in its Jan 5 statement that the CSL should allocate funding from its annual revenues to support the development of reserve teams and youth leagues. sunxiaochen@chinadaily.com.cn    (China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page14)'],\n",

He was charged by prosecutors with using his position at the court to provide conveniences for individuals or entities in the handling of cases and the public listing of companies, the Second Intermediate People\\'s Court said in an online statement. Traffic gets worse, but also better One-third of China\\'s 100 largest cities faced worsening traffic congestion in 2016, according to a survey by AutoNavi Software Co. Beijing lost its 2015 position as the country\\'s most congested city; it was replaced by Jinan, followed by Harbin, capital of Heilongjiang province. In many cases, more cars were to blame. In the 32 cities where traffic worsened, it took almost twice as long to reach a destination during rush hours - from 7 to 9 am and 5 to 7 pm - than it took at off-peak hours, the company said. Traffic in 36 cities was unchanged from the previous year, while 32 cities improved, the report said. Anti-graft agencies to be realigned China\\'s four-year anti-corruption fight will produce a new institution - a supervisory commission - to integrate separate and less effective corruption control authorities.

Regional equity rules enhanced China is enhancing regulations for the regional equities market to boost its role in diversifying financing channels for the country\\'s micro, small and medium-sized businesses and to encourage private investment. Updated regulations were approved on Jan 11 at a State Council executive meeting presided over by Premier Li Keqiang. The new regulations make clear the need for the regional equity market as a financing channel for local small businesses, and they provide more specific requirements for market operators and investors. The regional equity market offers financing flexibility for small businesses and technological innovation.

National tobacco law has positive effect It is estimated that about 10 percent of the population of China - the world\\'s biggest tobacco consuming country, with more than 300 million smokers - now enjoy legal protection against secondhand smoke as a result of tobacco control regulations, according to a recent report. The report - A Civil Society Perspective on Tobacco Control in China 2016 - was published on Jan 10 by the ThinkTank Research Center for Health Development, one of the country\\'s most outspoken NGOs committed to tobacco control. To date, only three Chinese cities - Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen - have introduced smoking bans in public places, while some smaller cities have local laws on tobacco control. More ethanol from corn encouraged China will further encourage the use of corn to make ethanol this year as part of an effort to reduce its huge grain stocks.

It was a knowing, if flippant, expression of a contrary view that the Soviet Union was not the West\\'s biggest challenger. Ultimately China would re-emerge as the dominant world power. That seemed a ludicrously distant proposition at a time when China was emerging from the trials of the \"cultural revolution\" (1966-76) and US president Richard Nixon had only just initiated his pivot to Beijing. Then came the start of a four-decade era in China of \"reform and opening -up\", and the rest, as they say, is history.    Soviet power crumbled, the US emerged as the lone superpower and China continued on an economic long march that is seeing it challenge the Americans in the present decade for the title of world\\'s largest economy. So were all those optimistic Anglophones who learned Russian wasting their time? Are all those pessimists who learned Chinese poised to reap the benefits? The evidence is that most of the Anglosphere learned neither and remained stubbornly monolingual, while the rest of the world was busy learning English. English is now the undisputed language of international exchange. French, which once dominated diplomacy, has played a diminishing role. Around the world English is the lingua franca of millions of non-native speakers. Business deals and treaties are negotiated via the medium of what has become the No 1 world language. That may represent some kind of triumph for the Anglosphere, but it is scarcely a personal victory for individual Americans, Britons or other Anglophones. They are less and less likely to speak another language. An official 2013 British Council report revealed an \"alarming shortage\" of people able to speak the 10 languages vital to the country\\'s future prosperity and global standing. Mandarin figured prominently at No 4 on the British Council list.    Despite that warning, subsequent evidence shows that language learning has declined further in British schools. A 2015 report said British teachers found attracting pupils to study languages after the age of 16 was a \"challenge\". One small consolation was a \"modest increase\" - from a low base - in the number of schools offering Mandarin, a language \"recognized as crucial to the UK\\'s long-term competitiveness\". In the US, the situation is even worse. A 2015 survey showed that budget cuts, low enrollments and teacher shortages meant Americans were falling behind the rest of the world. It was revealed that less than 1 percent of American adults were proficient in a foreign language that they studied at school, in an era when one in five American jobs are tied to international trade. Sadly, a largely monolingual Anglosphere can probably continue to thrive in a globalized world despite the dire warnings of the educationalists. Now that everyone else seems to speak English, it may be tempting to ask, \"what\\'s the problem\". The problem is perhaps that learning a language also means learning a culture and learning a different way of thinking. It can also open up many possibilities that have nothing to do with business deals or international politics - access to culture, literature, personal friendships across borders. It is not too farfetched to theorize that the insularity so recently displayed by voters in Britain and the US might have at least some connection to the language issue. It has never been easier than now to learn a language through a range of online resources, many of them free. They even say it is good for your brain. Studies say bilingualism can delay the onset of dementia. So, as you start out on your New Year\\'s resolutions, forget the gym membership (you know you won\\'t last more than a month) and learn a language instead. Haoyun! Good luck!

       " [\"Pandas are cute, but spare a thought for red cousin nan If giant pandas had a cuteness rating, they'd be off the chart. What's not to like about a cuddly black-and-white bundle of fur that acts up for the camera every time it snows? China has made Herculean efforts to protect what is, to all intents and purposes, a national symbol. And there's good news, too, for all us pandaphiles. The 2014 Chinese census showed there were 1,835 pandas living in the wild in their natural bamboo forest habitat in southwest China - up from the 2004 census, which listed 1,600 wild pandas. And thanks to a 30-year conservation effort by the Chinese authorities, there are now about 300 giant pandas in captivity, most in Chinese conservation areas and zoos but about 50 in zoos worldwide, on loan from China and under strict supervision. With, of course, a steady supply of bamboo.    But what about their distant cousin, the red panda? Actually, scientists now say they are not part of the same genus, although they share the same habitat and love the same food - succulent bamboo stalks. In my book, red pandas are also well up there on the cuteness scale, so let's take a closer look. Smaller than his so-called cousin, the red panda (xiaoxiongmao in Chinese) looks more like a cross between a small cat and a bear, often with red fur and vivid white markings around the eyes and muzzle, as well as a distinctive bushy ringed tail. They are also found in Southwest China, and - like the giant panda - are an endangered species, although the giant panda has recently been upgraded to the lesser level of vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the international body for species protection. But the red panda is also found in parts of Tibet and Nepal. It's a solitary creature that also likes bamboo. Estimates of the wild population are difficult, but experts reckon there are about 10,000 of the little critters out there. The latest statistics show about 800 living happily in captivity. China's conservation efforts also extend to the red panda, with over 40 percent of its natural habitat in the country's southwest classified as protected area. Hunting and trapping are strictly forbidden. So why am I using my column as a pulpit to preach about pandas, red and giant? I think it's because, like many people, I've become acutely aware recently that for some species, time is running out. No one who has seen a tiger at a zoo can fail to be awed by the sheer power of what is, after all, a very sophisticated killing machine. Yet tigers are under threat.    The Zoological Society of London, with which China Daily has worked closely in the past, is focusing on preserving various species of tigers worldwide. These magnificent beasts are constantly under threat - there are those who still believe its skin, claws, teeth and bones are essential ingredients of traditional Asian medicine. You'd better sit down for this factoid. In past decades 95 percent - yes, 95 percent - of the world's tiger population has disappeared. In Indonesia, ZSL is supporting local wildlife rangers to protect the remaining 300 or so Sumatran tigers. There is hope - in 2010, worldwide tiger numbers hit an all-time low of 3,200 animals in the wild. Now, for the first time in more than a century, a global census showed that the number had risen to 3,890 animals. So whether it's a panda, giant or red, or a tiger, or an elephant - in fact anything that makes this planet worth living on - just say yes to conservation. We won't regret it.

       " ['2017 bodes well for Chinese takeovers nan New approach sees buyers opting for long-term brand enhancement rather than an overeager grab for profits Now that we have entered 2017 it may be easier to review dispassionately the business year behind, and to look ahead. In doing so, a more pragmatic view goes beyond the much-hyped macro indicators of gross domestic product and the consumer price index. Most significant throughout 2016 was the number and size of foreign takeovers by Chinese companies. The total value of Chinese mergers and acquisitions of foreign companies reached a record $247.2 billion (234.3 billion euros; 201.5 billion) in 2016. If this figure is not staggering enough, then how about the year-on-year percentage increase, which stands at an amazing 142 percent. Before discussing key deals that took place last year and then looking ahead at what to expect throughout 2017, the changing nature of these takeovers needs highlighting.   Takeovers involving raw material purchases and other supplies that are needed to fuel factory production now represent a far smaller percentage of Chinese acquisition activity. The focus now is much more on consumer branding and the technological know-how needed to fuel domestic consumption. It is now estimated that this new approach, set to continue as China\\'s economy continues its transition from low-cost production and exporting to domestic consumption of premium brands, accounts for approximately 50 percent of all Chinese company takeovers of foreign brands. Last year also highlighted major change in a variety of industries now targeted by Chinese companies in their foreign firm acquisition strategies. Even more significantly, last year witnessed the further emergence of privately owned Chinese companies planting a firm footprint on the international M&A scene. Going back only as far as 2013, Chinese takeover deals were heavily dominated by the state-owned sector, which typically went on the hunt for copper mines in Africa, iron ore producers in Australia and major players in the Canadian energy sector.  Europe is now very much the focus of increasingly ambitious and entrepreneurial privately- owned Chinese enterprises, with recent acquisitions of French fashion houses, Italian football teams and UK luxury brands. From finance to food and fashion to football, the increasing variety of industries targeted has been more than matched by the increasing amounts invested in huge takeovers of foreign companies and their branded products by Chinese companies. Last year saw the largest takeover to date by a Chinese company of a foreign firm. In August, Chinese chemical giant ChemChina secured the acquisition of Swiss pesticide and seed producer Syngenta for a formidable 43 billion ($53 billion; 50 billion euros). The European focus for Chinese takeover targets last year also saw Tencent, part of the increasingly dominant Chinese internet sector, splash out almost $9 billion in July on Finnish mobile game development company Supercell, easily Tencent\\'s largest foreign takeover so far. Acquisitions by Chinese firms across Europe last year totaled a whopping $76.5 billion, comfortably the largest merger and acquisition investment sum compared with the Americas and Asia. Companies from Western Europe, and Germany in particular, appear to stand out as the favored targets for takeover. Further examination of Chinese company merger and acquisition activity last year reveals a far more mature, professional approach in which takeover targets were screened with the utmost scrutiny before the launch of any takeover bid. Takeovers are also seen increasingly as partner brands - where considerable care is taken in post-acquisition integration. They are not simply public trophies. But will this Chinese company-led and European-focused M&A spree continue throughout 2017? In short, the answer is not only a resounding \"yes\", but even greater growth could take place. Here are some of the reasons behind what could be another record year for Chinese company takeovers: US President Trump. Despite huge uncertainty over the soon-to-be appointed president, it is clear that the US economy could become far less open for business with the outside world - Asia and China in particular. This could leave Europe, already the clearly favored target for overseas expansion by Chinese companies, an even more attractive place. Europe\\'s attractiveness is further enhanced when the likely industry targets for Chinese companies are considered. Top among the most high-profile takeovers last year are fashion, football, finance and technology, and major Western European economies offer a rich supply of established global brands in each of these areas. For example, Europe boasts three of the four widely recognized fashion capitals in the world: London, Paris and Milan. Consequentially many of the top global fashion brands are European. Chinese investment in football clubs really took off last year. For example, Chinese consumer electronics retailer Suning bought a majority stake in Italian football giant Inter Milan in June last year for $307 million, and one of the biggest English football clubs, Aston Villa, also became Chinese owned. Further forays into the most-developed football leagues around the world is highly likely, and once again European football dominates. The English Premier League, the German Bundesliga and the French Ligue1, as well as the Italian Serie A and the Spanish La Liga, contain many of the most highly valued football clubs in the world. Europe\\'s financial sector will also continue to prove attractive to potential Chinese investors. Takeovers in Europe\\'s ailing banking sector are seen as far less politically sensitive than the US banking industry. Global technology brands, much-coveted by Chinese industry as a vital aid in their modernization efforts, can also be found in abundance across Europe. This goes some way to explaining the attractiveness of German industries as potential takeover targets. German companies and the German government continue to welcome investment from China, and Chinese companies appreciate just how much the adoption of the most advanced technologies in their industry will improve their competitiveness. Of course there are concerns that too much outbound investment may lead to government attempts to curb activities in order to protect the currency. But such concerns do not stand up to scrutiny. Further transition toward the adoption across Chinese industry of a high-investment, high-quality and premium branding business culture will not happen if any kind of currency reliance continues. It is, therefore, unlikely that currency concerns will lead to a limitation of overseas involvement by Chinese companies - especially in acquisition activity. So what should European businesses make of this inexorable influx of takeovers by Chinese companies and how might they actually benefit? Crucial for European business has been the changing approach toward takeover targets by Chinese firms and the post-acquisition process. In both case, partnerships and a long-term perspective appear to have usurped the previously overeager, short-term acquisitive attitude of Chinese companies. Chinese companies and their leaders are no longer trophy hunting when it comes to takeovers of European businesses and their brands. Instead, they increasingly see growth via foreign brand acquisition as part of a clear, sustainable growth strategy, where long-term market share and customer satisfaction trump without trouble any short-term financial objectives. Chinese companies, while keen to learn from their European takeover targets, also appear to accept that established global brands should be left as individual product brands with no or little public association between the brand and its new corporate owner. During 2017 and beyond, therefore, European brands could benefit substantially from Chinese corporate takeover investment, which - if last year\\'s M&A activities are indicative of future activity - should be seen as much-needed fuel for brand building.

       " ['On the road again nan Orchestra\\'s European tour highlights traditional Chinese music for appreciative Western audiences Chinese conductor Hong Xia had her most memorable birthday in January last year when she led the Chinese Traditional Orchestra of the China National Opera & Dance Drama Theater in performances at the KKL in Lucerne, Switzerland, during the orchestra\\'s European tour. At the end of rehearsals, Wu Jiatong, CEO of Wu Promotion, the private promoter in China that organized the 2016 tour, stepped onto the stage with cake and flowers, wishing Hong a happy birthday and congratulating the orchestra. \"I totally forgot my birthday,\" Hong recalls. \"When Wu walked to me, I thought he was going to give a short speech. I was really surprised.\"   From Left: Musicians from Chinese Traditional Orchestra of the China National Opera & Dance Drama Theater, and Swiss audience, at the Culture and Convention Centre Lucerne in Switzerland.

Photos Provided to China Daily   What made Hong even more excited was that the KKL - or Culture and Convention Centre Lucerne - was the same venue where the late conductor Claudio Abbado (1933-2014) gave his final concerts. \"Abbado was one of my favorite conductors in the world, and I was honored to perform there,\" says Hong, a 1982 graduate of Shenyang Conservatory of Music. The concert turned out to be a great success, with a full house of more than 2,000 giving the orchestra a lengthy ovation. On Jan 27, Hong will lead the musicians in a performance at the KKL, again as part of a new European tour, which will kick off on Jan 16 in Budapest, Hungary. After KKL, they will travel to Erl, Austria, on Jan 29. \"I thought the main audience for a traditional Chinese folk music concert would be overseas Chinese. I didn\\'t expect that the majority of the audience would be Westerners,\" she says. \"Their warm feedback was very encouraging, and we are looking forward to our upcoming shows.\" The 2017 program will feature well-known music pieces, including The Great Wall Capriccio (Erhu Concerto) by Chinese composer Liu Wenjin (1937-2013), and Lingering Snow on The Broken Bridge, composed by Liu Xijin, in which a solo flutist performs with the folk orchestra. The orchestra is one of four national Chinese folk music orchestras that will tour abroad during the upcoming Chinese Spring Festival period, with the support of Wu Promotion. Titled the Grand Chinese New Year Concert, the tour will involve more than 300 Chinese musicians from the China National Opera & Dance Drama Theater, the Guangdong National Orchestra of China, the Zhejiang Traditional Orchestra and the Shaanxi Broadcasting Chinese Orchestra. They will visit 27 cities in 14 countries, including Kazakhstan, Russia, Poland, Hungary, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Finland and the United Kingdom. According to Wu, each performance will open with an introduction showing the uniqueness of traditional Chinese instruments. The idea is to enable Western audiences to better understand the music. \"The Grand Chinese New Year Concert is our oldest brand. It will celebrate its 20th anniversary next year,\" says Wu, who founded Wu Promotion with his father in 1991. The company currently produces more than 500 concerts and events annually in China and abroad. The company recently wrapped up a Cuba tour by the China Philharmonic Orchestra, which featured performances on Dec 15 and 16. Besides the Grand Chinese New Year Concert, one of the best-known projects is the annual Peking Opera Festival, which celebrated its eighth year in the Darwin Entertainment Centre, Australia, from Nov 29 to Dec 1. Wu recalls the first concert in the Vienna Musikverein in 1998 with the orchestra under the baton of conductor Chen Xieyang. \"Tickets sold out, and even the stairs in the venue were occupied by audience members. That was an unexpected success. Since then, we\\'ve made the Grand Chinese New Year Concert an annual event to display our traditional folk music to foreign audiences,\" says Wu, who was born in Beijing and pursued his music studies in Austria. So far, the grand concert has attracted about 300,000 concertgoers in some 20 countries. Presenting music with such instruments as the horse-headed fiddle from Inner Mongolia, as well as Cantonese melodies from the gaohu (a string instrument played with a bow), 13 Chinese folk music orchestras have performed as part of the project. The tour has stopped in Switzerland most frequently. In 2006, Wu Promotion brought China Traditional Orchestra Zhejiang to perform at the KKL in Lucerne under the baton of conductor Zhang Guoyong. It also visited five German cities and then went to Vienna, Amsterdam, Alexandria and Cairo. Wu says Swiss Television provided six hours of coverage for the event, including broadcasting the concert and presenting documentaries about traditional Chinese musicians and their instruments. More than 2,000 people saw the show in person, and even more were exposed via television to the great variety of sounds and musical instruments less known in the Western world. Since then, Wu Promotion has brought many Chinese orchestras and art troupes to perform in Switzerland. The company has also brought Swiss art troupes to China, including the Grand Theatre de Geneve Ballet Company, which toured China in April Wu Promotion has a three-year plan to bring the established Lucerne Festival to Shanghai from 2018 to 2020. The festival is a summer music event held annually in Switzerland. Founded in 1938, it is known for presenting famous orchestras, legendary conductors and celebrated soloists. During the 7th Peking Opera Festival, which was held in Geneva, Switzerland, last year, the president of Grand Theater de Geneva, Tobias Richter, discussed with Wu the idea of moving Opera des Nations to China after June 2018. Grand Theater de Geneva, built in 1876, is the largest opera house in the French-speaking area of Switzerland. Due to renovations that have been in progress for more than two years, a large wood-construction theater was purchased from France for temporary use. The temporary theater, which served as a venue for La Comedie-Francaise during its own renovation, was resettled in Geneva. The structure was expanded and revived under the name of Opera de Nations. The city of Geneva has agreed to gift the structure to China as a token of friendship in the long history of close ties between China and Geneva. \"This will be a historic event for both China and Switzerland, and it will serve as a cultural bond between the two countries,\" says Wu. \"I fully support this transfer of the Theatre des Nations from Geneva to Beijing, two cities already linked by a thriving partnership. It would represent one more excellent opportunity to increase and further deepen the relations between our two countries,\" says Jean-Jacques de Dardel, Swiss ambassador to China. \"This gift from Switzerland to China will allow many Swiss artists, musicians, orchestras, and dancers to perform for the Chinese public and strengthen the cultural ties between our two people in a structure representing the best in sustainable building methods. The fact that this theater could be rebuilt in Beijing, the capital city, is also a symbolic gesture illustrating the long lasting Sino-Swiss political relations.\" chennan@chinadaily.com.cn ( China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page5)'],\n",

Xi is to visit Switzerland from January 15-18 to deepen the relationship by announcing new measures to boost free trade, cultural exchanges, tourism and financial cooperation. Switzerland was the first Western nation to recognize the People\\'s Republic of China in January 1950. \"And from that time, our relationship, which is a historic one, has become stronger and stronger with the mutual trust we have rendered,\" he says. Switzerland recognized China\\'s market economy status in 2007. In July 2014, the two countries started to implement a free trade agreement and in April 2016, when former president of the Swiss Confederation Johann N. Schneider-Ammann visited China, both sides signed a \"partnership of innovation.\"    Federal Councillor Doris Leuthard took over from Schneider-Ammann as president of the Swiss Confederation from the beginning of this year. Leuthard also visited China in August last year. Burkhalter says currently both sides enjoy a \"very good and promising relationship\" with dialogue in various areas such as the economy, finance, environment, culture and human rights. He also says China and Switzerland have set examples on how to establish a win-win partnership by ironing out differences in their political and social systems. \"The Swiss side is willing to deepen cooperation with China to explore innovation and maintain the global free trade system,\" says Burkhalter. Burkhalter adds that his country will also work closely with China in various multilateral areas to become stabilizing factors of the increasingly complex global situation. fujing@chinadaily.com (China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page2)'],\n",
       " ['By working together, we\\'ll create better world nan Responsible business leaders need to create environments where ideas can connect and people can collaborate We see a lot in the media currently about division - between people, between nations, between ideologies. And it\\'s true, the world is moving in new, and sometimes unexpected, directions, and the existing order is being disrupted. But we must remember that the exchange of ideas can be a uniting force. Most of the world\\'s real innovations come not from individuals laboring away in isolation, or even from \"eureka\" moments, but from working together. The theme of this year\\'s annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, \"Responsible and Responsive Leadership\" highlights the vital role collaboration must play for us to best navigate the future. This year, British Telecommunications Plc will celebrate 180 years since the filing of the first patent for the five-needle electric telegraph - an innovation that laid the earliest foundations for today\\'s connected world and which underpins the fourth industrial revolution. The inventors of that device, Charles Wheatstone (a scientist) and William Fothergill Cooke (an entrepreneur) worked together to turn a great idea into what eventually became a global industry.  If I think about innovations from BT\\'s history, almost all were collaborative efforts. From the first live TV transmission across the Atlantic - a collaboration between AT&T\\'s Bell Labs and BT Labs - to the work we\\'re doing today on the next generation of ultrafast broadband technologies, the biggest successes have resulted from experts in different fields working together to achieve a common goal. That\\'s why companies today are increasingly taking a global \"open innovation\" approach. A major risk for large organizations, even ones such as ours who invest extensively in R&D is the \"not invented here\" syndrome - the chance that disruptive technologies will be ignored because they\\'re not pioneered in your own labs. BT\\'s innovation scouting teams and university partnerships in the UK, Silicon Valley, the MIT tech cluster, Abu Dhabi, China and other strategic locations around the world give us a global view, bringing the most innovative technologies into our business, wherever they originate. Collaboration between business and academia is a key component of \"open innovation\". As we\\'re gathering for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, let\\'s take a Swiss example of collaboration - CERN, with its 2,500 staff from 22 member states. The birthplace of the World Wide Web, CERN provides a global community of scientists with access to powerful facilities for experimentation, research, data processing and analysis. In 2013, the combination of these great minds and world-leading facilities in tunnels not far from Davos proved the existence of the Higgs boson, or \"God particle\", a fundamental building block of the universe. There\\'s a significant contingent of British brains involved in CERN. Britain is a melting pot of science and industry and, in a post-Brexit world, the UK will need to capitalize on its world-leading universities and build an innovation-led economy that lays a powerful foundation for future growth. Helping universities to focus their research and enormous intellectual capital on areas that have the potential for the creation of world-leading intellectual property is a role that businesses like ours increasingly need to step up to. Sustainable future growth needs purposeful innovation that is socially and commercially relevant. At a global level we see how things like the Sustainable Development Goals and Paris Agreement need to apply a collaborative and open approach to transcend national and political boundaries and develop innovative solutions to the big global issues of our time - extreme poverty, inequality and climate change. And every day we see examples of the collective power of people using social media. When used responsibly, this can be a force for good, supporting people in need and improving the state of the world. The first social media platforms were born of a few creative and collaborative minds less than a decade ago. They have since been adopted by billions of people and continue to evolve in their form and function. In 2016, Major Tim Peake, Britain\\'s first astronaut, used social media to bring the enormity of space closer to millions of schoolchildren in the UK and around the world. The International Space Station, which he visited, is one of the most ambitious international collaborations ever attempted and the most politically complex space exploration program ever undertaken. The largest space station ever constructed, it continues to be assembled in orbit and to date has been visited by astronauts of nearly 20 nationalities who make use of its research laboratories to improve our understanding of the world around us. So whether we look to the inky blackness of the sky or somewhere closer to home, we see time and again the power of the exchange of ideas and of working together across boundaries. Chance favors the connected mind; fortune favors the brave. In our modern world, responsive and responsible business leaders need to create environments where ideas can connect and people can collaborate. The author is the Chief Executive of BT Group.

       " ['A glimpse of the future nan Amid global uncertainties - not least a new US presidency - China plots a steady course of continued progress and reform President Xi Jinping is set to make a case defending globalization at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos. He will make clear the world\\'s second-largest economy\\'s commitment to being a key driver of world trade. The theme of the forum, which runs from Jan 17 to 20, is \"Responsive and Responsible Leadership\". Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the Geneva-based international organization, welcomed China\\'s involvement.    \"China is an emerging superpower, and we expect the country to play an increasingly active role as a responsive and responsible global leader,\" he says. \"Areas where we are already seeing this happen include catalyzing support for protecting the environment, acting as a champion for international trade and investment, supporting development and infrastructure finance and moving to develop and expand the global digital economy.\" Despite increasing fears of protectionism, economic ties can continue to flourish between industrializing Asia and developed Europe. On China\\'s part, everyone agrees that some big challenges remain - Trump provocations (or political distractions), domestic debt, or capital outflow to court potentially high returns from the overseas (mainly American) markets. The Central Economic Work Conference, held in Beijing in mid-December, was used to deal with exactly these challenges. China\\'s top-level decision-makers hold such a conference each December to map out development strategies and targets for the next year. Key targets will not be revealed until they are proposed to the National People\\'s Congress in early March, when targets become official.    But enough information can be obtained by China business watchers from the communique of the Central Economic Work Conference, which is in effect a carefully-worded statement of all major strategies for the next year. Some overseas commentators said what they read from the communique was a general approach of putting stability first and reform second, leaving the impression that Beijing will never muster enough resolve, even though its leaders have made great strides in building a more solid power base through an unprecedented anti-corruption campaign over the past few years. China has to take necessary precautions in reform. A lot of time is needed because it is a completely different game for local officials, who began their careers when GDP, and almost nothing else, served as the measure of their performance. In 2017, stability is still important, if not even more so now that a change in the US administration and its possible China policy are bringing in an additional sense of uncertainty. But stability doesn\\'t mean a standstill or no change. Reform won\\'t stop, even if it can\\'t proceed by leaps and bounds as it did in earlier days, such as when the special economic zones were just being launched in the 1980s. That was a time when China\\'s per capita GDP was only around $300. Now, it is $8,200. What is in the nation\\'s best interest is to progress with reform amid stability. Stability is guarantee for reform. The ongoing clean-government movement requires more than frequent reports and checks on officials\\' conduct in office and with public funds. They are also expected to carry out more economic tasks than just enlarging the local GDP. In the nation\\'s 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20), rigorous targets are set for social development and environmental protection. Some economic targets do not even require growth in numbers. One example is the task, assigned two years ago and yet to be completed, to slash industrial capacity - most noticeably the closure of some steel mills. It is aimed at helping the world\\'s steelmakers and reducing pollution. As serious readers will realize, the communique said, 2017 will be a more demanding year for reform. Cutting excessive industrial capacity, inventory, borrowing, operational costs and whatever shortcomings exist in management and production is a task to be continued from 2016. New tasks abound. One area to watch is reform of the public-private partnership scheme, sometimes called the mixed-ownership scheme, in state-owned enterprises. It is something that China has been talking about for the last few years but, since being included in the top leaders\\' 60-point decision on reform in 2013, it has been put into practice in only a small number of pilot projects, as with all reform programs in their initial stage. There were rumors that an overall PPP program was being drawn up for some national-level large SOEs. But, as the Chinese like to say, conditions were still not quite right for introducing PPP nationwide. By contrast, in 2017, according to the communique, some \"concrete steps\" will be taken in industries ranging from power generation and grid, oil and gas, railways, airlines, telecommunications and defense systems. Although accomplishment of the whole PPP program is likely to take a few years, once implemented it will amount to a second remaking of the Chinese SOE system, after its first major reform in the early 1990s, overseen by the premier Zhu Rongji. Even amid the bold changes of Zhu\\'s time, having private investment in defense companies was beyond anyone\\'s imagination. Apart from the above-mentioned changes, progress is planned in many areas. In general, it features two things. One is the domestic and the other the legal side of economic reform, especially protection of the property rights of companies and private citizens. Thanks to all the efforts since the 2008 global crisis to maintain stability while seeking development, China has developed a more balanced economic system. Its focus has grown from chasing ever-faster growth to building a lasting institution. The Central Economic Work Conference also pledged new efforts, including: In agricultural reforms, to focus on the definition and protection of land rights; In industrial reforms, to focus on boosting innovation and helping small and medium-sized enterprises; In the real estate market, to restrict speculative investment in urban residential housing units; In the regional development strategy, to focus on the country\\'s existing key urban belts; In the economic legal system, to strengthen the protection of property rights and redress wrong court rulings in this regard; In the financial system, to clarify fiscal interests and responsibilities between the central and local governments, while making regulation more effective in the financial market. Of course, the Central Economic Work Conference has painted a far-from-detailed picture of business in China in 2017. It is a framework, in which policies and the methods of their implementation can be adjusted according to conditions and possibilities. But the framework is expected to remain stable. It is especially important when, in all likelihood, China\\'s international environment will deteriorate if the Trump administration acts as its boss repeatedly pledged during his election campaign. As some observers say, what the world will see from the Trump administration will not be a simple version of isolationism, but unilateralism. Other economies, as a result, may feel pressured to take initiatives by themselves instead of counting on the US market. More than ever before, China will have to depend on its own economy for growth. But just as Marcus Aurelius said, time is everyone\\'s equal possession. While Trump plays his own unilateral game, other countries can also develop their games. Four years is not a short time, as long as there isn\\'t a major disaster. It is enough for China to make changes, and come out stronger as a more resourceful business partner for all countries in the world.

       " ['Federer has advantage with Chinese fans nan As Roger Federer goes full-tilt in preparation for the 2017 Australian Open he exudes confidence in a strong comeback after missing half of last year\\'s professional tennis season. His legion of Chinese fans can hardly wait. \"I really don\\'t know how long he can play, but I hope he can at least finish the 2017 season, because a five-month wait is quite long for us,\" says Lin Shengjie, a diehard fan of the 17-time singles Grand Slam champion from Switzerland. To fully recover from surgery on his left knee, Federer withdrew from the 2016 season after Wimbledon, taking five months off for the first time in his 20-year career. Lin, 26, is among his countless avid fans who turn almost every tournament he plays in China into a home-court event - cheering hard between points in matches, and gathering at his hotel lobby and practice court for autographs and adulation. Federer hasn\\'t opened a personal account on social media in China, but fans have voluntarily set up multiple online communities to share updates and to organize offline interactions with him once he makes himself available. What they ask in return is quite simple. \"I personally don\\'t mind if he gets another Grand Slam or not. Just watching him play is an enormous pleasure,\" Lin says.    Zhang Bendou, a veteran tennis writer at Titan Sports in China, attributes Federer\\'s undisputed recognizability in China to the fact that his career upswing coincided with the general ascent of professional tennis in the country since the early 2000s. \"He is popular worldwide, but the Chinese market is of special significance for him. He is a superstar who ascended to career prime during the period when the game began to be promoted and appreciated here,\" says Zhang, who has followed professional tennis for more than a decade. \"Lots of fans here fell in love with the game watching him. That\\'s a concrete emotional tie.\" Lin, who ran an online community for Federer fans from 2007 to 2009, agrees. \"Federer was the best player when tennis was growing dramatically in China,\" she says. \"The past decade saw a boom in the tennis market here. Federer was always at the top. Good timing,\" she says. Since first playing in China at the 2002 Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai, the year-end championship at the time, Federer has come to play in China 11 times, including in the 2008 Beijing Olympics. His flawless skills, elegant style and decent public image off the court soon captured the hearts of Chinese fans. Although not seen as an Olympic powerhouse, the Swiss athletes received boisterous cheers from the stands at the 2008 opening ceremony, mainly for Federer carrying the Swiss flag. \"Effortless yet deadly shots and smooth footwork - his tennis is beautiful to watch. You can\\'t stay immune. You have to admire his game,\" Zhang says. As the darling of fans worldwide, Federer never hesitates to express his gratitude for the support from Chinese fans. \"It\\'s great energy, I must say. It gives me unbelievable motivation. It inspires me to train hard and push further for that particular day, but also wanting to come back again next year, and again and again,\" the 35-year-old said during the 2013 Shanghai Masters. Along with Federer, fellow countrywoman Martina Hingis ranks among the best-known Swiss in China - also for accomplishments in tennis. Building her name on the pro tour ahead of Federer in the 1990s, Hingis still enjoys enduring popularity in China, as demonstrated by her appearance in Beijing to play doubles at the 2016 China Open. From the first-round of the Premier Mandatory women\\'s event, Hingis\\' game with partner Coco Vandeweghe, who is virtually unknown in China, was celebrated by boisterous Chinese fans who chanted her name while holding posters adorned with her Chinese nickname \"Swiss princess\". \"I am already in the Hall of Fame, and I\\'m still playing in different tournaments, so they still have some memories of me playing, even if it was 10 or 15 years ago. It shows an awareness of the history of the game,\" says the 36-year-old, who has won five Grand Slam singles and 12 doubles titles since 1997. sunxiaochen@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page3)'],\n",
       " ['Sino-Swiss links are in peak condition nan Business links between China and Switzerland are expected to be further enriched by a bilateral free trade agreement and investment in sophisticated service businesses and high-tech manufacturing over the next decade, say officials and business leaders from both sides. Shen Danyang, spokesman for China\\'s Ministry of Commerce, says that even though both the Chinese and Swiss economies have been affected by the global economic downturn, the degree of interdependence between the two remains stable in bilateral trade. Eager to enhance their earning abilities, China and Switzerland signed one of the highest-level and most comprehensive free trade agreements in July 2014, covering environmental issues, employment matters and intellectual property protection. Since the implementation of the China-Switzerland FTA, the volume of bilateral trade has turned around from dropping 27 percent year-on-year in 2014 to 1.7 percent growth to reach $44.26 billion (41.7 billion euros; 36.42) in 2015, data from the General Administration of Customs show. China mainly ships electrical equipment, metal products, furniture, organic chemicals and garments to Switzerland. Watches, industrial instruments and parts, medicine and healthcare products are the main products Switzerland exports to China.    \"Both sides are currently working on the next stage of the agreement,\" says Shen. \"The China-Switzerland FTA will exert a more positive influence on the promotion of trade and investment promotion and benefit more companies in the two countries.\" China\\'s exports to Switzerland in particular, maintained a favorable momentum in the first half of this year, while bilateral trade volume amounted to 100.25 billion yuan ($14.42 billion). China\\'s exports to Switzerland also reached 9.85 billion yuan, up 5.6 percent on a year-on-year basis during the six-month period. \"China will continue to export consumer goods in exchange for Switzerland\\'s high-tech products such as electronic goods, industrial parts and medical equipment. Most of the imports are complementary. Therefore, it isn\\'t direct competition,\" says Lin Shunjie, director-general of department of trade and investment promotion at the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. Sonova Group, the world\\'s largest hearing-care services provider by revenue, plans to enter more lower-tier Chinese cities and introduce its first 24-hour rechargeable hearing aid-the Phonak Audeo B-R-in China in 2017, as well as bringing its latest hearing aids for children and adults with severe hearing loss to the country in the future. \"Switzerland has always been viewed by Chinese consumers and the government as a country that develops high-tech products. Sonova has been investing in China for more than 10 years and we will continue to expand as we have in the past,\" says Albert Lim, senior vice-president of Sonova for the APAC region. \"Our latest project in China is an audiology training academy for the whole Asia-Pacific region. It has been established in our industrial campus in Suzhou,\" says Lim. The academy\\'s goal is to develop certified professional courses to continually upgrade and expand the skills of industry professionals. \"Capable Chinese companies are also inclined to acquire Swiss companies to gain cutting-edge technology, especially in chemistry, agricultural products, biology and precision instruments,\" says He Jingtong, a professor of international trade at Nankai University in Tianjin. zhongnan@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page4)'],\n",
       " [\"Supply-side reform good recipe for fixing economy nan Companies should improve competitiveness and branding to reduce reliance on expensive overseas brands China's economy has entered a new normal of slower economic growth, and it's encountering some challenges, including relatively low competitiveness of Chinese companies and overcapacity in some industrial sectors. The world economy, led by developed countries, has entered its own new normal phase in which it's difficult even for developed economies to recover. This has had an impact on China's exports. Protectionism is edging back into some countries, as multilateral cooperation - as envisioned by the Trans-Pacific Partnership, for example - is replaced with a more closed pattern of bilateral trade and investment mechanisms. To adapt to these new realities, the key for China is to revitalize its existing assets and make the best use of profitable incremental assets. The way forward includes the following: First, China needs more high-quality talent to replace low-cost labor Second, adopt a strategy of globalization as a primary driver of economic growth, replacing the old way of bringing in foreign investment Third, increase the efficiency of resource allocation, replacing the old model of using policy tools to support companies through price supports and tax subsidies. In this way, China could use the mechanisms of fair competition in the market to push Chinese companies to improve their own competitiveness and branding, which would naturally reduce their cost of buying overseas brands and technology at high prices, and could also effectively solve related problems. To realize that, the key is to deepen the supply-side structural reform in China. This includes six aspects: First, streamline administration and delegate power to lower levels, and mobilize the vitality of market players. When the market fails to function well, government should improve regulations and systems to ensure fair competition in the market and deal with fluctuations. Second, vigorously push forward the reform of state-owned enterprises to create an environment that encourages innovation and entrepreneurship. SOEs should say goodbye to the environment in which they could depend on low-cost labor, the spillover effect brought by foreign investment, price subsidies and the special competitive status the government has given them. Third, speed up the reform of China's fiscal and tax system, changing resource allocation, which feeds less into the real economy than into other sectors, such as finance. The government should consider coming up with property tax with the right timing, adjust tax rates of transactions involving financial assets, etc. For emerging companies and companies that are environmentally friendly, taxes could be reduced. Fourth, speed up the reform of China's financial system and banking system, to increase banks' and financial institutions' ability to serve the real economy, and to increase the ability to prevent financial crises. Fifth, make more contributions toward improving people's livelihoods, especially in the reform of the pension system, the healthcare system and the fair allocation of education resources. Sixth, during the structural reform, China needs to ensure that policies are compatible with reality and flexible in case they bring on unintended consequences. This requires China to have a good understanding of the complicated economic situation, both in China and globally. Industrial policies should avoid having all companies invest in the same industry or sector. Companies should have the flexibility to set a course in line with future economic development. At the micro level, market regulation should be loosened, while enhancing supervision, to create a market environment in which the fittest survive. Policies should also be targeted to improve investment in the markets and strengthen consumers' willingness to spend. China needs to have accurate industrial policies that encourage innovation and improve people's livelihoods, and also flexible policies that push forward the transformation and upgrading of companies. It needs carry out every reform policy in every link of supply-side reform, which is key to the quality and sustainability of the country's future economic development. Moreover, it should also be prepared for negative influences brought by black swan events that may take place in the world.

       " ['Calm voice emerges from global turmoil nan Academic believes Chinese president could be a stable influence at Davos as world events bring waves of uncertainty Rana Mitter believes President Xi Jinping could offer a voice for stability in an uncertain world at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos. The director of the Dickson Poon University of Oxford China Centre says Xi\\'s attendance at the summit - the first by a Chinese head of state - could signal the global order does not need to change, despite Donald Trump assuming office on Jan 20. \"I think (Xi\\'s attendance) could be interpreted as a vote of confidence by China in the current global order, which in 2017, may be sorely needed. Clearly last year was a bruising year,\" he says.   - Rana Mitter, director of the Dickson Poon University of Oxford China Centre, says President Xi Jinping\\'s attendance at the World Economic Forum in Davos this year could signal that the global order does not need to change, despite Donald Trump assuming office on Jan 20. Nick J.B. Moore / For China Daily  \"If you think of all the things that Davos stands for, it is about the maintenance of the liberal economic order and, broadly speaking, a quite progressive sort of social system too.\" President Xi\\'s decision to be at this year\\'s summit comes after the attendance of Vice-President Li Yuanchao last year and Premier Li Keqiang in 2015. China has also held its own Summer Davos annually since 2007, under the auspices of the WEF, alternating between host cities Tianjin and Dalian. Mitter, who was speaking in the front room of his Oxford home, believes that, given China\\'s engagement with Davos, Xi\\'s keynote address to the forum is likely to carry extra significance. The Chinese president is set to reaffirm his commitment to globalization and free trade at the meeting. \"I think a lot of people will be listening very carefully to what he has to say. It is likely to make more of a splash this year than it would have done a year ago. The world 12 months ago was really very different in terms of what was happening and any likely expectations.\" Davos has come to symbolize the global elite, bringing together politicians, heads of think tanks and large corporations, leading economists, academics and the media. It is this elite that has come under fire from populist movements that have led to the election of Donald Trump in the US and the UK\\'s Brexit decision. Mitter, 47 and regarded as one of the leading China experts in the West, believes voters should not fool themselves into thinking they are being offered anything other than a different form of elite.    \"What is mostly happening is that one elite is being replaced by another. Donald Trump has articulated the voices of many people who are clearly desperately unhappy with their current economic situation but it is not as if he, himself, is a horny-handed son of toil who has worked his way up through the coal mines.\" \"An awful lot of the anti-elites, who are themselves elites of a different sort, are offering supposed solutions that have very little substance to them whatsoever.\" One of the main discussion points at Davos is the risk of returning to a 1930s-style era of protectionism. President-elect Trump threatened during his election campaign to impose a 45 percent import tariff on Chinese goods \"This strikes me as highly unlikely in practice,\" says Mitter. \"China, famously, and the US are in the World Trade Organization, which exists precisely to try and prevent this sort of trade war escalating. The idea that the US and China can simply launch a trade war against each other without outside intervention does not reflect the reality of the situation.\" \"There are an awful lot of other actors who would have something to say about this, including the European Union, Canada, Australia and the UK, once it leaves the EU of course.\" Climate change is also likely to be high on the agenda at Davos, with the hard-won agreement drawn up at the 2015 Paris summit, which both China and the US ratified, seemingly under threat from the new US administration. \"He hasn\\'t actually said he will abandon it. Like many other things, when you peruse the grammar very carefully, he has allowed himself more wriggle room than is immediately clear from the rhetoric,\" adds Mitter. \"It wouldn\\'t actually be that easy to simply dump the climate change deal because, by doing so, he would be dumping every single one of America\\'s allies, who have also signed up for it. He will be aware there will be a price to pay for that as well.\" The future of the European Union will be another debating point at the Swiss ski resort. The UK is set to invoke Article 50 at the end of March, which will trigger the start of Brexit negotiations. The French have their general election in May, with Front National leader Marine Le Pen likely to get into the final round of voting and with a chance of winning the presidency. \"If Le Pen does win, that will put a bomb under the structures of the European Union. I think it would put an end to the great European project, at least in its current form,\" says Mitter. The academic says that even if conservative candidate Francois Fillon is elected in France and Angela Merkel is returned in Germany, the EU still faces major uphill challenges. \"It still has the euro crisis, it still has the Italian banks problem and it still has relatively sluggish growth. Its structural problems will not have been resolved.\" Mitter, the son of academics originally from West Bengal, studied Chinese at Cambridge and was a Kennedy scholar at Harvard before embarking on an academic career. He has written a number of books on China, including the highly acclaimed China\\'s War With Japan, 1937-45: The Struggle for Survival, which has been translated into Chinese. He combines being director of the Oxford University China Centre, which he is contracted to until 2019, with being a presenter of the BBC Radio 3 arts program Free Thinking. Mitter, who attended Davos last year as a speaker, believes another of the major talking points there will be the future of US foreign policy under the new administration. \"A pre-Trump America, or any other president, would be concerned about things such as security in Europe. I suspect there is at least some part of the Trump administration that really doesn\\'t regard that as a first level American priority,\" he says. The future of trade within Asia itself will also be debated. The incoming president has already announced he will withdraw the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Some have suggested that China may want to form its own alternative bloc, possibly built around RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership), an ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) initiative. Mitter, however, believes that President Xi would much prefer to form a trading bloc that included the United States rather than going it alone \"I\\'m totally convinced by the idea that China would much rather have the US inside, whatever structure it is.\" The academic maintains that Xi is likely to provide a reassuring presence at Davos in a world of change. Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the Geneva-based international organization, has already said the president will outline his country\\'s evolving role in the new global structure. \"Chinese politics is probably likely to be much more predictable and stable during 2017, certainly compared to an untried US President, the start of Brexit negotiations and the structural problems of the European Union. All of these are the political unknowns that will begin to unfold over the next 12 months,\" says Mitter. andrewmoody@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page7)'],\n",
       " ['Factory of the future: Clean, high-tech nan Get ready for a complete rethink of the workplace as innovation takes manufacturing to a new level Factories have long held a place in the popular imagination, not just as sources of employment and community prosperity, but also as hectic, noisy, grimy and polluting facilities where thousands of people are employed in largely low-skill jobs. Today\\'s factories are changing. Breathtaking advances in technology, automation and globalization are transforming how and where manufacturers plan, construct, operate and integrate their factory networks. They are also ushering in significant operational, political and societal changes. From rust belt America to rural India and China, a chorus of voices is struggling to understand: How are technologies changing how we produce and distribute products? Are automation and free trade taking away valuable factory jobs? What type of skills will be required? How can communities prosper in the face of new production technologies? How and when should manufacturers upgrade their legacy equipment to embrace new technologies to boost yields and efficiency for greater profits or simply to remain competitive? These are the questions we\\'ve been pondering as we\\'ve worked as a Knowledge Partner on the World Economic Forum\\'s Future of Production initiative. Businesses, governments and society alike must understand the technological dynamics at play and collaborate to ensure that tomorrow\\'s factory towns prosper.    What will the factory of the future look like? The answers will come from the factory floor, where new technologies like 3D printing, advanced robotics, the internet of things, artificial intelligence, wearable devices and virtual and augmented reality are converging to create new value, enabling the hyperefficient and flexible factory of the future. The value created is real: Large global producers have increased efficiency and reduced costs by up to 30 percent across all operations, driven by improvements in overall operating efficiency, lower inventory, energy and water costs and reduction in incidents involving safety. While the pace of change, and how these changes will propagate across networks, will differ by industry and country, the factory of the future is a more digital, more virtual and more resource-efficient space. It is an environment that is more connected - both in terms of information availability and machines speaking to and directing each other. Automation, simulation, visualization and analytics are deployed more widely to eliminate waste and increase efficiency in material yields, energy consumption, effort and time. In particular, factories of the future have three common overarching characteristics: Digital shop floor processes that are connected, automated and flexible. The internet of things and connectivity combined with analytics and artificial intelligence will improve asset efficiency, decrease downtime and unplanned maintenance, and allow manufacturers to uncover new sources of value in services. By employing digital twins, simulations and virtual reality, designers and operators will virtually immerse in interactive media to optimize design, production processes and material flows.    New relationships between operators and machines. Technologies are changing the nature of work and skills required from operators. Robotics are automating most of the \"dull, dirty and dangerous\" tasks and, increasingly, collaborative robots are moving out of the cage to work side-by-side with operators. Augmented reality and wearables are also changing how operators train, assemble and make decisions on the shop floor; increasing flexibility, productivity and quality. Labor will actually remain cost-effective in many arenas, as technology allows workers to significantly improve their productivity even as overall numbers decline. Some human-cyber combinations will likely remain the dominant cog in factories for several years to come, certainly well into the coming decade. Structure, location, and scale of factories. The factory of the future is hyperefficient and sustainable, increasingly modularized with interchangeable lines that can be easily reconfigured for multiple production batches. Digital production technologies will allow software developers, product designers and production technicians to work in open, airy environments. As technology diminishes the role of low-cost labor and lowers the threshold of economies of scale, distributed manufacturing will become the norm, with producers augmenting their traditional production footprints with smaller and more flexible units located next to points of consumption, allowing them to meet local requirements with a more responsive supply chain. These more localized, more energy-efficient, lower-waste factories will contribute to advances in the circular economy. The author is a partner in the New York office of A.T.

       " ['Xi expected to bring a steady voice to Davos nan Fighting trade protectionism and anti-globalization, as well as boosting confidence in the Chinese economy, will be high on President Xi Jinping\\'s agenda as he becomes the first top Chinese leader to attend and address the World Economic Forum annual meeting, observers say. Xi will pay a state visit to Switzerland on Jan 15 to 18 and attend the forum\\'s annual meeting in Davos on Jan 17 alongside corporate and political leaders, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said on Jan 10. The meeting was attended by Premier Li Keqiang in 2015 and by Vice-President Li Yuanchao last year. Xi will deliver a keynote speech when attending the meeting, Vice-Foreign Minister Li Baodong told a news briefing in Beijing. Xi\\'s attendance has attracted great attention amid sluggish international trade and investment, the rise of protectionism and its impact upon the multilateral trade mechanism, the diplomat noted. By participating in the meeting, the Chinese leader aims to explain China\\'s views and positions, and to offer a useful response \"to concerns of the international community about economic globalization\", Li said. China plans to analyze the deep-seated factors behind the problems of world economic growth and seek to find directions and pathways that point on the way out, Li added. Widespread political reshuffling across the globe has dampened investor confidence and added uncertainty to the already sluggish growth of the world economy since the economic crisis in 2008. World political and economic leaders also are anticipating Xi addressing the health of the world\\'s second-largest economy in the wake of fluctuations in the yuan and Beijing\\'s measures to rein in systematic financial risks, experts say. The vice-foreign minister said that Xi, during the meeting, will respond to the world\\'s focus on hotspot issues of Chinese economy and boost understanding of Chinese economic policy. \"China is ready to embark on in-depth discussions with various parties to jointly tackle major global challenges and promote the healthy, stable development of the world economy,\" Li said. Ruan Zongze, vice-president of the China Institute of International Studies, says Xi\\'s first trip to the Davos meeting is to address \"the widespread lack of confidence over the prospects for the world economy and the lack of viable solutions\". Events last year, including the United Kingdom\\'s vote to leave the European Union, \"showcase the downward pressure of the global economy since the crisis in 2008\", and \"the gathering momentum against globalization and in favor of protectionism\", Ruan says. The world is expecting China to deliver a strong message against trade protectionism at the forum because the voices of smaller countries have not been enough of a counterbalance, Ruan adds. The forum will also be attended by such figures as British Prime Minister Theresa May and US Vice-President Joe Biden. Chen Fengying, a senior researcher on the world economy at China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, says: \"We should make it clear (at the forum) that the existing international economic cooperative mechanisms should not be changed because of the change in state leaders.\" Since the world economy and globalization are \"at a crossroad and a turning point\", it is time for Xi to demonstrate China\\'s power and duty as a major developing country, Chen says. Xi\\'s comments are also highly anticipated because China\\'s annual central economic work conference recently wrapped up, Chen notes. \"China\\'s economy is also at a crossroads. We could get either sustained growth or massive risks breaking out,\" Chen says. Huang Yiping, a member of the central bank monetary policy committee and an economist at Peking University, says China\\'s current priorities include eliminating systematic financial risks and stabilizing economic growth.

       " [\"Investment helps promote global recovery nan As voices of protectionism rise, Chinese companies maintain a steady hand with their mergers and acquisitions overseas The voices of nativism, protectionism and populism have become louder and stronger, making the global need for inclusive development more obvious as the pace on the road to recovery in recent years has been slow. Global trade and investment was weaker in 2016 than in the previous year. Acceleration of economic growth is the first step in promoting inclusive development. Then comes sharing the achievement. The best way to accelerate economic growth is to encourage global investment. Investment has become a key engine of recovery. Data from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development says that global trade increased 2.7 percent year-on-year in 2015, with foreign direct investment increasing 38 percent to $1.7 trillion, meaning that investment has become a major growth force. However, global investment remained slow in 2016 - far less than the 2007 level of $2.28 trillion. Foreign direct investment in 2016 is expected to come in at $1.5 trillion or $1.6 trillion, or 10 to 15 percent below the 2015 level. In other words, the global economic recovery remains fragile at a low level of investment. All of the above means we need more investment.  Two years ago, some economists in the West complained that China's economic slowdown dragged down the growth of the global economy and triggered a drop in bulk commodity prices. However, it ignored the demand created by the rapid growth of China's outbound foreign investment. In 2015, China's outbound FDI reached $145.7 billion, the second-largest total in the world, and outbound M&A accounted for nearly 40 percent of that. In 2016, outbound foreign direct investment will reach more than $170 billion, according to official data, and the value of Chinese corporate outbound M&A will top the world, according to Morning Whistle Group. Nowadays, complaints about Chinese economic growth have relaxed, even though it has slowed further. But European investment protectionalism against FDI by Chinese companies - as seen in the voices of critics, legislation and other measures - has been increasing gradually. Some M&A deals were stopped because of resistance from the European countries' governments or public opinion. Such criticisms and complaints are baseless, especially in the M&A field, because those deals will give both China and Western countries a better future. In fact, as some critics said, Chinese investors came for technology. Data from Morning Whistle show that 44 percent of M&A deals proposed by Chinese enterprises focused on gaining advanced technologies, 30 percent on gaining market channels and 10 percent on brand recognition. Chinese investors paid a premium for such M&As. In addition to making attractive offers, the Chinese investors also brought strategic resources - such as market opportunities in China - to their Western partners. The deals will increase jobs in both sides and bring win-win results. Some Western countries insisted that those deals, proposed at such high prices, were supported by subsidies from the Chinese government - low-interest loans, for example. They didn't seem to know that about 70 percent of Chinese M&A deals were proposed by private companies, that more than 70 percent of Chinese M&A deals were conducted by Chinese-listed companies or that the high purchase prices were actually supported by Chinese private companies' shareholders in a stock market whose average price-to-earnings ratio is more than double that of European companies. In other words, these deals deserved such values, in combination with Chinese stock market valuation, and actually provided a channel for Western investors or owners to share in the premium Chinese capital market. It wasn't subsidies. More Chinese companies tried to raise funds in overseas markets because the cost of financing is much lower than at home. Chinese enterprises hope they can build capital channels and financing platforms in overseas markets to reduce their financing costs and increase their investment and financing ability. Western complaints about the purchase prices offered by Chinese companies - which may be very high and thus attractive to the targets - come from competitors' jealousy, which will ultimately ruin the mutual benefits. It is not fair play. Chinese companies' investments in overseas markets will remain strong in 2017, boosted by technological upgrades, a decrease in the rate of domestic economic growth, the valuation gap between China and Western stocks, US Fed interest rate increases, etc., but growth will slow for both foreign and domestic entities. Companies will pay more attention to improvements in the global value chain when proposing overseas M&A deals, and investment in Belt and Road countries is encouraged and supported. The government didn't intend to prevent normal outbound FDI through tighter foreign exchange rules; rather, it aimed to improve sustainability and to prevent money laundering. The pressure on both the price and volume of Chinese foreign exchange reserves can be expected to further relax in 2018 - or earlier - depending on the US federal interest rate cycle. Structural adjustments will help. So we forecast that the driving forces of growth will remain steady. Europe was the first destination that abstracted Chinese investment. From 2014 to 2016, the United States, Britain, Australia, Germany, South Korea and Canada topped the list of M&A activity with Chinese companies. The companies will take Europe as their first investment target in 2017, according to Morning Whistle. We hope both sides can open their minds and cooperate well to share the China premium and other benefits. We also hope Europe will remain the first choice for Chinese corporate M&A activity. The recovery of the world economy needs inclusive, fair and green investment. We hope the investments from Chinese companies will bring more opportunities to the destination countries, and promote inclusive development. We also noticed that the Chinese government is trying to absorb more foreign investment and giving more freedom to local governments at the beginning of 2017. We appreciate the help of Western investment in promoting China's economic growth over the past 30 years. And we believe that Chinese investment overseas will bring a better future to the world.

Fu Jing / China Daily  \"Both sides will actively explore ways to upgrade the free trade agreement,\" he told China Daily. \"Leaders of both countries will join hands to send a strong signal against any form of global protectionism that blocks trade and investment flows.\" In addition to beefing up the trade relationship, Geng says, both sides will announce new measures to boost cultural exchanges, tourism and financial cooperation. During the trip, Xi will deliver a keynote speech at the annul meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos. He is scheduled to visit the Lausanne-based International Olympic Committee and the headquarters of the World Health Organization in Geneva. He will also speak at the United Nations Office in Geneva before wrapping up his first overseas tour of 2017. Geng says both sides are determined to set an example on free trade, which should be followed by the European Union and other global players to pave the way for faster growth of the global economy. The two countries\\' free trade agreement, which waives most tariffs on goods, took effect in July, 2014. Talks began in 2011 and the two sides sealed the deal in 2013. Talks with Norway are ongoing, but Iceland has already entered into a free trade agreement with China. The European Union, meanwhile, insists that it should conclude a bilateral investment agreement with China before the two sides start free trade talks, though some of its member states are eager to clinch a deal with China. Geng says more countries have shown interest in free trade talks with China lately, mainly because Switzerland has already benefited from the partnership through export growth. Official figures from the Swiss government showed that overall exports slowed in October and November last year, but export volume to China maintained double-digit year-on-year growth in the same period. Exports to China increased 11.5 percent year-on-year in November, while the rise in October was 24.1 percent. \"Such rosy results have led more countries to become interested in free trade talks with China, and some of them even asked me for the text of the agreement between China and Switzerland,\" Geng says. \"I am sure that every country that enters such a trade arrangement with China will become a winner.\" Geng says China has been restructuring its investment and trade-led economy toward consumption and innovation, creating tremendous opportunities for imports. In December, the European Union, United States and Japan, the leading global economies, refused to fulfill a promise made 15 years ago when China joined the World Trade Organization to recognize China as an equal trade partner. But Switzerland joined dozens of WTO members in recognizing China\\'s market economy status back in 2007. Apart from efforts to boost trade, the leaders will also upgrade their political relationship, Geng says. Switzerland was the first Western country to establish diplomatic relations with the People\\'s Republic of China in 1950. In April, former president of the Swiss Confederation Johann N. Schneider-Ammann visited China. \"Within less than a year, President Xi is returning a state visit, and he is only visiting Switzerland during this tour, which indicates how much importance China has attached to the bilateral relationship,\" Geng says. fujing@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/13/2017 page3)'],\n",
       " [\"Foreign links key to future success nan Overseas partnerships offer lucrative and beneficial opportunities for both sides, says veteran consultant Many countries should look to China's successful record of attracting foreign investment and using it to help develop its economy, a veteran consultant says. Michael Enright, director of the Hong Kong-based strategy consultancy Enright, Scott & Associates, says there are some important lessons for other countries to learn from China. He was in Beijing recently launching his new book, Developing-China: the Remarkable Impact of Foreign Direct Investment, which demonstrates the enormous impact that FDI has on China. The first lesson for other countries to learn is that foreign investment can be a very powerful engine for development, Enright says.   Michael Enright, at the launch ceremony for his new book in Beijing. Provided to China Daily  Second is that using foreign investment as an engine of development can be managed, but a country has to develop not only capabilities in the workforce but also must develop the administrative and governmental capabilities to administer and manage a more advanced economy that includes foreign-invested enterprises. The book says that FDI accounts for only a bit over 2 percent of China's gross capital formation. But if the FDI and the operations of foreign investment enterprises and the ripple effects of the supply chains and employee spending are also counted, the impact is 33 percent of China's GDP. Enright thinks that estimate is still low. He said the spillover effect of foreign investment is uncountable. For example, its impact on Chinese companies through the transfer of technology, the adoption of modern management techniques, and the training of tens of thousands of Chinese professionals through corporate training and university programs based on a Western model. Foreign enterprises also help create distribution and supplier networks in China; help educate tens of thousands of professionals; give Chinese companies access into international markets (as foreign enterprises carry 75 percent of all of China's international cargo); bring in world-class environmental standards; and cooperate on social responsibility standards. Enright says that when China started its reform and opening up in the 1980s, its economy lagged behind many other countries. A smart thing China did rather than trying to reinvent all the business models and technologies to develop a more advanced economy by itself was to attract good ideas and good companies from around the world to China. The country has its own historical circumstances, and has recognized that to develop its economy, all the good ideas cannot come from one place. It really needs to tap into global ideas, global sources of capital and global expertise, Enright says. Moreover, China has enormous potential with its large population, as well as its skills and capabilities, he says. In Enright's view, China's use of foreign capital has been managed carefully, step by step, to absorb foreign investment without experiencing many of the potential downsides. Although there are some foreign companies that think China has not opened up enough, he says any country would open only as much as it is comfortable with. What most foreigners don't understand is that given China's unique history, from the late 1950s to late 1970s, included basically no foreign investment. So when it started to open up, it had to gradually create the necessary administrative, regulatory and legal frameworks to support it.  But the more a country opens, the more investment and high-quality investment it can obtain, so China should be more confident and open to additional foreign investment, Enright says. While foreign investment benefits China, he says China has also brought many things to foreign investors. One of those has been the market. The stereotype outside China is that foreign companies come to China to make things with cheaper labor to send back overseas. That was true in the 1980s and maybe the first half of 1990s, he says. But foreign companies are now primarily in China to sell to China. Foreign companies sell far more in China than they export from China. Enright says that China did offer relatively inexpensive labor to the world in the early days of its opening-up, but that is changing. Increasingly, multinational companies are putting R&D facilities and their most advanced manufacturing facilities in China. In the old days they were looking for low-cost labor. Now they are looking for highly qualified labor, for skilled professionals, skilled scientists and that helps the companies, and it helps develop the Chinese economy as well, he says. Foreign companies in the past made their plans based on 10 percent annual GDP growth; now they have to adjust, he added. At the same time, Chinese companies have become more experienced and can better identify their markets and use high-class technology, which results in tougher competition in the domestic market. Those are two main mechanisms that will cause the multinationals to rethink, he says. Enright says China still has great potential, but many foreign companies haven't realized it yet. He took the Belt and Road Initiative as an example, as it will cover a large population in more than 60 countries. It is a massive opportunity, and the potential is not only China but also Southeast Asia, South Asia, Central Asia and Europe, because it proposes to build so much connecting infrastructure, he says. He says that the Chinese government has recognized that it is impossible for Chinese companies and Chinese financial institutions to do all the projects all by themselves, and certain technology and expertise will be required from foreign partnerships. In addition, many of the places along the Belt and Road are not places where Chinese companies have experience, but foreign companies do and that provides good opportunities for partnerships, too. But the key is: To partner successfully outside China, those companies also have to be partnering with the part that is inside China, Enright says. For China's Manufacturing 2025 strategy, if you look at the leading technologies behind advanced manufacturing, the complete factory of automation systems, the internet of things, machine-to-machine communication systems right now the leaders in many of the technologies are outside of China, he says. If China really wants to develop to be the world's leading advanced manufacturing center, a lot of cooperation with foreign companies would be good and good business for the foreign companies, he says. He says there is a great deal of confusion in the international community, because it is not clear what approach is best to get involved. There is also some fear that many initiatives might be exclusive to Chinese companies so it is best if China can work out the details soon. Enright says that as Chinese companies go international, there will be more need of mutual understanding over the next few years about what Chinese companies are allowed to do in foreign countries and what foreign companies are allowed to do in China. China became a major exporter, but with relatively few Chinese companies actually understanding the international market. And that is going to be one area in which working with foreign companies or allying with foreign companies is going to be critically important, he says. Certainly for the developing countries, capital, expertise and infrastructure investment from China could make major contribution to development. In the more advanced countries, Chinese investment is also contributing more to developing infrastructure, and it is creating need jobs. chenyingqun@chinadaily.com.cn ( China Daily European Weekly 01/06/2017 page32)\"],\n",
       " ['Roses have scent of money nan Jewelry, perfume, fashion and accessories certainly fit the bill as luxury brands. But could fragrant flowers, like roses, be added to that category? Definitely, according to Pu Yi, founder and CEO of roseonly, a Beijing-based startup formed in 2013. \"Just like Tiffany in the US, and Mikimoto in Japan, roseonly is gradually becoming a new signature luxury brand embraced by the country\\'s middle class. We want to become a homegrown Chinese luxury brand,\" says Pu. Such an aspiration may be sound ambitious but is it realistic? The company, which spells its name with a lower-case \\'r\\', has had unprecedented success in China selling premium roses imported from Ecuador in South America to upwardly mobile, newly wealthy upper- middle-class consumers. Its bouquets are among the hottest gift choices for young Chinese.   - A sales representative at roseonly arranges product samples at one of its outlets in Beijing. Feng Yongbin / China Daily  Prices range from 999 yuan ($143; 138 euros; 117) for an 11-rose bunch to 9,999 yuan for a 99-rose bouquet. The startup expects the sales in 2016 via outlets in multiple cities and online stores to reach around 250 million yuan, up from 130 million yuan in 2015, 61 million yuan in 2014 and 14.6 million yuan in 2013. It expects sales to exceed 300 million yuan this year. Annual sales revenue has been surging, probably due to roseonly\\'s unique packaging and marketing, which emphasizes not the imported roses themselves but a once-in-a-lifetime expression of love for one special person (who is, usually, the buyer\\'s girlfriend, fiancee or wife). Information about buyers and bouquet recipients is stored in a database at the time of purchase. This information cannot be changed later. That means a customer can buy at roseonly only once - no repeat purchases by the same customer for a different recipient is allowed. This seemingly self-defeating strategy has paid off - the sales figures are proof. If more proof is needed, twice in recent months, roseonly witnessed sales surges. The latest was during the Christmas-New Year week. \"We\\'ve seen a 40 percent rise in sales during the Christmas season,\" Pu says. The earlier spike was around the Qixi festival, or the Chinese Valentine\\'s Day, in August. \"If my boyfriend buys me an expensive roseonly bouquet, it contains more than a bunch of roses; it signals his loyalty and a reassuring promise,\" says Wang Qin, 23, a Beijing resident. Investors may have caught a whiff of potential profits in roses. Angel investors chipped in with funds two months after roseonly launched. Tencent, owner of the WeChat app, poured $10 million into the startup. In 2014, IDG capital and Accel Partners invested more than $10 million (9.6 million euros; 8.1 million), followed by 190 million yuan from Genesis Capital, Prosperity Investment and Echo Capital. All that money over the years has helped roseonly to open 28 outlets in Beijing, Shanghai and other first- and second-tier cities. It is the biggest flower vendor on Tmall, Alibaba\\'s online marketplace.    The florist is now valued at $100 million, according to TechinAsia. Not surprisingly, roseonly wants to go beyond the Chinese mainland. It plans to open shops in Malaysia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea and Singapore in the years to come. Pu describes the brand\\'s target demographic as men and women between the ages 25 and 45, with stable incomes and an appreciation for high-quality goods and affordable luxuries. According to a report by McKinsey, generational change and the rising prosperity of inland cities will power consumption for years to come. By 2022, more than 75 percent of China\\'s urban consumers will earn 60,000 yuan to 229,000 yuan a year, the McKinsey report says. \"There will be not only challenges but also plenty of opportunities for companies whose strategies reflect China\\'s new constellation of rising incomes, shifting urban landscapes, and generational change,\" says Pu. To ride the trend, roseonly has launched new offerings such as bouquets of exotic flowers, which it bundles with jewelry pieces in exquisite gift packages. \"We will expand the business to the high-end gift market,\" says Pu. \"We\\'ve so far come up with many love-related jewelry gifts like bracelets, necklaces and earrings, and will cooperate more with some of the world\\'s renowned designers and celebrities. \"The jewelry market has more potential than the flower market, and the gift market has even more.\" Most of roseonly\\'s jewelry gifts are designed to be rose-related, and target younger women and girls. The company also sells tailor-made gifts during peak seasons, such as a snowman necklace during Christmas and limited-edition designer jewelry associated with celebrities.

       " ['Warning of tight times ahead for insurers nan Analysts warned on Jan 2 that insurers\\' profit margins will be tighter this year, in an environment of low interest rates and increased regulation to contain financial risks. The China Insurance Regulatory Commission recently tightened its regulation of the ownership structure of the nation\\'s insurers. The measure was adopted to safeguard the insurers\\' role in the capital market as long-term providers of protection, rather than short-term speculators. The regulator lowered the maximum stake in an insurer a single shareholder can own from 51 percent to 33 percent in recently released draft rules currently open to public discussion. The regulator also banned life insurers from opening new branches if short-term insurance policies account for more than 50 percent of their total premiums on a quarterly basis. \"Tighter regulation, together with the low interest rates, will further constrain the business growth of insurers. Bigger players will be less affected than smaller ones, which may need to adjust their strategy accordingly,\" says Wei Tao, an analyst at BOC International Holdings. Insurers\\' total premiums were expected to exceed 3 trillion yuan ($431.4 billion; 411.6 billion euros; 350.8 billion) in 2016, a 25 percent increase year-on-year, according to analysts\\' forecasts. The outstanding value of investment by insurance funds had already exceeded 13 trillion yuan as of November. Aggressive stake bidding by insurance funds in the stock market has caught the regulator\\'s attention, amid serious concerns that this trend will result in greater volatility that could endanger the broader financial system. Shen Juan, an analyst at Huatai Securities, says in a research note that, given the tighter regulatory control, insurers are likely to rely more on sales of traditional long-term insurance products and adopt less aggressive investment strategies to manage their funds. The regulator\\'s crackdown on high cash-value products will constrain the premium growth of life insurers this year, with insurers exposed to significant asset-liability duration mismatches facing a more acute challenge, according to credit ratings agency Fitch Ratings Inc. lixiang@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/06/2017 page26)'],\n",

Citing false bidding prices from the Bloomberg foreign exchange system, media reported a day ealier that the value of the onshore renminbi against the US dollar dropped below 7 yuan, sparking a fresh round of concerns over a potential acceleration in the currency\\'s depreciation. The People\\'s Bank of China, the central bank, immediately responded to the reports in a late-night statement, condemning them for being \"irresponsible\" and confirming that the exchange rate of the renminbi has remained stable at between 6.9500 to 6.9666. The overall expectation by analysts is that a weaker yuan could help boost export-oriented sectors such as commodities, textiles, shipping and chemicals. Yu Jianlong, secretary-general of the China Chamber of International Commerce, says the depreciation of the renminbi will enable companies to put their export volume on a firmer footing. But some argued that the effect on boosting exports could be limited, as the real exchange rate of the renminbi against a basket of currencies has not depreciated as much as the value against the dollar. Xiao Lisheng, a senior finance researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, says that a weaker currency would mean greater risk-hedging costs for companies that plan to borrow dollar-denominated debt and seek to make outbound investments. \"The PBOC\\'s prompt response highlighted the fragile market sentiment toward the value of the renminbi,\" Xiao says. \"The pressure will likely be greater next year (2017) for China\\'s policymakers, as they are facing a tough option of either maintaining currency stability with tighter monetary policy or maintaining growth with a more accommodative policy.\" The value of the Chinese currency has depreciated against the dollar by more than 7 percent this year, hitting a record low in eight years. Some economists believe that it is only a matter of time before the currency falls below 7 yuan per dollar given the tightening cycle of the US Federal Reserve and decreasing investment returns at home. \"The depreciation of the renminbi means greater costs for currency conversion,\" says Xie Delong, vice-general manager of Sichuan Dawn Machinery Co.

Announcing the funding details, CEO Chen Xuefeng says his company will use a large proportion of the investment to further support two new business lines. One focuses on growth in smaller cities, by partnering with local recycling stores. The other is to encourage consumers to rent new smartphones from the platform instead of buying them.    The company\\'s president, Zheng Pujiang, outlined the geographical rollout. \"To date, Aihuishou has secured the market in first-tier and second-tier cities,\" he says. \"Third-tier and smaller cities will be our next strategic priority.\" Since August, the group has established links with assorted partners in these markets. Aihuishou, established in 2011, recycles old electronics such as cellphones, laptops, cameras and assorted hardware. The platform then resells most of the used goods after cleaning and testing, and channels the low-value ones to professional recycling centers. To date, the platform has set up five operations centers and more than 200 recycling stores nationwide. In 2016, the average monthly revenue of Aihuishou exceeded 200 million yuan.

By comparison, the global smartphone market grew by just 1 percent, research firm International Data Corp estimates. According to Sheng, the Shenzhen-based company has done a good job in cracking the high-end segment. Shipments of its premium handset P9 series exceeded 10 million units within eight months. \"But costs have outpaced its revenue and gross margin growth after Huawei wrote big checks for marketing,\" he says.

BCEG, which was established in Beijing in 1953, already has a presence in many developing countries. It expanded into Western markets in 2007 by building a hospital in Dallas, Texas. BCEG also worked on other projects in the US, Canada and Australia. Examples include a retirement home in Los Angeles and a commercial center in Australia. BCEG\\'s first project in Europe was Airport City Manchester, with the company responsible for 50 percent of the construction work, alongside the British contractor Carillion. It is also an equity partner, investing a 20 percent stake into the project.    Spread over an area of 465,000 square meters, the project includes construction of offices, hotels, advanced manufacturing facilities, and logistics and warehousing facilities. Yu says his team has already made significant progress on the basic infrastructure work for the project, aiming to finish the majority of infrastructure work in 2017. It has already started designing hotels and offices for construction this year. BCEG\\'s involvement in Airport City Manchester can be traced back to 2011 when the UK and China signed an infrastructure cooperation agreement. In 2013, when former prime minister David Cameron went to Beijing to promote the project, BCEG was invited to bid for it as a part of a consortium. \"We see Airport City Manchester as a first step into the UK market and an opportunity for us to gain experience and understand the UK\\'s construction market, so that we can take on bigger projects gradually and with more confidence,\" Yu says. He says experience can relate to construction methods, working with local contractors and suppliers, maintaining a good relationship with the British government, setting up local teams and developing a working relationship with local advisers. BCEG\\'s efforts won praise from Lynda Shillaw, CEO of MAG Property, the property arm of Manchester Airport Group. \"BGEG is a valuable partner in the development of Airport City and a positive example of the inward investment that is being attracted from China,\" she says. \"This is the first major infrastructure project in the UK with the involvement of a Chinese company as an equity partner, and it demonstrates how a new wave of investment from China is transforming infrastructure and development in the UK,\" Shillaw says. After building a reputation with the Airport City Manchester project, BCEG successfully started two new projects. The first was Middlewood Locks, a residential project that employed the Beijing-based company as a design and construction contractor. The second is St Michael\\'s, a residential and commercial property development that has two tall towers and is located in the heart of Manchester, near Town Hall. BCEG is investing a 21 percent stake in St Michael\\'s, and is in charge of design and construction. It will play a supporting role in sales by promoting the residential and office units in China.    Yu says BCEG\\'s key advantages in the UK market include its competitive edge as a highly international company, and its comprehensive supply chain. \"The UK construction market is very mature. It has a good legal framework and we can learn a lot of lessons here; but still, the amount of construction going on in the UK is nothing compared to China. \"In Manchester, for example, the only tall tower in the city is the Hilton Hotel. The rest of the buildings here are quite old, so perhaps compared with local construction companies we have a lot of experience.\" BCEG has worked on many recent big projects in China, like the new offices of the Beijing government, the headquarters of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the APEC conference center and the Beijing New Airport, among others. BCEG has offices in 27 countries so it has accumulated experience from different international markets. In addition, it has a comprehensive supply chain. \"We can supply our UK projects with cost-effective materials, which are either our own materials or materials from our existing suppliers in China,\" Yu says. He explains that many European construction firms would actually like to buy materials from China, but the fact that BCEG is a Chinese company and knows the Chinese market well means it can source the most cost-effective materials with the same quality. In addition, BCEG\\'s role as an investment partner in some projects where it is also the contracted builder means it is able to become involved in the project at an early stage. \"This means we can give the project owner advice on what is possible and efficient, so that their initial designs are made with construction practicality in mind. Then there will not be so many alterations at later stages,\" Yu says. Christopher Bovis, professor of European and international business law at the University of Hull, says the ability of Chinese firms like BCEG to act as both financial investors and construction contractors helps with their profitability. \"As a financial investor, they can be incentivized to improve the efficiency of the supply chain and create savings through volume, so the project will generate better returns.\" BCEG\\'s international expansion fits into the trend of Chinese infrastructure builders going global, supported by the Chinese government. Examples of such companies include Liaoning Fortone, a private construction business in Shenyang, currently constructing two 299-megawatt combined heat and power stations in Wales, and China Triumph International Engineering Co, which built six solar farms in the UK. Yu says BCEG\\'s internationalization strategy fits roughly into three phases, which apply to many Chinese construction companies in general. The first was in the 1970s, when China sent many construction workers to developing nations, such as parts of Africa, as a part of its financial aid. A lot of those first projects built according to Chinese standards and much of the construction was done by Chinese workers, he says. The second phase mainly happened in Southeast Asian countries, before the Asian Financial Crisis. The third phase happened after 2000. \"This third phase involved much of the expansion into developed markets, such as the UK,\" says Yu. During this process we have taken on a different model of expansion. In developed markets, where we cannot easily second many employees, we mostly rely on local partners and play the role of project managers, leveraging on our experiences and management skills.\" Looking into the future, Yu says his team is keen to expand across Europe, and especially in the UK. He believes construction opportunities in northwestern England will not be affected by Brexit-related uncertainties because the UK market is currently at a point where population growth is creating a large demand for property, and this demand is not being met by current market supply. \"Brexit means the UK needs to generate more growth from its own economy, and the Northern Powerhouse can supply a lot of this growth. The fact that many Chinese companies are interested in Northern Powerhouse-related investment opportunities means that we can play a role in leading these investments, and invest alongside other Chinese companies,\" says Yu. cecily.liu@mail.chinadailyuk.com (China Daily European Weekly 01/06/2017 page30)'],\n",

The plans set goals to increase the trading volume of e-commerce to 40 trillion yuan ($5.76 trillion; 5.49 trillion euros; 4.68 trillion) by 2020, including 10 trillion yuan from online retail businesses. The e-commerce market is expected to employ 50 million people by the end of 2020, according to the plan. The plans also set out five tasks to expand the e-commerce market, such as speeding the upgrading, promoting its deep integration of e-commerce with traditional industry, improving the public service system of e-commerce and optimizing its governance. JD.com Inc, China\\'s second-largest e-commerce player, says the plan is to improve the quality and promote the upgrading of e-commerce, which will play an important role in driving the transformation of the real economy, deepening supply-side reform and achieving the integration of the internet and the real economy. The company says cutting-edge technologies, including big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and intelligent hardware, will aid the development of e-commerce. And, e-commerce players will utilize new technologies extensively during the period of the plan. Chinese cross-border B2B e-trade company DHgate says: \"The plan is put forward to promote the deep integration of e-commerce with traditional industries. We have built bridges for small and medium-sized enterprises to enter overseas markets since 2004.\"    In the future, DHgate will help traditional enterprises transform and upgrade, as well as find new growth points for the country\\'s foreign trade.

CNPC, together with 28 other oil companies including Total SA, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and PJSC Gazprom, is among the international companies that have qualified to bid for tenders, according to Iran's oil ministry If CNPC wins, the deal would be in the interests of both countries, reviving Iran's energy industry which has been hard hit by international sanctions while satisfying China, the world's second-largest economy, which has a strong demand for energy. Iran is trying to fast-track projects to boost oil and gas production amid low prices and wants to sign agreements as soon as possible. However, Alastair Syme, an oil analyst at Citigroup Inc in London, warns companies to be wary of investing too quickly or too much in Iran. According to a senior engineer with CNPC, despite years of sanctions leading to a hammered economy and infrastructure, Iran, with the world's biggest natural gas reserves-estimated by BP Plc at 34 trillion cubic meters- still has significant strategic importance, with its substantial reserves of oil and gas.    Strategically located in the Middle East and sharing land borders with 15 nations, Iran also plays a crucial role in the Belt and Road Initiative as an energy hub, he says. According to CNPC, the company has been present in Iran since 2004 and is engaged in oil and gas operations and oilfield services. In 2009, the company signed contracts with National Iranian Oil Co to develop the North Azadegan Oilfield and Phase 11 of the South Pars gas field, which began trial production in 2015. Iran exported 500,000 to 600,000 barrels of crude oil per day to China in 2015, and the country recently signed a $4.8 billion (4.6 billion euros; 3.9 billion) natural gas development project with CNPC and Total. Iran aims to attract more than $100 billion in foreign investment to boost the country's energy sector. The country has doubled its exports as crude prices rallied. Iran boosted oil output in 2016 by 870,000 barrels per day to 3.67 million bpd by November, and has reached several preliminary agreements with international companies, despite no concrete deals having been signed yet, Bloomberg says. The country has set a target for daily output of 5.7 million bpd of crude and condensate early in the next decade, according to Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh. zhengxin@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/06/2017 page25)\"],\n",

Xu says China has around 6 million metric tons of electronic waste. Every year, the country generates 24 billion waste batteries.    \"The waste is an urban mine to be exploited and an environmental disaster at the same time,\" he says. Founded in 2001, the company, based in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, went public in 2010 on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. It now has net assets of 6.7 billion yuan ($963.5 million; 926.3 million euros; 787.2 million). In 2003, GEM proposed the idea of \"digging into the urban mines\" to recycle used batteries, electronic waste, scrap cars and rare metals such as nickel, tungsten and cobalt. Battery recycling is an important part of GEM\\'s business portfolio, which accounted for 25 percent of its total revenue of 3.3 billion yuan, up 45.7 percent from the same period last year, in the first half of this year. The profits from battery recycling totaled 36.6 percent of its net profit of 172 million yuan for the half, which was up 30 percent from last year. Lithium battery production is expanding thanks to the fast growth of the new-energy vehicle sector. The Lithium Institute of Shenzhen Gaogong Industry Research Co says that in the third quarter of 2016, national output of lithium battery materials was worth 11 billion yuan.    According to research by Li Junhua, chief researcher at the Shenzhen-based ylz360.com, a website for energy consulting, sales revenues from recycled metals from lithium batteries - including cobalt, nickel, manganese, iron and aluminum - will increase sharply to 5.2 billion yuan in 2018, 13.6 billion yuan in 2020, and more than 30 billion yuan by 2023. The new-energy vehicle plan projects that by 2020 the annual production capacity of the industry will be 2 million units, with sales to date at a cumulative 5 million units. Xu Shiguo, deputy director of GEM\\'s new-energy material research institute, says the company has formed a recycling network throughout China, with 12 waste recycling bases. Since 2005, GEM has treated 15,000 tons of cobalt, 10,000 tons of nickel and 4,000 tons of manganese in its effort to build an industrial chain of recycled raw materials. \"Our goal is to build a closed cycle in the industry from materials, batteries, new-energy car manufacturing, supply chain finance and power battery recycling,\" Xu says. yangziman@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/06/2017 page27)'],\n",

That is because buyer interest in office buildings, serviced apartments and commercial complexes is rising, according to a research report by DTZ/Cushman & Wakefield, a realty services provider. The report says the realty investment market in China has been \"particularly active\" in 2016 and may continue to thrive in 2017.   A potential buyer seeks information about property projects at a real estate expo in Shanghai. Yang Yi / For China Daily  Nationwide, bloc deals were worth some 200 billion yuan this year. In Shanghai alone, bloc deals exceeded 130 billion yuan, more than double that in 2015, according to DTZ. In terms of transaction value in Shanghai, office building deals accounted for more than 75 percent of all transactions. In terms of transacted space, they accounted for more than 70 percent. \"An obvious trend is that domestic buyers are dominating the market, and the average transaction value of deals is rising. Domestic buyers are favoring premier office buildings that bring stable and steady income. Investors are looking for quality assets, and the real estate market provides good opportunities,\" says Jim Yip, managing director of Investment and Advisory Services, China, DTZ/Cushman & Wakefield. As residential property policies have been tightened earlier this month, investors are looking at commercial realty. The easier interest rate environment has also encouraged buyers to look at bigger deals, analysts say. Insurer-linked funds, which have been widely reported to have acquired overseas assets in previous years, are also allocating huge amounts to domestic assets like office buildings, commercial complexes and shopping malls. Post transaction, buildings may be refurbished or transformed for other purposes, based on current trends. For example, old hotels in central locations are turned into office buildings, the DTZ report says. Office buildings in Wuhan, Shenzhen and Chengdu are in great demand as they play a key role in driving regional growth, the report says. Serviced apartments are also expected to become a key real estate category and an investor target in the next few years, particularly in first- and second-tier cities, given the rise in transaction value. For instance, Shanghai\\'s serviced apartments generated 7.15 billion yuan in 2016 sales, up from 4.2 billion yuan in 2015. wuyiyao@chinadaily.com.cn ( China Daily European Weekly 01/06/2017 page27)'],\n",

The previous high was 53.8 in July 2015. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while below 50 represents contraction. Demand in the sector picked up as new orders at service companies rose in December at the fastest pace in 17 months. Rising raw-materials costs for service companies caused expenses to soar at their fastest rate in nearly two years, but service providers only slightly raised their prices in December due to market competition. Optimism about growth in 2017 reached a four-month high, with surveyed companies generally showing more confidence due to improving market conditions and company expansions.    The Caixin China Manufacturing PMI, which was released on Jan 3, hit a 47-month high of 51.9 in December.

His wide range of interests reflects the extraordinary range of businesses of the $40 billion (38 billion euros; 32.4 billion) technology and manufacturing giant, from aerospace to electronic control technologies for buildings, homes and turbochargers, to high-performance materials. But Adamczyk, 50, who is to be the new CEO starting at the end of March, is pushing for even more changes in his group. He is determined to take the company to even higher heights of involvement in the digital age.   Darius Adamczyk, CEO-in-waiting of Honeywell, will take office in March. Provided to China Daily  On his recent trips to China, Adamczyk talked to his Chinese teams about how the multinational will achieve more growth by blending its strengths in hardware with a stronger presence in software in the digital age. He encouraged them to create new ideas as startups rather than in an established industrial conglomerate. He believes the place to achieve such breakthroughs is in China, Honeywell\\'s second-largest market after the United States. Adamczyk is clear about how committed Honeywell is to the country - with its major presence, 13,000 employees and diversified businesses in manufacturing and research and development, which serves both Chinese and international markets. Honeywell wants to be viewed as a local player, working at the brisk performance level that has been achieved by many domestic companies, he says. \"When I think about China, I can\\'t think of a company that\\'s more aligned to the needs of where the country is heading,\" he says, citing the key areas of energy conservation, energy solutions, clean air and water, smart buildings, chemicals and work safety. Recently he spoke with China Daily about the company\\'s strategy and business opportunities in China. The following are edited excerpts from the interview. Q: What are your strategies for the company in the long term? A: No 1 is to continue to provide superior value to our customers, and No 2 is to drive digitalization throughout Honeywell. We have a strong presence in software but we have a lot more opportunities to drive it. All aspects of our business are very customer-centric. I want to make sure that we operate in segments that are exciting and growing, and well-aligned with mega trends. How are you going to blend software programming with Honeywell\\'s existing physical products? Honeywell has been developing in internet of things, and we have access to data. Honeywell is the company that has those products that actually generate that data. However, we\\'ve used that information just to make the basically functional products. We now aim to integrate the data with information across the whole installation base that we have, and across all our products, and to think about our customers\\' challenges differently. We now have opportunities to redefine how we create new value for our customers through our software capability, installation base and domain knowledge. What do you think are the most challenging issues in making Honeywell more flexible and nimble in the internet era? Speed is something that\\'s going to separate the winners from losers. And in this new industrial software - and certainly one of the things that I\\'m trying to enable in Honeywell - it\\'s important for us to be able to operate and come up with ideas at a whole different rate of speed than ever before. What\\'s your definition of a breakthrough? I\\'m never satisfied with the current speed of growth. When we think of growth, I think about it as continuing to gain a share in our core markets, but also coming up with adjacent strategies that will enhance our overall growth. So I\\'m pushing and driving the organization to be more creative, to think about our offerings differently, to rethink what breakthrough growth means and to take the time to set metrics and expectations to make sure that happens. What kind of incentives are you going to offer to your employees to be creative and develop new products and new applications? I am encouraging all of our businesses to create new ideas and new organizational structures, to create new small businesses. I want them to operate like startups. So I want to remove a lot of bureaucracy and encourage our people and businesses to embrace higher-risk, higher-reward breakthrough initiatives to really drive growth. How do you prioritize your business portfolio to meet this goal? As a new CEO takes over, we can take a look at the markets we are in and the markets we are not in and optimize our operations and where we are today. I really want to align our businesses towards a lot of longer-term global macro trends. But, most important for Honeywell, we have to be in segments where you differentiate yourself by technology. Honeywell is a technology company. How have Honeywell\\'s Chinese operations performed in the past year, and what are their prospects? They continue to do very well. We\\'ve had another strong year in China and we are anticipating it to be even stronger in 2017. We have seen a recovery in some areas. One of the more challenging market sectors in China has been the oil and gas segment, due to what\\'s been happening there. But, overall, it was a very strong year in 2016 and we look forward to an even stronger 2017. You started your career as an engineer. What is your advice to people making the transition from engineering to management? It\\'s the most challenging thing to make that first transition from being an engineer. In my case, I happened to bridge my engineering career with an MBA, to go into the world of business. But my advice to engineers is to take an assignment outside core engineering. Because the broader understanding you have, the more effectively you can make that progress. You\\'ve been praised for succeeding in every business leadership role you have ever held. What\\'s your secret? It\\'s about having strategies, having a group of people to work with and having the tactics to make sure the strategy is being executed every day, every week, every month, every year. Everybody in the organization should be able to say how they are contributing to that strategy. Then it\\'s about putting the operational systems in place. And people are critical. What is the most important quality for a leader? As a leader, you have to put a lot of energy and a lot of passion into the business. You have to be the spark that moves the organization. That\\'s something that I am always trying to do. I think the job of leader is to always set the bar higher, to always challenge the organization. What are your hobbies and interests outside of work? I spend all my spare time with my family. To make sure that you stay really grounded, what\\'s truly important is your family. wangzhuoqiong@chinadaily.com.cn Bio: Darius Adamczyk Age: 50 Career: March 2017: CEO of Honeywell Current: President and chief operating officer of Honeywell Previous positions include: President and CEO of Honeywell Performance Materials and Technologies; president of Honeywell Process Solutions; president of Honeywell Scanning & Mobility Senior associate at Booz Allen Hamilton Electrical engineer at General Electric Education: MBA, Harvard University Master\\'s degree in computer engineering from Syracuse University Bachelor\\'s degree in electrical and computer engineering from Michigan State University ( China Daily European Weekly 01/06/2017 page31)'],\n",

Liang says he\\'s gotten used to the routine after more than six months. Nowadays, a growing number of Chinese can enjoy services like this, thanks to the development of the online-to-offline waste recycling industry.   - A woman scans and installs an application for the collection of waste in Shanghai. Recycling services using apps are popular in big cities such as Shanghai and Beijing. Yang Yi / For China Daily     New Living (Beijing) Information Technology Co is a startup at the heart of the sector, which was established two years ago. It has developed an application that provides a regular door-to-door recycling service for waste - including plastic bottles, cans, paper and old electronic appliances. Having won itself a solid customer base in the capital, New Living is striving to carve out a self-sustaining business model, according to Xia Fan, its CEO. \"As scrap prices are declining, the company\\'s innovative business model is showing advantages in dealing with the challenge,\" Xia says. Besides recycling, the app also provides e-commerce services, enabling its users to purchase fruit and vegetables online and to hire housekeeping or repair services. Such services are not uncommon on other O2O platforms. But Xia says his company\\'s increasingly mature logistics system gives it an advantage over competitors. \"When collecting the waste, the worker can also deliver what the clients ordered online. That\\'s how we reduce costs and improve logistics efficiency,\" Xia adds.    Xia says he believes such \"reverse logistics\" represent a sustainable business model and will add to the returns in the recycling business. To date, New Living has built up a recycling team of more than 300 workers who serve more than 200,000 families in 800 communities in Beijing. The amount of wastepaper New Living recycled in 2016 more than doubled to 6,500 metric tons from the same period the year before. In the same period, the number of plastic bottles and cans processed totaled 36 million, up 38.5 percent from a year earlier. In the past few years, many startups have begun to compete in the industry, especially after the government released a six-year plan on building up a recycling system for renewable resources starting in January 2015. According to statistics from the Ministry of Commerce, China\\'s top 10 categories of recycling renewable resources in 2015 were worth 514.9 billion yuan ($74 billion; 71.2 billion euros; 60.5 billion). Li Yinan, an analyst at China Co-Harmony Investment Fund Management Co, says companies need to establish a sound and sustainable strategy. \"A door-to-door waste recycling service is demanded by many individuals. That means tremendous market potential ahead,\" Li says. \"For household waste, however, the profit margin is relatively low. O2O startups in this sector need large-scale operations.\" Tian Yuanyuan contributed to this story. jingshuiyu@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/06/2017 page29)'],\n",

In spite of the urban spread of China\\'s population, the year-end tradition of preserving meat is still popular, with a variety of birds, cuts of beef, mutton, pork and fish strung up in backyards and on balconies to catch the winter wind and sun. Let\\'s start from the southern end of the country where Cantonese cured meats form elaborate displays at New Year\\'s markets. Sausages are made from hand-cut belly pork and marinated in salt, plenty of sugar and quality Chinese yellow wine, which gives the links their characteristic red tinge. This is also the time when fresh duck or goose livers are marinated in spices, sugar and wine and stuffed into intestines. These, unlike the meat sausages, are seasonal delicacies only available for a limited time. Another uniquely Cantonese cured product is a whole pig liver, hollowed out and stuffed with a piece of pork fat. Surprisingly, they are not hard to eat. The liver turns firm during the curing process, while the fat turns crisp and transparent. The Cantonese cook steams, then cuts these liver sausages into very thin slivers, serving them on slices of steamed arrowroot or yam. More familiar are whole ducks which are spatchcocked, spiced and salted. The intensely savory birds will be a highlight on the reunion table on Lunar New Year\\'s Eve. Surprisingly, chicken is cooked fresh and seldom cured in the southern regions. Duck thigh fillets are now more popular with the modern generation, as traditions change with the shrinking size of families. These deep maroon nuggets are easily cut up and even easier to steam and there are no bony bits to contend with.    Further north, in Yunnan and Sichuan, various cuts of meat are heavily seasoned and hung up to dry, ending up in stir-fries or simply steamed. Here, the meats are pickled with lots of chilli and Sichuan peppercorns. Local sausages are also very spicy, and they leach a bright red oil when they are fried, sending out a fragrance that is irresistible to the homesick Sichuan native. Near the central plains and the lake regions just to the south, soy sauce is a major curing ingredient and sauce-cured strips of meat are already hanging up to dry in many backyards. Poultry, such as duck, goose or chicken, is also steeped in sauce. In Ningbo, a favorite New Year\\'s delicacy is a sort of ham, with chopped pork stuffed into a pig\\'s stomach and then cured in brine. In Hubei, where there are plenty of lakes and ponds, preparation for spring must start with fishing for carp. Whole carp are salted and then hung up to dehydrate but a good cured carp stays soft and supple for the New Year\\'s meals. As we move farther north, the nomadic influences come into play and the main ingredients change to beef and mutton, and the style becomes more like jerky. Whole sheep are cured and beef is cut and dried in easy-to-transport strips. Beef jerky is still popular with horsemen driving flocks. These days, however, they have become favorite snacks for the keyboard generation, who buy them from online supermarkets that deliver to the door. Strips of cured meat or tiny cubes individually wrapped are all best-sellers. The Hunting Month may have slowly evolved into the curing month, but it is still part of a culinary tradition that is a prelude to the most important celebration of the entire lunar year. paulined@chinadaily.com.cn Making sausages the Cantonese way Prepare sausage casings These natural pig intestines are heavily salted to preserve them, and you need to soak them for a day or two to make them supple again. Once they are soft, you have to gently run water through them to make sure there are no leaks. I often \"sterilize\" them by pushing fat cloves of garlic down the entire length. Cutting the meat The best ratio of fat to lean is about 70 percent marbled meat to 30 percent fat, which must be hand-cut into the smallest dices. It is the fat that keeps the sausages moist. Marbled meat is softer, with fat lacing the leaner fibers. These cuts are normally on the upper shoulders and thighs. Hand-cutting the meat is important if you want to control the texture. You can mince the meat but it means a more mealy and dense sausage after curing. Once the meats are prepared, mix them up thoroughly so there are jewels of fat studded throughout.    The marinade Salt, sugar and Chinese five-spice powder are dissolved in a dark soy sauce and Chinese yellow wine mixture. You must be able to smell the fragrance of the wine, so a quality product must be chosen. I also add a couple spoonfuls of strong white liqueur to aid the preservation. You can use vodka as a substitute. Taste. If you\\'re happy with the balance of flavors, it\\'s time to add the meat. Mix it all really well and let it sit for an hour for the meat to absorb the marinade. Stuffing the sausages Open up the sausage casing and push it up the narrow end of a funnel. Hold on to the casing as you push the meat through the funnel. If you are a beginner, work on shorter, more manageable lengths. Always check that your sausages are not split or leaking. Twist them into the lengths you want and then hang them on a bamboo pole. You can cure them on the balcony where the cold will soon dry them up. Remember to place a tray beneath the links to catch the dripping fat, otherwise your neighborhood pets will soon be congregating on your balcony or in your backyard. The links will be wrinkled and ready in about three weeks and you can then transfer them to the refrigerator. Steam them, or cut them up to fry. (China Daily European Weekly 01/06/2017 page18)'],\n",
       " ['Hit and myth: the movie monsters lost in translation nan Beasts portrayed in movies may be scary - but audiences complain they\\'re not really Chinese After watching Zhang Yimou\\'s latest film The Great Wall , Gu Meng was impressed by the army of Tao Tie monsters from Chinese mythology. However, he complained that the Tao Tie in Zhang\\'s film were not \"Chinese\" monsters. \"They look like Western ones with Chinese names. They have more in common with monsters from Hollywood films, such as Godzilla,\" says Gu, a programmer in Beijing who loves monster movies. Gu is not the only one to feel this way. Many Chinese netizens say that as the Tao Tie is seen as one of the four evil creatures - and is believed to be the offspring of a dragon, according Chinese mythology - it should have been portrayed as a single beast, instead of hoards of ant-like beasts in the film.   - Monsters are typically Westernized, like the one portrayed in the 2015 Chinese fantasy film Chronicles of the Ghostly Tribe. Photos Provided to China Daily   - A dragon designed by Gino Acevedo with wings and a body inspired by sea horses.   But the complaints are not only about Tao Tie. Chinese people have long complained that monsters portrayed in domestic movies look like those in Western films. That\\'s not surprising, since many were created by Western companies. The Tao Tie in Zhang\\'s film, which is based on the Chinese literary work Classic of Mountains and Seas, has been created by the New Zealand company Weta Workshop. Gao Xia, a concept designer with Weta Workshop, who worked on rendering Tao Tie, says: \"Chinese monsters are very different from their Western counterparts. It is also more difficult to portray Chinese monsters on screen because of the cultural factor.\" Pointing out some of the challenges involved in creating Chinese monsters, he says that, for example, the eyes of Tao Tie must be under the arms according to mythology. However, in the film they are moved to the neck. Referring to Hollywood creatures, he says: \"They must be anatomically perfect. The veins of the monster, the color of its skin, the muscles and even the parasites in them must make sense.\" Another problem with creating Chinese versions, he says, is that ancient paintings that portray Chinese monsters often use clouds and fire, and many monsters from folk tales and mythology only exist in the written form, making them difficult to portray. \"Just like Chinese ink paintings, we put more stress on imagination,\" says Gao. Speaking about the difference between monsters from the East and West, Gino Acevedo, who has been involved in the creation of monsters for films like The Lord of The Rings, The Hobbit and Alien, says Eastern culture is fond of the powers of supernatural beings, while the West turns to nature for inspiration. Acevedo himself is a good example of a monster expert inspired by nature. His favorite TV shows were all about animals. He loves lizards and snakes so much that he once raised more than 30 kinds of snakes and lizards in his bedroom. The dragons he now designs are based on these reptiles. His monsters often have sharp teeth or long tusks, which he says are inspired by crocodiles. \"I think ghosts and monsters from the East are more scary. They are supernatural. And, sometimes, even though they do not have eyes, they still know where you are.\" When it comes to the creatures that he finds memorable, he says that the ghosts and monsters from A Chinese Ghost Story, produced by Hong Kong director Tsui Hark, impressed many Westerners. The film is about a love story between a young man and a female ghost. Referring to the size of the monsters, Acevedo says that those in the East have the same proportions as human beings, but monsters in Western films typically have bigger bodies to show that they are not humans. Acevedo says that, although the West has a long history creating monsters on screen, China can find ideas from its own rich mythology. Gao says that after working with Western companies he feels it is now time for him and his Chinese peers in the film industry to look more closely at Chinese culture. He says this is because if you want to create a monster to meet local tastes you need cultural context. This view is supported by Yan Dingxian, 80, creator of the Monkey King and monsters in the animated film Havoc in Heaven, which was made in the 1960s. He says that it is a deep understanding of Chinese cultural elements like Peking Opera, mythologies and martial arts that made the movie popular with Chinese audiences at the time. dengzhangyu@chinadaily.com.cn   - A fish-like monster from the folk tale Madam White Snake created by Chinese artist Wu Jian\\'an.

       " ['Two-child policy poses risks for older women nan Experts are warning that the country\\'s new family planning measures could have unintended but far-reaching consequences In recent years, the treatment of pregnant patients has become an increasingly thorny task for Liu Wenxian, a cardiologist at Anzhen Hospital in Beijing, as a result of the rise in the number of older women wanting to give birth. \"Many of these women are from outside Beijing and have risky complications, such as cardiac disease,\" she says. \"The problem has worsened since the adoption of the universal two-child policy because such complications are more commonly seen in pregnant women who have given birth before. In many cases - especially when the patient\\'s condition is critical - we have to re-evaluate their decision to have a baby and end the pregnancy promptly to save their life.\"   - Mothers-to-be practice yoga at a training institute in Nanchang, Jiangxi province. Photos by Xinhua   - Pregnant women line up for health checks at Jinan Maternity and Child Care Hospital in Jinan, Shandong province, in March. Thirty percent of mothers-to-be visiting the hospital are expecting their second child, according to hospital sources.   Gu Hong, a pediatrician at the hospital who specializes in treating cardiac disease in babies, warns that the two-child policy could have unintended but far-reaching consequences: \"We are facing some very harsh challenges. Many women are trying their best to have a second child, even if conditions such as cardiac disease could put them at high risk.\" According to Gu, seven pregnant women have died in the hospital in the past five years as a result of cardiac complications, and those risks still exist despite improvements in medical technology. Anzhen Hospital is not alone in facing the challenge. According to the National Health and Family Planning Commission, in the first half of the year China\\'s maternity mortality rate reached 183 per 1 million people, an increase of more than 30 percent compared with the same period last year. The mortality rate had been declining steadily in China until the end of last year, when the country\\'s leaders approved the adoption of the universal two-child policy to tackle the problems posed by the nation\\'s rapidly aging population. As a result, the decadeslong family planning policy, which limited most couples to one child, was relaxed. Last year, the mortality rate during pregnancy fell to 201 per 1 million people, from 300 per 1 million in 2010, according to the commission. But the figure is now rising. \"The rise in the number of pregnant women, particularly those at higher risk, such as older women, resulted in a rise in maternity deaths in some parts of the country in the first half of the year,\" a statement released by the commission in October said. The NHFPC estimates that more than 3 million women at higher risk will become pregnant in China every year between the start of next year and 2020, a rise of 30 percent from the period before the adoption of the two-child policy. \"This will cause increased risks of maternity complications and present challenges to treatment and recovery,\" the commission said. The number of babies born in the first half of the year was 8.31 million, a rise of 6.9 percent over the same period last year, a significant increase despite the declining number of married women of fertile age, it said. In addition, the sudden rise in pregnancies has resulted in maternity services coming under greater strain, and both facilities and hospital personnel are under-resourced, according to the commission. Of the 90 million women now eligible to have a second baby, 60 percent are 35 or older, which means they are considered to be at higher risk during pregnancy, the NHFPC says. Gu says about 150 pregnant patients with cardiac complications were received by Anzhen Hospital last year, compared with approximately 110 in 2011. This year, the number is expected to surpass 180. Acting on traditional beliefs, many women are opting to have another child, according to Gu: \"Many of these patients are seeking treatment and care in our hospital, but not all women are suitable for pregnancy. Women with serious conditions are very likely to give birth to an unhealthy child, and their own lives could also be threatened during childbirth.\"    Liu, the cardiologist, urged older women to assess the risks they face before deciding to have a child. \"With the rise in age, pregnant women have a higher chance of developing illnesses. They must be aware of their physical condition before pregnancy to reduce the risk to them during childbirth,\" she says. He Wenjie, a gynecologist at the reproductive medicine department at Xuzhou Maternal and Child Healthcare Hospital, in Xuzhou, Jiangsu province, has also seen a rise in the number of older patients: \"The average age of patients I am receiving is rising. It is crucial that all women, especially those who are older, have checkups before pregnancy to reduce the health risk.\" The NHFPC says health authorities will take more measures in the next few years to improve the health of pregnant women, given the rising rates of mortality during pregnancy. Hospitals nationwide will add 89,000 obstetrics beds, and local authorities will upgrade emergency equipment at hospital obstetrics and pediatrics departments. The commission will also select a number of national midwifery training bases and organize training related to the treatment of pregnant women with critical conditions. It will also cooperate with other departments to provide training, with the aim of producing 140,000 extra obstetricians and midwives. wangxiaodong@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/06/2017 page20)'],\n",
       " ['You know where you are with province names nan Titles of Chinese regions are mostly based on logic and geography If there is one quality a good administrator of an empire ought to have it\\'s knowing where everything is. In early history, the tribes that were the forerunners of the Chinese civilization called their homeland \"the Central Plains\" - defined as the plains in the \"center\" of the various tribes that surrounded them. This name later gave rise to the term zhÅ\\x8dnggu¨®, or \"Central Kingdom\", the literal translation of the name of said civilization. The names of many Chinese administrative regions today retain helpful references to directions and geographic features to let you know roughly where they are, for instance, \"south of the river,\" or \"north of the river\".    Easy: Henan (æ²³å\\x8d\\x97, H¨¦n¨¢n), Hebei (æ²³å\\x8c\\x97, H¨¦bÄ\\x9bi), Hunan (æ¹\\x96å\\x8d\\x97ï¼\\x8cHÃºn¨¢n), Hubei (æ¹\\x96å\\x8c\\x97ï¼\\x8cHÃºbÄ\\x9bi), Shandong (å±±ä¸\\x9c, ShÄ\\x81ndÅ\\x8dng), Shanxi (å±±è¥¿, shÄ\\x81nxÄ«) First, brush up on your cardinal directions: ä¸?dÅ\\x8dng, east), è¥?(xÄ«, west), å\\x8d?(n¨¢n, south), å\\x8c?(bÄ\\x9bi, north). æ²?(h¨¦) refers to \"river\", æ¹?(hÃº) is \"lake\", and å±?(shÄ\\x81n) is \"mountain(s)\". But actually, in ancient times, æ²?was the exclusive name of the Yellow River, the major river of consequence in northern China, whereas your run-of-the-mill tributaries, streams, channels, conduits and waterways would have all been referred to as å·?(chuÄ\\x81n, as in Sichuan, \"four rivers\"). That more or less gives away the answer to the first pair of provinces: Henan and Hebei are regions (and later provinces) north and south of the Yellow River. Hunan and Hubei are likewise north and south of the lake, which in this case is Dongting Lake. The mountains referred to in Shandong and Shanxi, on the other hand, are open to some dispute. They could refer to the Taihang Mountains, which are located between Shanxi and Hebei province (but not present-day Shandong), Xiao Mountain in present-day Henan province, or Mount Hua in Shanxi. It could also refer to all of these mountains, as up until the Qing dynasty \"Shandong\" referred to a much larger region roughly comprising the plains around the eastern section of the Yellow River, east of the \"mountains,\" generally speaking, that were found north of the Central Plains. Moderate: Guangxi (å¹¿è¥¿, GuÇ\\x8engxÄ«), Guangdong (å¹¿ä¸\\x9c, GuÇ\\x8engdÅ\\x8dng), Jiangxi (æ±\\x9fè¥¿, JiÄ\\x81ngxÄ«) These province names also include cardinal directions, but no clear geographic marker. The å¹?(guÇ\\x8eng) in Guangxi Autonomous Region and Guangdong province literally means \"wide\", but the name of the region traces itself to Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty in the 2nd century BC. During his reign, the Han conquered the southern kingdom of Nanyue (å\\x8d\\x97è¶\\x8a, also known as Southern Yue), focused around the present-day city of Guangzhou. According to ancient historians, at this time Emperor Wu said: \"å\\x88\\x9då¼\\x80ç²¤å\\x9c°å®\\x9cå¹¿å¸\\x83æ\\x81©ä¿?(as we develop the Yue region, we must widely broadcast favor and trust).\" The characters å¹?and ä¿?quote gave rise to the name to the new regional capital Guangxin, and the entire region of present-day Guangdong and Guangxi came to be called \"Guangzhou\" after this city. In the Song Dynasty (960-1279), the road leading to this region had two branches called \"Guangxi South Road\" and \"Guangdong South Road,\" which gave the two present-day administrative regions their names. Jiangxi also has many confusing explanations. In ancient times the character æ±?(jiÄ\\x81ng), for river, belonged like æ²?exclusively to one river, which in this case is the Yangtze River (é\\x95¿æ±\\x9f, ch¨¢ngjiÄ\\x81ng). Since the Yangtze actually flows through present-day Jiangxi province, it would make sense that Jiangxi refers to the western part of the Yangtze, except Jiangxi is actually located quite far east. Some other explanations are that the æ±?actually refers to the èµ?(gÃ\\xa0n) River, another major river in the province. The real answer is that Jiangxi is an abbreviation: for æ±\\x9få\\x8d\\x97è¥¿é\\x83¨ (jiÄ\\x81ngn¨¢n xÄ«bÃ¹), or \"western part of the Jiangnan region\", the name given to the geographic and cultural area immediately south of the Yangtze. Hard: Shaanxi (é\\x99\\x95è¥¿, ShÇ\\x8enxÄ«), Yunnan (äº\\x91å\\x8d\\x97, YÃºnn¨¢n), Hainan (æµ·å\\x8d\\x97, HÇ\\x8ein¨¢n), Tibet (è¥¿è\\x97\\x8fï¼\\x8cXÄ«zÃ\\xa0ng) Like Jiangxi, the names of these provinces and regions also lack a direct counterpart. However, unlike Jiangxi, the reason here is that these names all refer to former Chinese border regions and are named according to their cardinal direction relative to some description of China\\'s borders, highlighting their status \"outside\" the ancient definition of the homeland; their \"counterpart\" would simply be existing Chinese regions that already had names or more broadly, China itself. Shaanxi, currently home to Xi\\'an, the former imperial capital of Chang\\'an, was integrated into the central Chinese civilization early on. However, the name of the region comes from its location west of the Shaan Plateau (é\\x99\\x95å¡¬, shÇ\\x8enyu¨¢n) in present-day Shaan county, Henan province, and was decidedly a frontier region of the Western Zhou Dynasty (c.11th century-771 BC), which was based around the Central Plains. In around the 9th century BC, the region became the seat of the Qin Kingdom, one of the Warring States, which was considered by the other states to be a western border-region upstart beneath their notice. As we now know, the Qin exploited this advantage and conquered all the other states to become the Qin Empire, the first Chinese empire, and with this the former frontier of Shaanxi and the Qin capital of Chang\\'an became the new Chinese heartland. The names of Yunnan and Hainan both connote places that, in ancient times, were really, incredibly, unimaginably far away. Yunnan literally means \"South of the Clouds\", and that is the actual origin of the name: it was the mysterious region south of the cloud-shrouded mountains that marked the southwestern boundary of the ancient Chinese civilization, but a more colorful legend states that one day, Emperor Wu of Han saw iridescent clouds on top of a mountain and ordered his servant to follow it. When the servant reported back that he found land south of those clouds, Emperor Wu named it \"Yunnan\". Hainan, on the other hand, comes from Hainan Island and the name means \"South of the Sea\", and was among many folk names that the island used to go by in ancient times including \"southern extremity\" (å\\x8d\\x97æ\\x9e\\x81, n¨¢nj¨ª), \"edge of the sea\" (æµ·è§\\x92, hÇ\\x8eijiÇ\\x8eo), and \"edge of the sky\" (å¤©æ¶¯, tiÄ\\x81ny¨¢). \"Xizang\", finally, has several explanations: the character è\\x97?(zÃ\\xa0ng) itself is said to be a transliteration of a Tibetan word for the region populated by the Tibetan ethnic group, which also included present-day parts of Sichuan and Qinghai provinces. \"Xi\", however, comes from a slightly different origin, as part of the general name that Chinese empires since the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) gave to their western border regions (è¥¿å\\x9f\\x9f, xÄ«yÃ¹). Expert level: Guandong (å\\x85³ä¸\\x9c, GuÄ\\x81ndÅ\\x8dng); all provincial abbreviations Guandong, not to be confused with Guangdong, was the old name for the northeastern region of China, which in English today is still called \"Manchuria\" (a name first created by French missionaries). The name referred to the region\\'s position east (but mostly north) of the passes on the Great Wall, through which the Manchu rulers of the Qing Dynasty (1636-1912) eventually entered China and integrated the region into the Chinese homeland.

       " ['Building a giant reputation nan An architect ahead of his time, self-described rebel Wang Shu struggled for years with no commissions before going on to win the coveted Pritzker Prize When officials of Fuyang approached Wang Shu in 2012 to ask him to design an arts center, the Pritzker Prize-winning architect had a rather unusual condition. He wanted to have a hand in designing homes for local villages as well. Fuyang is located about an hour\\'s drive from Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, and sits on the north bank of the Fuchun River, a place renowned for its natural beauty. Earlier this year, it became a district under the city of Hangzhou.   - A view of the roof of the Gongwang Art Museum. The building is part of an arts complex that houses an archive and another museum.   - The architecture of the Gongwang Art Museum blends traditional Chinese elements with modern aesthetics. Photos Provided to China Daily   The local administration promptly agreed to Wang\\'s request. The prospect of securing the services of this famous figure in the architecture world was reason enough to do so. In a display of just how much they revered Wang, the local authorities dedicated a prime piece of land near a mountain and by a river for the arts center. Should that piece of land in this location be used for real estate development today, it would be valued at a staggering 1 billion yuan ($150 million; 142.6 billion euros; 5121.5 billion). Such was Wang\\'s influence. The arts center will comprise three buildings - Gongwang Art Museum, Fuyang Archives and Fuyang Museum - all of which will be designed by Wang. The Gongwang Art Museum is already open to public, while the other two segments are still under construction. Wang, 53, is the first Chinese person to win the world\\'s top prize in architecture. Based in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, he is currently dean of the School of Architecture at the China Academy of Art. A lover of traditional art, Wang grew up in the Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region, where his mother worked as a schoolteacher. During the \"cultural revolution\" (1966-76), when schools across the country were shuttered, teachers and many others were forced to become farmers. As a young boy, Wang enjoyed working in the fields as it enabled him to feel a connection with the earth. He said that he also found fulfillment in physical labor. Wang loved reading and had fortuitous access to a range of books censored by the government when his mother was transferred from the fields to become a librarian. When he was 10, Wang moved to Xi\\'an, Shaanxi province, where tents were used as classrooms. He later witnessed how the locals would build new classrooms and was fascinated with the bamboo frameworks used in the construction process. As Wang was passionate about art and engineering, he decided to study architecture at Southeast University because he thought the discipline was a perfect blend of the two. He describes himself as a rebellious undergraduate who was always ready to challenge professors. Wang even wrote a thesis criticizing modern Chinese architecture. A keen lover of traditional Chinese art, with a particular interest in ancient gardens and landscape paintings, Wang was eager to incorporate the aesthetics and building techniques of such places into his own creations. But he was perhaps too far ahead of his time, because no one on China\\'s architectural scene acknowledged or understood his ideas. For several years following his graduation, Wang had no commissions to work on. He said it was his wife, Lu Wenyu, who smoothed the rough edges of his personality. In 1997, the two of them founded the Amateur Architecture Studio. In his new book How To Build House, Wang pays tribute to his wife, conceding that \"for the first seven years of our married life, it was her who supported me\". The couple lived an idyllic life in Hangzhou where they would often stroll along West Lake and had plenty of time to spend sipping tea with friends. Wang says this calming experience nurtured his heart and in turn evoked a change in his perspective on life. \"You could spend a long time watching the rain, how it falls along the ridges of a building, how the streams flow and where the water drops. All this interests you. You would be thinking if it is possible to design architecture and show clearly where the rain comes from, where it flows, where it goes ... each turn and change in movement touches one\\'s heart,\" he says. Wang\\'s unique style was eventually recognized and he was presented with the opportunity to design the Ningbo Museum in Zhejiang province. Construction of the museum, which featured the use of bricks salvaged from old buildings that were demolished to make way for modern developments, took place between 2004 and 2008. Wang said he approached the structure as if creating a landscape painting.    \"Looking at the museum from afar, you see the building as a painting of a mountain that is spreading out right in front of your eyes. When entering the structure, you\\'ll find different landscapes at different positions, offering different perspectives. This is how traditional Chinese landscape paintings should be experienced, through free shifts of perspective and angles,\" Wang says. After this project, Wang was a part of the World Expo 2010 in Shanghai, for which he designed the Tengtou Village Pavilion, inspired by a painting of a mountain dwelling by Chen Hongshou (1599-1652). He says that stepping into the doorway of the pavilion is akin to entering a cave where different landscapes unfold at every step, like \"a page in an ancient leaflet of small paintings\". Wang also gained international recognition for designing a building on the Xiangshan Campus of the China Art Academy in suburban Hangzhou. In 2012, Wang received the accolade that most people in his profession can only dream of. He won the Pritzker Architecture Prize. The Pritzker jury praised his \"unique ability to evoke the past, without making direct references to history\", while calling his work \"timeless, deeply rooted in its context and yet universal\". Wang describes his approach as a combination of ancient aesthetics with modern utility. As an architect working in contemporary China, he believes that \"one has the opportunity to create something great, something lasting longer than his own life span.\" For the Fuyang project, Wang was determined to reignite the ancient Chinese admiration for mountains and rivers which embodies a unique Chinese philosophy about seeking a life that is in harmony with nature. This was why he specified his unusual condition about designing homes for local villagers. Together with employees from Amateur Architecture Studio and students from the China Art Academy, Wang visited 290 villages in the area to inspect old houses and become immersed in the traditional way of life. He says that nature plays an integral role in the simple yet charming way of life in such areas which is today on the verge of extinction. He laments how many of the homes being built in the country today are soulless \"American-style big villas\" or \"fake antiques\" with white walls and gray tiles. Wang used the smaller residential structures in the village as a canvas for experimentating with ideas. He used stones, old tiles and materials usually considered worthless to construct new village homes and this process helped him determine what he would do for the design of the Gongwang Art Museum. While the museum might be large, its imposing size is tempered by the roof\\'s long and soft curves which are reminiscent of the mountain ridges in the distance. But not everyone is in awe of Wang\\'s creations. Some have raised concerns about leakage issues, high maintenance and how his buildings are too distinctive in style, drawing attention away from the exhibits on display. However, Li Lei, director of China Art Museum Shanghai, begs to differ, saying that a fine piece of architecture of the kind Wang has created is \"a bold challenge to pragmatism\". \"The building itself is a piece of art. ... Apart from the skyscrapers that are mushrooming all over China, the country needs architecture for aesthetic appreciation and spiritual fulfillment, too,\" says Li. \"As the nation\\'s ideas develop in tandem with economic growth, there will be cultural awakening, and people will soon be able to appreciate great architecture.\" zhangkun@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/06/2017 page21)'],\n",

So far, the tourism potential of the area has lured a few young locals who worked in big cities to return home. Fang Chaoxi, in his 20s, is one of the younger generation who quit his white-collar job in Hangzhou and returned to set up an inn in the mountainous Pinghu village, which is just five minutes from the Qiandao Lake zone, in 2013. \"I decided that it was better for me to be my own boss,\" says Fang. His instincts have been proved right, and business is brisk. Now his business brings in roughly 600,000 yuan ($86,335; 69,944) a year. His guests come mostly from Jiangsu, Shanghai and Zhejiang. \"Most of my guests stay for around four days and just lie back and enjoy themselves,\" says Fang. Now, the village has roughly 40 inns developed by locals which can accommodate more than 700 visitors at a time. Local inn owners mostly promote their business online and the local offerings are very popular with the visitors. \"They enjoy the local cuisine, the fishing and fruit picking,\" says Fang. The village\\'s white loquats are a specialty and the annual output could be worth as much as 13.6 million yuan, according to local authorities. Other young people have also returned since Fang came back. \"I was the first who returned, but now there are enough of us to play mahjong,\" says Fang. Meanwhile, driving through the county, we find well-paved roads lined with colorful plants as the local government has spent 1.6 billion yuan to develop green belts across Chun\\'an. Those belts extend to all villages in the region, with tea and fruit parks all over. All those belts run 350 kilometers through the county, making it easier for cycling, hiking and public transportation. \"They are lined with green plants,\" says Jiang. Improved infrastructure has also helped boost the development of the surrounding villages that used to be cut off. Feng Bo, who gave up his chemical business in Hangzhou\\'s Xiaoshan district, and moved to Taoyuanlingjia village to start a fruit plantation three years ago, says: \"It used to take a whole day for us to travel to downtown Chun\\'an earlier. But now the distance has been shortened to just 40-minute drive.\" Feng\\'s plantation produces 50 fruits, including peaches and kiwis. \"Visitors can pick seasonal fruits throughout the year,\" he says. More than 10,000 visitors have been to his facility so far this year and the income from fruit picking has topped one million yuan. Feng also offers dining and barbecue facilities, and wooden villas are available for those who want to spend the night. Feng is now planning to build an open-air exercise facility. His business has also created job opportunities for locals. Among the things that makes him happy are his good relationship with the locals and the changes he has been able to bring about in the local environment. \"Everything was dirty and chaotic when I first came here, but now every household cleans up their own mess and keeps things in order,\" he says. A sewage system was also set up to treat waste water in the area, thanks to support from the government, he adds. Taoyuanlingjia is just one example of the transformation taking place in Chun\\'an. Jiang says that so far, the local government has spent approximately 2 billion yuan to develop a sewage system and roads in the area, and modern toilets have been built across the county. \"So, all sewage is treated to ensure clean water and soil,\" he says. Animal waste is also being taken care of. Locals have benefited from improving tourism and have thus began to protect the greenery. \"Preserving water resources matters for Zhejiang, and a tourism-led development model is the ideal way out,\" he adds. yangfeiyue@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 01/06/2017 page22)'],\n",

But what really helped the 18-year-old get into the elite US university was something more rare: her potential to be an international golf star. \"Emily is the epitome of a student-athlete,\" said Stanford golf head coach Anne Walker. \"She has pursued an extremely rigorous academic schedule in Beijing and, at the same time, traveled internationally to compete in the best golf events.\" Many Chinese families with children who play golf were also overjoyed at Stanford\\'s decision, but for a more practical reason. For them, a golf scholarship from such a prestigious US university is another testimonial affirming a unique strategy of college preparation that centers on the game as a scholarship vehicle.   - Pupils attend a gold training class at a golf school in Shanghai. The school, established in 2015, specializes in golf training for adolescents. Gao Erqiang / China Daily  In the past few years, dozens of Chinese students have played golf on US sports scholarships that were won after years of hard training and with considerable parental investment of money and time. The trend has accelerated since 2015 and there is now a bigger crop ripe for the picking, with almost 20 students from the Chinese mainland signing with golf programs at universities including Stanford, Princeton, the University of Southern California, the University of Washington and the University of California, Berkeley, according to the American Junior Golf Association, which tracks students\\' commitments to college offers. While Wang is the youngest ever to win the China LPGA Tour, several others have the same, if not more illustrious, golf resumes, despite their youthfulness. They include University of Florida freshman Andy Zhang who, at the age of 14, was the youngest golfer ever to compete in the US Open. He Muni, who was born in Chengdu, known for amateur appearances at pro events and top junior finishes. She will compete on the USC women\\'s team in the spring. Most of the teens learned the game at a young age, with their fathers as their first teacher. All have come from upper-middle-class families, since training and competition are expensive. Wang\\'s mother, Liu Yan, who advocates golf as a steppingstone to US universities, says she had devoted all her time to her daughter as her cook, driver and chaperon. Her father trained with her during weekends and took leave to be her caddie at important competitions. However, Liu says she believes that extraordinary self-discipline was the key to her daughter\\'s success. Likewise, Dan Webb, CEO of Palm Springs Golf, an academy for local children in southern Shenzhen, says he believes young Chinese golfers\\' greatest advantage is their way of thinking. \"The Chinese philosophy produces an extreme work ethic, focus and humility,\" he says. \"When circumstance allows self-confidence to be introduced within this philosophy, you have the making of a serious golf player, perhaps a champion.\" Luo Ying caused a stir in Seattle in 2013 when she played for the University of Washington while maintaining a 4.0 grade point average.

In the past few years, China\\'s railway network, especially high-speed lines, has undergone dramatic change. He Junyi / For China Daily  Over the past few years, China\\'s railway network, especially high-speed rail, has undergone dramatic change. From 2011 to 2015, China invested 3.58 trillion yuan to build 30,000 km of railway. By the end of this year, the nation\\'s total railway length will reach 124,000 km, including 20,000 km of high-speed railway, accounting for 65 percent of the world\\'s total high-speed rail. In July, the National Development and Reform Commission issued an updated national railway development plan envisioning a 175,000-km rail network by the end of 2025, with 38,000 km of high-speed rail. However, the network still faces challenges, especially in the less-developed western part of China. Yang says he is confident that lines in western China will eventually become profitable. \"Plus, building high-speed railways in less-developed regions is not only about recouping investment. It is part of the big project of rejuvenating the whole region and the country\\'s economy. The high-speed rail linking Beijing and Shanghai showed a profit last year, Xinhua News Agency reported in July, quoting Tianjin Railway Construction Co, a shareholder of Beijing-Shanghai High-Speed Railway Co. Yang Hao, a professor of rail transportation at Beijing Jiaotong University, says the economic returns of a high-speed railway network shouldn\\'t be judged solely on whether lines are profitable, since these railways can leverage the development of such industries as tourism, logistics and real estate. According to China Railway Corp, construction began on Dec 29 on a high-speed line linking Guiyang, Guizhou province - a transportation hub connecting members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -and Nanning, capital of the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region. The 482-km line will connect the Shanghai-Kunming railway and the Chengdu-Guiyang railway to the north, and will also link to southern coastal areas including Hainan province and Guangzhou, Guangdong province.

In recent years the Chinese government has made great efforts to improve food safety. But while it has been constantly improving, many problems remain, Xi said. He urged authorities at all levels to adhere to \"the strictest standards\" for \"the strictest supervision\" of food safety, and the imposition of punishments of greater severity for those guilty of endangering it. China will also build a professional team of food safety inspectors and improve law enforcement capacity at the grassroots level to improve safety at every link, he said. Premier Li Keqiang also urged local governments to give priority to ensuring the safety of the food chain and improving supervision mechanisms. Improving safety should start at the source, and irregularities must be severely punished, he said. Zhang Gaoli, vice-premier and head of the Food Safety Commission of the State Council, China\\'s Cabinet, said China\\'s food safety situation is stable in general but at the same time challenging and complex. Zhang spoke while hosting a commission meeting on Jan 3. He urged authorities across China to adopt strict measures to fight irregularities, including improving legislation, such as considering criminal punishments in cases of food adulteration and fake food products. Zhang also urged authorities to release the 13th Five-Year Plan for Food Safety (2016-20) and increase investment in safety supervision and law enforcement. The integrity of food production systems has been a major concern for the Chinese people, especially after a severe case of melamine adulteration in 2008, in which thousands of infants across China were sickened and four died after ingesting melamine-tainted infant formula made by Sanlu Group, a leading domestic dairy operator. Melamine, a chemical used in plastics, was used to make it appear that the products contained high protein. Food safety ranked at the top of a list of 10 safety issues that most worry Chinese, according to a survey released by Xiaokang magazine and Tsinghua University in July. In January, the China Food and Drug Administration published a list of 35 catering companies that used opium, banned as a food additive, in their dishes. The list included some famous chain restaurants. China has seen improvements since it adopted its revised Food Safety Law in 2015. Tests showed that 96.8 percent of samples met standards in 2015, an increase of 2.1 percentage points compared with the previous year, according to a report by law enforcement teams dispatched by the National People\\'s Congress, China\\'s top legislature. The report was based on inspections in 10 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions. The report also noted that food safety in China still faces major challenges, including lack of law enforcement capacity at the grassroots level caused by lack of equipment and talent.

The State Council\\'s executive meeting on Dec 28, chaired by Premier Li Keqiang, approved a new guideline to further attract foreign investment and advance China\\'s opening-up. \"We should take measures with great effectiveness in attracting foreign capital,\" Li said. Under the new guideline, foreign investment access hurdles will be dropped in a number of manufacturing sectors, including rail transportation, motorbikes and ethanol fuels. Foreign capital will have access to fields like energy, water conservancy, environmental protection and utilities via franchise agreements. \"China\\'s economy develops as we continue our opening-up strategy. Besides advanced technology and experience in management, China also needs capital investment from overseas,\" Li said.    The catalog for industrial access for foreign investors also will be amended to match the new measures. Foreign capital will be encouraged to enter high-end manufacturing, as well as related services, such as industrial design and logistics. Accounting and auditing, architecture design and rating services will be open to foreign investment for the first time. Foreign-funded companies will be cleared to join the national science and technology program as equals with domestic ones, and enjoy favorable policies under the \"Made in China 2025\" strategy. The guideline emphasizes equal treatment for foreign investors, and no additional restrictions are allowed. Li said that government at all levels should further streamline administration to reinforce the implementation of existing policies in attracting foreign investment and to reduce institutional costs. The new guideline highlights consistency in policies designed to attract foreign investment. Better protection of intellectual property rights for investors is also covered. The government will work to make it easier for foreign investors and experts to live and work in China. Foreign investment in the \"encouraged categories\" in central and western areas will receive financing, land and taxation incentives. Li has emphasized the importance of foreign investment this year. Addressing the UN General Assembly in New York in September, he vowed that China will carry out a new round of opening-up. Foreign investment is vital for China\\'s economic transformation and structural adjustment, according to Chen Fengying, a researcher in global economies at the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations. \"Multinational companies are facing competition from Chinese rival enterprises and rising costs of labor, but the market potential of Chinese consumers and China\\'s advantage in educated talent still attract overseas investors,\" Chen says. China, which now is encouraging foreign investments to move into high-end, low-carbon and sustainable industries, can improve the business environment and lower market access barriers by introducing negative lists and granting multinational companies national treatment, which may maintain its attractiveness, Chen says. Negative lists include only those activities that are off-limits in a sector, and all other activities are considered open.

       " ['Innovation requires tolerance of failure nan China\\'s state-owned enterprises are administered by governments at various levels. The number of those monitored by the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council stands at 103, after years of streamlining efforts. But as shown in the recently issued Outline of Central Government-led Enterprises\\' 13th Five-Year Development Plan, they are saddled with great responsibility in achieving innovation-driven development in a bid to help realize the country\\'s goal of power through innovation. In fact, in recent years, based on some inherent technology advantages, central government-led enterprises have continuously refreshed the innovation record. For example, scientists have utilized aerospace plasma technology to overcome the lean coal ignition problem; China National Offshore Oil Corp completed its first high-yield well test in 2015; and the Shenzhou-11 spacecraft solar wing was 100 percent made in China.   The R&D input by central government-led enterprises has exceeded 25 percent of China\\'s total, which is already responsible for more than 2 percent of its GDP. In 2015, central government-led enterprises won 86 National Science and Technology Awards, or 34 percent of the total. However, they still have a long way to go. The outline has raised a new goal for the enterprises: continuously optimizing the structure of state-owned capital; substantively improving the enterprises\\' innovation-driven development capacity; cultivating a group of multinational corporations with innovation capacity; and boosting international competitiveness. Compared with the multinationals in developed countries, the Chinese enterprises lack strong in-house innovation. Many in developed countries have large-scale R&D institutes, and a large number of personnel. The R&D input remains at a high level. Take Dupont for instance. The company had Charles J. Pederson, winner of Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1987, in its innovation lab. Because of the comparative weakness of the in-house system, central government-led enterprises in China are in short of originality and innovative capabilities. Right now, a large proportion of R&D capacity in China is confined to universities and research institutions, rather than being possessed by enterprises. For future innovation capacity building, China needs to adjust the distribution of R&D resources, transferring more to enterprises. Otherwise, the country may get a lot of R&D output, but without harvesting the fruits of innovation. Since the reform and opening-up policy was adopted, China has developed into the world\\'s factory and has achieved fast economic growth. The technology progress pattern of this round of fast economic development was \"technology importation, assimilation and re-innovation\".  Most of the innovation activities carried out by large government-led enterprises - such as China Railway Corp, China Mobile, China National Petroleum Corp and China Petroleum and Chemical Corp - followed this trajectory. However, while the technology gap between China and developed countries is continuously narrowing, the previous pattern of technology progress will not be sustainable. If Chinese enterprises cannot upgrade from technology follower to innovation leader, it can be foreseen that they will fall into a trap in the technology race - that is, while they may approach the high technology level through the old learning pattern, once a new technology field comes into being, they will find themselves on the ebb again. Therefore, at present, the government-led enterprises face a new innovation goal, with internal and external challenges. Furthermore, the previous innovation trajectory needs to be overhauled as the country enters a new round in global technology competition. Notably, the Chinese government has provided strong policy support to its enterprises, including the Interim Incentive Measures on Equity and the Dividend for the State-owned Science and Technology Enterprises. But while a supporting political environment is in place, the enterprises still need to make efforts from within to change conventional thinking and behavior, and cultivate an innovation culture. They need to develop a culture that tolerates failure. Original innovation progresses by drawing from failures. However, the government-led enterprises do not have such a culture, which means few projects can be terminated halfway. Nowadays, a newborn innovation model - \"iterative innovation\", which pushes semi-mature products to the market, and then continuously improves them based on market feedback - has been adopted by some industries that are in highly uncertain and competitive positions. This new model is flexible and effective, bringing many enterprises to a position of advantage in an environment of furious competition. Central government-led enterprises can hardly embrace this innovation model without rejecting the current management model and creating a new mindset that bravely faces and utilizes failures in the course of technology advancement. Meanwhile, the enterprises need to develop a culture that dares to put innovative R&D personnel at center stage. When they plan projects, R&D personnel are not in a position to make their own decisions. Therefore, the incentives and enthusiasm for original innovation are not in place within the enterprises. The ice of bureaucratic hierarchy and authority division should be broken, opening smooth channels for innovation activities. In an era of globalized innovation, manufacturing activities will no longer be high value-added. Chinese enterprises developed strong manufacturing capacity in the past, which supported industrialization. However, it only brought China to the starting line in the new competitive global race, and cannot guarantee winning the medal for technology power. Central government-led enterprises need a more risk-taking innovation culture, putting innovation first on their agenda. They need innovation multitasking to realize the transformation mission.

       " ['Open, frequent exchanges will foster better UK ties nan As the world faces more uncertainty, partnership between nations could provide a platform for increased understanding As the British and Chinese governments concluded their latest strategic dialogue on Dec 20 - with both sides reaffirming their commitment to a Sino-British \"golden era\" amid the uncertainty created by Brexit - the world today looks very different from October 2015, when President Xi Jinping paid a high-profile state visit to the United Kingdom. The first challenge 2016 brought to UK-China ties was Brexit, which will require the UK to develop its China policy without the benefit of a multilayered approach where objectives are pursued both bilaterally and with the support of the more influential European Union. The UK will therefore find itself on the spot more with respect to China, whether on human rights or trade policy. This might also create opportunities for Beijing. Most attention has focused on a free trade agreement, with business voices expressing support for such a move. However, caution is in order. An agreement that is good for the UK will involve much greater access to China\\'s service sector, but it is not yet clear whether China is prepared to grant that. Besides, as many have pointed out, depending on the content, a UK-China agreement could constrain London in reaching an all-important future trade agreement with Brussels. Nor is it clear that it would push the EU toward its own free trade agreement with China, as Beijing might hope. The second major factor that will hang over the agenda is uncertainty over the impact of a Donald Trump presidency in the United States. Although it is still too early to judge what strategic direction Trump will take, judging by his critical tone on the campaign trail, there is a good chance he will take a tougher line on China than his predecessor Barack Obama. We can expect more uncertain times.    This is not good for Europeans, who are wary of the next US president. Greater uncertainty and friction in US-China relations tend to heighten tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, making the regional prosperity and stability that contribute to Europe\\'s economic security more difficult to achieve. The UK, whose new government has reiterated its commitment to pursuing good relations with China, may find itself at the sharp end of this, especially as it concurrently looks to get the London-Washington relationship onto an even footing. The challenges for UK policymakers can be seen in some recent mixed messages about its approach to East Asia. The British foreign secretary said in a recent talk at Chatham House that \"the emerging balance of power system in Asia needs the influence of friendly countries\", while there has been some lack of clarity over remarks by the UK\\'s ambassador to the US on the possibility of the British military engaging in \"freedom of navigation\" operations in the South China Sea, something that would exacerbate the security dilemma in the region. The UK, ideally working with the EU despite Brexit, should be encouraging a modus vivendi between China and the US in East Asia, on the basis of a balanced and impartial approach. London\\'s response to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Belt and Road Initiative (the Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road) set the right tone, demonstrating an openness to a changing world order. The talk of a Sino-British \"golden era\" aside, the more significant achievement of Xi\\'s state visit to the UK was the establishment of a comprehensive global strategic partnership. This partnership should provide the basis for open, honest and frequent exchanges of views on the full range of global interests. Of course, this does not mean the two governments agree on everything - far from it. But it does provide a platform for responding to the uncertainties facing the world, and for exploring reforms, to ensure the international system reflects changes in the global and regional distribution of power.

       " ['Stop capital flight by reducing taxes nan The way to encourage industries to keep jobs in the country is to lower the burden of costs they are hampered by News that China\\'s largest automobile glass-maker Fuyao Group is to invest $600 million (570.3 million euros; 486 million) to build a 2,000-worker factory in Moraine, Ohio, in the United States should set off alarm bells, prompting the Chinese government to lower taxes and operating costs for manufacturing industries to prevent the drain of Chinese capital and jobs. Responding to criticisms of his investment abroad in a recent interview, Cao Dewang, chairman and founder of Fuyao Glass Industry Group in Fujian province, complained about the heavy tax burden in China. Cao, who started investing small amounts in the United States in 1995, said it took him more than 20 years of observation to make the \"prudent\" decision two months ago, because there is an obvious gap in production and operational costs between China and the US.    Taxes on enterprises, electricity tariffs and natural gas costs in China are all higher than in the US, he said. And compared with a number of fees an enterprise has to pay for using land in China, land is virtually free to use in the US, thanks to local subsidies. The high cost of production and the heavy tax burden on manufacturing enterprises are facts many in China already knew. But it is Cao who first highlighted that in China they were not just high, but much higher than in the US. At the recently concluded Central Economic Work Conference, the central government pledged to lower taxes, fees and other costs to foster the development of the real economy. So Cao\\'s remarks immediately after the conference should spur the authorities in charge of reform to put their words into action. Although China has deepened economic reform through a series of measures since late 2012, the production and operating costs for enterprises, including labor and institutional transaction costs, have increased. All costs ultimately find their way into retail prices paid by consumers, so, many enterprises, including well-established ones, will either have to accept the loss of their competitiveness as buyers opt for alternative products at lower prices, or they can relocate overseas to places where production costs are lower and the business environment better. In fact, many Chinese enterprises have moved their production bases to foreign economies, especially Southeast Asian countries, in recent years. And this trend is likely to gather pace in the future. Because of its re-industrialization strategy, the US government is seeking to attract manufacturing industries, including foreign ventures, back to the country, as they are not only important taxpayers but also job generators. If the cost gap Cao talked about is true, Chinese people should not lament the shifting of Fuyao Group\\'s production unit; instead, they should appreciate the fact that many Chinese enterprises have not moved to the US. The government has made some breakthroughs in tax reform. But it\\'s far from enough. The enterprise tax rate in China is still markedly higher than in developed countries. So the government should not only see how much tax it has cut; it should also see how much could still be cut. US President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to lower enterprises\\' tax from 35 percent to 15 percent. The Chinese reform authorities should show the same sense of urgency to protect Chinese capital and enterprises. Behind the tax reform is a deeper level of reform - that of the government itself, as well as the national administrative system. The author is a Beijing-based financial columnist.

       " ['Even men can suffer from domestic violence nan The Mentougou district court in western Beijing recently issued a restraining order against a woman who had abused her husband, surnamed Zhang, in a number of incidents of domestic violence. It is the first such order to be issued in Beijing, and one of the first of its kind nationwide. The court order, not surprisingly, has sparked a debate on social media. While many netizens have expressed sympathy for the man, some say they do not believe a man can be beaten up by his wife. A few have even made fun of Zhang, saying he is \"not man enough\" and \"a true man should fight back\". There is a common misunderstanding about domestic violence in China. When people talk about domestic violence, they envisage a man beating up his wife. That to a large extent is true, especially because men in general are stronger physically than women. But that does not necessarily mean only men can be bullies.    Last May, in a primary school in Huaiyuan county, Anhui province, a 13-year-old boy who was not identified by the media bullied his entire class of seven. He is shorter than the rest of his classmates and does not have any physical advantage, yet he succeeded in bullying his classmates because of his aggressive character. That happens in many families, too. Another common misunderstanding about domestic violence is that it is a family affair in which the judiciary should not intervene. This idea runs so deep in some people\\'s minds that they have even invented precepts to support their view: A good judge does not pass rulings in cases related to family affairs. No one is innocent in a fight. The victim must also have faults. When incidents of domestic violence happen in some rural areas, relatives and friends of the family often intervene only to persuade the victim to forget the physical pain and humiliation for the sake of \"maintaining peace in the family\" and some victims even agree to it, which often leads to more severe domestic violence. An All-China Women\\'s Federation survey showed that victims call the police only after suffering domestic violence 35 times on average. Worse, some judicial officials seem to share a distorted view, too, and thus adopt a laissez-faire attitude toward domestic violence. There have been too many cases in which police have refused to detain the perpetrators of domestic violence, claiming that it is a \"family matter\". This belief is so widespread that only last July researchers at the Hunan Police Academy conducted their first training course for police officers to teach them how they can help domestic violence victims. Surprisingly, even during the training course, some officers insisted on not intervening in family matters, because they could not distinguish between normal family matters and domestic violence. That\\'s why the Mentougou court\\'s restraining order is important. It not only breaks the common impression that only women suffer domestic violence but also shows the judiciary\\'s firm determination to protect all domestic violence victims. This, in the long run, will help improve the rule of law in China. It may be not possible to root out domestic violence from Chinese society within a short period, but we hope at least common misunderstandings about domestic violence can be removed from people\\'s minds.

       " ['Focus shifts from growth to structure nan Government report conveys confidence in the economic transition and an emphasis on deeper, more difficult reforms Much was decided about the direction of China\\'s economy at this year\\'s Central Economic Work Conference, which ran from Dec 14 to 16 in Beijing. Each December, Chinese leaders use the conference to map out their priorities for the year ahead, and to issue a communique summarizing the policies and targets they have chosen. Readers of the communique of the just-closed talks can tell that, other than the tasks to continue from 2016, there will probably be more, rather than less, reform measures undertaken next year. However, the communique did not mention a single word about growth. This is quite contrary to the nearly four-decade-long practice of a government that built its legitimacy on delivering the world\\'s top GDP growth rate. In the days following the conference, a research report by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences recommended that 2017\\'s GDP growth should be set at 6.5 percent, in line with the forecasts of many international investors. There has been little debate this year whether chasing so much growth is realistic, or whether it\\'s actually a good thing. What was not articulated is symbolic of change. It represents a shift of focus.    From the initial few years of its economic transformation, China has gained experience and confidence in maintaining a level of growth to, by and large, generate the jobs it needs without relying on exports and bailout money for state-owned enterprises. Compared with the first-generation problems in the transition, namely whether the country can survive shrinking export orders and the relocation of manufacturers to cheaper cities overseas, China can now focus on the more difficult problems, most importantly to accumulate experience in managing and protecting its financial system. This is exactly the focus of the Central Economic Work Conference - and its central task for 2017. China\\'s emphasis on speedy growth has historical roots dating to the beginning of the reform era. Deng Xiaoping, the leader of the reform, once said: \"Only development\" provides a solid basis for the future. Most Chinese interpret development in this case as meaning the growth rate. Through the 1990s and 2000s, China was the fastest-growing economy in the world. The speed of growth remained an issue of debate after the government-led transition began in 2013. International observers asked time and again whether a certain growth target is within China\\'s reach, considering the difficulties it faces at home and in the rest of the world. Last year, the government worked hard to achieve a year-on-year growth rate of 6.9 percent. The rate was 10.3 percent in 2010. The question remains whether it still makes sense to keep a growth target, be it a fixed figure or a certain range. The official target in Premier Li Keqiang\\'s government work report to the National People\\'s Congress is set as above 6.5 percent through the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20), and 6.5 to 7 percent for 2016. Some suggest that China should abandon its growth target once and for all. This is in order to avoid making big efforts to sustain growth when there are so many limitations, and for the government to save face if it fails to deliver the set rate. Since China managed to maintain a 6.7 percent growth rate in the first three quarters of 2016, little doubt exists about the achievement of its full-year target - even as its export orders continue to dwindle and world commodity prices continue to edge up. In fact, in the last couple of years, exports have stopped playing as important a role in China\\'s overall growth. And the fact that the nation is no longer set on being the world\\'s factory may well be seen as a timely precaution against the looming protectionism in today\\'s world. While the Central Economic Work Conference said nothing about growth, it did not mention foreign trade either. This suggests even more that China\\'s shift of focus is serious. So people may expect more attempts in 2017 to improve the country\\'s financial health, and especially to control the risk of the dangerous debt burden on its enterprises and local governments.

       " ['British railways have run out of steam nan No light at the end of the tunnel for a transport system that once was the undisputed world leader If you want to travel from Kunming to Shanghai, a mere 2,252 kilometers, it will take you 11 hours and 15 minutes- and you can bet your fancy high-speed train will be right on time. If you want to travel the 664 km from London to Edinburgh, it will take you nearly five hours, the train may well be delayed and you will have to pay extra to guarantee a seat. Traveling on China\\'s new high-speed, state-of-the-art trains costs you an average of 100 yuan an hour, travelling at around 350 km/h. Roughly put, it means the ticket between Kunming and Shanghai should cost you around 1,115 yuan, around 130 ($159; 152.6 euros) at current rates. Don\\'t ask me how I know this stuff - I just do. Taking that nightmare London-Edinburgh route - and it can be a nightmare - will cost you around 150. For a country that invented railways (1825, George Stephenson\\'s Stockton-to-Darlington line in northeast England, since you ask), Britain has made a pretty poor job of it in recent years.    And if strikes, delayed engineering works, malfunctioning signals and poor infrastructure weren\\'t enough, the government has just announced a 2.3 percent rise in rail fares across the board. I commute to work every day and, as things go, I\\'m luckier than most. Southeastern, which operates my service, is a little better than some of the other operators, although each time I climb the stairs from the car park I seem to be greeted by \"Southeastern apologizes for \", followed by the latest delay, excuse or cancellation. Reasons offered include unruly passengers, ice, snow, rain, leaves on the line, missing train crew and, believe it or not, strong winter sunshine in the drivers\\' eyes. I\\'ve always loved trains, especially the mystery of steam. I confess to having a box full of Hornby Dublo model engines, those splendidly made electric models of the golden era of British steam. I have beautifully detailed models of the Flying Scotsman, the Duchess of Hamilton and designer Sir Nigel Gresley\\'s Mallard, a streamlined monster that set the world speed record for a steam engine in 1938 and has never been beaten. I suppose it goes back to my childhood in the 1950s, when my father would take my mother and his sister by car (a 1937 Austin 14) from Oxford to Hartlepool, while we boys would go with my uncle by steam train, changing at Darlington for the two-hour run to West Hartlepool. What a trip - Mars bars, pork pies, fizzy drinks and a fresh comic book for the journey. Boyhood heaven.    All that, of course, was spoiled by a gentleman called Dr Richard Beeching, whose 1963 report on the state of Britain\\'s railways resulted in a shortsighted slashing of 2,636 stations and 5,000 miles of track. I personally don\\'t think the system has ever recovered. Since then, the nation\\'s rail network has become a political football. Of all the public facilities, railways should be run by one central entity - frankly, I don\\'t care if it is state-run or privately owned. After all, China, France and Germany, to name but a few places, all have one entity controlling their rail systems and it seems to work for them. Here, although the infrastructure is run by Network Rail, the services are run by a series of franchises awarded by the government, with varying degrees of success. Try to buy a ticket and you will be faced with a bewildering array of choices. No wonder many Britons opt to drive, overcrowding the motorways and adding to pollution. Next time I\\'m in China, China Railway Co will be getting my business, that\\'s for sure. The author is managing editor of China Daily European Bureau.

       " ['Ivory trade ban key to saving elephants nan Perhaps now profiteering will be seen as less respectable - and more people will enjoy seeing the glorious creatures in the wild Every 15 minutes or so an elephant is slaughtered by poachers to meet an international demand for ivory that threatens to wipe out the species within little more than a decade. An estimated two-thirds of that demand has come from China, where members of a growing middle class associate carved ivory products with luck and prosperity. The trade in trinkets, chopsticks and figurines has remained legal even though the government moved to ban imports of ivory. China has now taken a historic step to phase out the commercial ivory trade by the end of 2017, a decision that has been greeted as the single biggest hope for the survival of elephants since the modern poaching crisis began. \"Ending the legal ivory trade in China - the world\\'s largest consumer of elephant ivory - is critical to saving the species,\" wrote Elly Pepper of the US-based Natural Resources Defense Council, welcoming the Chinese government\\'s decision.    Britain\\'s Prince William, a prominent wildlife campaigner, said the Chinese ban was a potential turning point in the race to save elephants from extinction. \"I congratulate the Chinese government for following through on this important commitment,\" he said in a statement. Beijing\\'s action may indeed turn out to be the most important measure to preserve the species since the African elephant was first listed as endangered in 1989. But many other factors are involved and experts are reluctant to predict that the path to guaranteeing the future of the world\\'s largest land mammal is now secure. The Chinese authorities had already taken vigorous action against the illicit trade in ivory, which figured in President\\'s Xi Jinping\\'s well-publicized crackdown on corrupt officials. As recently as November, a man was jailed for 14 years after the biggest-ever seizure of illegal wildlife products in Beijing. When the prospect of a ban on the legal trade was first raised, officials publicly burned stockpiles of ivory. However, as China Daily reported, 40 tons of legal ivory remained stockpiled at the end of last year and could become a complicating factor in instituting the new ban. Experts also believe the effectiveness of the ban will depend on strengthened measures to combat smuggling. A recent surge in demand for ivory and rhino horn in Vietnam has been linked to possible smuggling networks. Under the measures China announced at the end of December, domestic ivory carving workshops and factories will shut down by the end of March and registered traders and processors will be phased out by the end of the year. Activists had argued that the legal trade had helped to disguise the illegal trade, because it was often impossible to determine the origin of raw ivory. The new ban addresses that challenge. However, there is still much to be done beyond China\\'s borders to confront the extinction threat. There is a need to deter poachers who earn a mere handful of dollars per kilo of ivory that is then sold to end-users for hundreds of times more.    That will involve more effective aid programs to improve the livelihoods of poor rural communities. But it will also demand more effective anti-poaching tactics. Blue Sky Rescue, one of China\\'s largest nongovernmental disaster rescue organizations, has sent volunteers to Africa to join local efforts in wildlife protection. Meanwhile, the UK government announced late last year that it was partnering with China to train African border forces to spot and stop smugglers involved in the illicit animal products trade. Such measures will help reinforce the impact of the ban on the legal trade announced by Beijing. Ultimately what will save the elephants will be a change in public attitudes. The state, wildlife activists and celebrities have joined in campaigns to educate Chinese consumers about the devastating impact of the ivory trade. Now that the legal trade is being banned, the desire to own ivory may become even less respectable. Prosperous consumers may eventually be persuaded that the most exciting way to enjoy ivory is to book an African safari and go and see it while it\\'s still attached to a living elephant.

At least 32 cities issued red alerts for air pollution, the highest emergency response in the four-tier system, according to the Ministry of Environmental Protection. Tong Yu / For China Daily  Smog prompts 309 flight cancellations in Tianjin Hundreds of flights have been canceled in north China\\'s port city of Tianjin because of the heavy smog that limited visibility on Jan 1. The municipal government has issued an orange alert for smog and haze on Saturday night. An orange alert means heavy pollution -- PM2.5 higher than 150 -- for three consecutive days. A total of 309 flights have been canceled, 15 forced to land in other airports and one returned as of 3 pm, according to the airport. Emergency plans have been activated to take care of the stranded passengers. TV series focuses on corruption cases A three-part anti-corruption documentary, produced by the Communist Party of China\\'s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and China Central Television, began airing nightly on Jan 3 at 8 pm on CCTV-1. The series provides the first full look inside the stories of corrupt officials, including luxurious lives lived at the public\\'s expense and tearful expressions of regret, with analysis of their illegal behavior and ideological transformation. The series was made to educate the public and to act as a strong warning to public servants, according to a statement by the commission. Farmers to share in business earnings China will reform collective ownership in rural areas in the next five years to enable farmers to have a share in the operating assets in their villages, a guideline issued by the central government said. Han Changfu, minister of agriculture, said at a news conference on Jan 3 that the move is aimed at increasing the income of farmers by ensuring their rights to a share of the assets. Earnings from such collective assets could come from factories, contracting services or other enterprises run by the village. Box office revenue stagnant in 2016 Movie box office takes for China\\'s film industry remained stagnant in 2016, but most industry insiders see it as a blessing in disguise. Last year\\'s box office total was predicted to reach 60 billion yuan (57.8 billion euros; 48.8 billion). Instead, it was 45.7 billion yuan, growing a mere 3.73 percent over 2015\\'s 44 billion yuan, the lowest in a decade. The construction of movie theaters rushed ahead at breakneck speed, with about 26 a day, or 9,552 new screens a year. China now has 41,179 movie screens, the most in the world, with 85 percent of them capable of projecting 3-D films. Foreign currency loophole closed    Chinese residents now need to fill out an application form indicating the purpose of foreign exchange purchases, reflecting strengthened scrutiny from the nation\\'s top currency regulator, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, amid renewed pressure from capital flight. The application form includes 11 purposes residents can check, including travel and medical care. The form specifies that residents will not be approved to purchase foreign currency if they hope to make overseas purchases not yet open to domestic individuals, such as overseas housing and insurance with investment returns. Tsai warned before her overseas trip The Chinese mainland will share development opportunities with Taiwan but at the same time firmly opposes \"Taiwan independence\" activities, Zhang Zhijun, head of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said in his New Year\\'s greeting. The remarks were issued a week ahead of Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen\\'s trip to Latin America, which was to start on Jan 7. Analysts said that if Tsai continues to provoke Beijing, Taiwan will face more punishment from the mainland. First freight train rolling to London China launched its first freight train to London on Jan 1, China Railway Corp said. Departing from Yiwu West Railway Station in Zhejiang province, the train will travel for 18 days over more than 12,000 kilometers before reaching its destination. It will pass through Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, Poland, Germany, Belgium and France before arriving in London. Xi urges more efforts to ensure food safety China\\'s top leadership has called for more efforts to ensure food safety, noting there are still many problems despite an improving food safety situation. More efforts should be made to ensure food safety for the public, said President Xi Jinping in his latest instructions on the country\\'s food safety work. The president called for the most rigorous standards, the most stringent regulation, the most severe punishment and the most serious accountability for improving food safety control. He stressed administration under the law, enhancement of work at the grassroots level and professionalism of food safety inspectors, and demanded a comprehensive food safety system from farm to table. 3 billion rail trips expected in 2017 China\\'s railways are forecasting at least 3 billion passenger trips in 2017, China Railway Corp said on Jan 3 during its annual meeting in Beijing. That would put the railroads over that mark for the first time. In 2016, 2.77 billion trips were made on China\\'s railways, including 1.44 billion trips by high-speed trains, which accounts for more than 52 percent of the total, according to Lu Dongfu, general manager of the railway operator. The record for a single day was 14.43 million trips, during October\\'s Golden Week holiday travel rush. China urges deeper BRICS partnership President Xi Jinping called on BRICS countries on Jan 1 to deepen their partnership for a brighter future. China will host the ninth summit of the leaders of BRICS countries - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - in Xiamen, a coastal city in Fujian province, in September, Xi said. Xi called for the enhanced partnership in a letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin, South African President Jacob Zuma, Brazilian President Michel Temer and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In the letter, he also briefed the leaders on China\\'s blueprint for promoting BRICS cooperation during Chinese presidency of the bloc this year. Mobile spending surges in 2016 Chinese mobile payments are expected to continue to surge overseas this year, as tech-savvy millennials increase spending on travel and purchases, analysts say. Outbound spending by Chinese tourists via mobile devices in 2016 jumped more than sevenfold year-on-year, with the number of transactions soaring by 730 percent, the country\\'s largest third-party payment provider, Alipay, said on Jan 4. Transactions made via mobile wallets could surge to 90 percent of total business volume this year, up from 71 percent last year, according to James Yan, research director at Counterpoint Technology Market Research. Government efficiency listed as top priority China will work harder to use simpler, more straightforward procedures and balanced market regulation to streamline government administration. A series of decisions to accomplish this goal was announced on Jan 4 during the State Council\\'s executive meeting, chaired by Premier Li Keqiang. The State Council is the highest executive agency of state power. The measures include delegating more authority to local governments and reducing central government certification and evaluation requirements. Also, the country will issue its first guideline for market supervision and regulation to make its business environment more inviting. Anti-graft effort satisfies 62% of public Six out of 10 people are satisfied with China\\'s anti-graft efforts in 2016, according to a poll by the top state-run think tank. The approval level among the public of 62 percent was higher for functionaries, at 95 percent, in the poll by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. The poll, based on more than 5,000 questionnaires, is part of the sixth annual report on the evaluation of China\\'s anti-graft drive released by the academy on Jan 4. The past year\\'s crackdown appears to be having the desired effect, says Jiang Laiyong, secretary-general of the government Integrity Research Center at the academy. Guideline sets limit on betrothal gifts A county in Henan province recently issued a guideline on arranging weddings and funerals in which it said that the total amount of money a man gives his fiancee\\'s family should not exceed 60,000 yuan ($8,645; 8,213 euros; 7,014). Betrothal gifts are a tradition deeply rooted in Chinese culture, especially in rural areas. The guideline, issued by the Taiqian county government, states that a wedding banquet should serve no more than 10 tables of guests and the total number of vehicles used should be six or fewer. Those who don\\'t follow the rules will be punished, according to the guideline. Ring road in Lhasa expected to ease traffic    Lhasa, capital of the Tibet autonomous region, is expected to have a ring road opened by June this year to improve traffic flow and accelerate the city\\'s development. With a planned investment of 11.3 billion yuan ($1.62 billion; 1.53 billion euros; 1.31 billion), the ring road is nearly 100 kilometers long, with seven tunnels and 27 bridges, according to the city government. The road links Lhasa Gongkar Airport in the south and with three highways. It also crosses over the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. After it opens, drivers will be able to circle the city\\'s downtown area in just two hours at a maximum speed of 60 km/h. 16 million illegal publications seized Law enforcement officers confiscated more than 16 million illegal publications last year, and shut down or banned more than 14,000 websites disseminating \"harmful information\". The figures were released by the National Office Against Pornographic and Illegal Publications on Jan 4. In 2016, the office disposed of more than 4.5 million items of online pornography as well as other harmful information, handling more than 600 criminal cases. More than 1,300 people were criminally punished. 500 new electric buses hit the road A fleet of 500 electric buses hit the roads on Jan 4 in Tianjin, increasing the number of such buses to 1,346. The buses, the result of a joint venture between Tianjin Bus Group and Shenzhen-based carmaker BYD, have a range of more than 200 kilometers on a full charge, says Wang Deqi of the bus group, adding that that\\'s enough for a bus to run its daily route. The group also opened a charging station capable of serving 80 buses at one time and 448 buses in a day. Telefraud suspects back from Vietnam Five telecom fraud suspects have been repatriated from Vietnam, the Ministry of Public Security announced on Jan 4. The suspects - one from the Chinese mainland and four from Taiwan - were arrested following allegations that they had been masquerading as law enforcement officials to extort money from people in Zhejiang province through telephone scams. The five have been implicated in at least 27 fraud cases involving more than 1.33 million yuan ($191,300; 181,754 euros; 155,213), the ministry said.

       " ['\\'Our exhaustion is worth it\\' nan Provincial environmental supervisors make big effort to support central inspection team It was an inspection carried out with a certain level of stress, both physically and psychologically, for Zhao Zhenwei, head of the Heilongjiang provincial Environmental Supervision Bureau. On July 19, a central inspection team officially started its monthlong operation in Heilongjiang - \"a surprise and swift inspection, and also the first thorough inspection of the environment from such a high-level team in the past 20 years,\" says Zhao, who started working there in 1993. The inspection became the top priority in his work, as well as the province\\'s.    As the head of the provincial supervision team for the environment, Zhao led teams to support the central inspectors. The major task was to collect materials, coordinate work and convey inspectors\\' demands down to lower departments and governments. In the first 10 days, the inspectors widely reviewed policies and materials related to the environment, and searched for major meeting records on environmental protection from more than 60 districts and counties since 2013. The environmental bureaus usually did not keep such records. And most governments didn\\'t expect such thorough reviews, Zhao says. \"The counties and districts handed in the documents quickly, the next day after receiving notice,\" he says. \"There were so many documents that they were delivered in bags and I had to carry them to the inspectors by cart.\" \"It\\'s quite exhausting because we usually ran to give them the materials they needed,\" he says, adding that the coordination teams lived nearby the inspectors and usually worked late with them. As coordinators, Zhao and his team also participated in other tasks, some of which were not done ahead of the central inspection. For example, they talked with 27 provincial leaders, \"which reminded us that they are serious and will play it hard\", he recalls. In addition, Zhao felt the mental strain. He had \"concerns that they would expose some problems we hadn\\'t\". That didn\\'t mean the province was hiding anything, he says. \"We took it as a chance to check ourselves and to improve environmental protection,\" he says. Plants in some polluting industries, such as quarries, would work as long as they had licenses, he adds, noting, \"We can work more smoothly\". After a month of intense scrutiny, companies became more willing to protect the environment. Moreover, more policymakers have realized their responsibility for protecting the environment and for more cooperation with regular local inspections, he says. For example, residents living near the Haotian corn processing plant in Suihua city have complained about the unpleasant odor for at least two years. The plant, whose emissions already met government standards, made some efforts but did not completely control the smell. However, after the problem was identified by the central inspectors, the company invested more to finally solve the problem in September. \"Many long-standing problems that we have taken many measures to curb, yet failed, have been solved because of the inspectors,\" Zhao says. \"The monthlong inspection has deep influence for environmental protection in Heilongjiang, which will spur us to work more efficiently in the future. Our exhaustion is worth it.\" zhengjinran@chinadaily.com.cn  (China Daily European Weekly 01/06/2017 page7)'],\n",
       " [\"Data tamperers face tough penalties nan False readings are an open secret - but now perpetrators risk criminal charges A new judicial interpretation from China's top court and procuratorate has been added to the country's list of environmental crimes. Now, anyone who falsifies data to avoid pollution regulation will be subject to prosecution. The move is expected to help regulate behavior by companies, monitoring agencies and governments. The interpretation, which took effect on Jan 1, is the third to deal with pollution since 1997 and represents a big step in the country's progress toward accurate and authentic environmental data. The judicial interpretations specify actions to which Chinese Criminal Law applies, making the rules easier to enforce. The environmental data include what is collected from the monitoring equipment of companies that discharge water and airborne pollutants, and air, water and soil quality measurements from stations set up by governments. As China has drawn attention over its environmental protection efforts, the data have come to play an increasingly important role in providing policymakers with an accurate picture as they frame public policy. The newly released judicial interpretation says that any major pollutant emitters that tamper with or fabricate monitoring data, or that interfere with the normal operation of monitoring equipment, can be criminally prosecuted and face three to seven years imprisonment and fines in cases with severe consequences.    Other new stipulations target agencies that provide monitoring equipment and services, as well as government officials who falsify the record. It's the first time that such acts have been made punishable as crimes. In the past, they were only punished by administrative penalties, such as 15-days of detention. Currently, the falsification of data by some companies is an open secret, and a thorny problem in the environmental protection efforts of governments at all levels, because it hinders their ability to control pollution - a top priority for both leaders and the public. Some companies may deliberately tamper with the monitoring data to reduce the cost of maintaining equipment or to avoid fines if the authorities were to discover excessive emissions. Now, officials may be punished or barred from job promotions if they falsified data. Punishments also apply to environmental bureaus. In the past, there was little risk in falsifying data to reflect better performance. In March, equipment at an air quality monitoring station in Xi'an city of Shaanxi province was found covered with cotton yarn to filter the air and lower pollution readings to avoid punitive action. But no criminal penalty was attached to the act at that time. Such violations will be punished strictly under the new judicial interpretation, to deter other officials from misbehavior. Agencies providing monitoring equipment and services will be subject to regulation. Individual violators could face a penalty of more than five years in prison. China has confronted many issues as it has enacted a range of environmental pollution controls, especially in efforts to reduce the number of smoggy days to satisfy public demand for clean air and a healthy life. To make progress, the central government has already adopted a number of measures, including the issuance of new regulations and launching of national action plans targeting air, water and soil pollution. But the legal step of adding criminal penalties may be be the most effective and powerful weapon to date. Moreover, governments need to better utilize market rules to induce companies to upgrade their production equipment and technologies willingly, and to guide related service agencies to establish and maintain a good reputation by providing authentic and accurate data, which can only help them retain market share in a growing field.

Artist Dong Lin, 25, depicts these climate phenomena in a series of ceramic sculptures, 24 Solar Terms, which she began a year ago in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province, China\\'s ceramics capital. Based on observations of the sun\\'s annual motion, the ancient Chinese created a calendar dividing the year into 24 segments, each given a specific \"solar term\" , or jieqi. The system provided a time frame for agriculture, everyday life and festivals. Dong is now exhibiting the first six ceramics of her ongoing series in a solo exhibition at Beijing\\'s Soka Art Center. She has named each piece after a solar term - such as Insects Awakening (jingzhe) and Grain Rain (guyu). \"The idea came to me when I saw a Weibo posting about the solar terms. The names sounded so poetic and inspired my imagination,\" she says. Dong used the zhan jing pan technique, a method of creating miniature landscapes used during the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220). She molded mountains, rocks and animals, and arranged them in a ceramic pot to portray natural scenery corresponding to a solar term. Each work was given a different colored glaze. The red tone of End of Heat (chushu) indicates summer fever; the yellow of Autumnal Equinox (qiufen) suggests a harvest; and the silver of Light Snow (xiaoxue) symbolizes the arrival of winter. \"Dong\\'s works offer not only a novel visual experience,\" says exhibition curator Sun Yiwei, \"but also have a lingering charm because of deeply rooted Chinese cultural traditions.\" The solar terms themselves recently found favor with the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, part of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, or UNESCO. On Nov 30, the committee added the Chinese 24 Solar Terms to the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity during its 11th session held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The committee examined 37 applications bidding to be inscribed on the list. The addition of the solar terms increased the number of Chinese items on the list to 31. The committee said the inscription would give Chinese people an awareness of \"the importance of transmitting and safeguarding intangible cultural heritage at the national level, as well as an enhanced understanding of the regional variations of solar terms\". It also said the inscription would advance international dialogue on traditional systems of knowledge about time, so that people would appreciate and respect cultural diversity and human creativity. Fifth invention The solar terms are viewed as \"China\\'s fifth invention\" in international meteorological circles. The system originated in areas along the Yellow River, which for a long time served as China\\'s political and economic center. A solar term is any of the 24 points on the traditional Chinese lunisolar calendar that matches an astronomical event or signifies a natural phenomenon. The points are spaced 15 degrees apart along an ellipse and were used to keep lunisolar calendars synchronized with the seasons. The calendar combines lunar and solar observations. Surviving historical files show that the Lyushi Chunqiu (or Master Lyu\\'s Spring and Autumn Annals), an encyclopedic Chinese classic text compiled around 239 BC, first recorded eight terms corresponding to four seasons. Huai nanzi, a classical essay collection from 139 BC, mentioned 24 terms identical to those of today. In 104 BC, the Taichu Calendar (the Grand Inception Calendar), China\\'s first official calendar with complete written records, integrated 24 solar terms to reaffirm their status in astronomy, based on which successive dynasties created their own official calendars. Having been merged into the Gregorian calendar, the system has been passed down for generations to guide agriculture. Liu Xiaofeng, a history professor at Tsinghua University, says the solar terms predict a general trend of temperature and rainfall and, therefore, were essential for Chinese farmers, who needed to make the best use of climatic conditions. The different periods are marked nationwide with rituals and festivities, although there are variations between regions and ethnic groups. During the Beginning of Spring (lichun) solar term, that normally falls on Feb 3-5, people in Suichang county, Zhejiang province, used to set off fireworks, arrange plum blossoms in pots and hold sacrificial ceremonies to the gods of the land, among other spring celebrations. By doing so, they notified each other of the need to prepare for field plowing. The ceremonies, known as banchun quannong (or encouraging agrarian activities at the arrival of spring), came to halt in the chaotic early 20th century. They have been revived in some communities since the 1980s. A a folk culture museum was opened in 2009 displaying objects and materials relating to local agricultural development. The traditions were inscribed on the list of state-level intangible cultural heritage in 2011, being preserved as an extended item of the 24 Solar Terms. Liu says that although more than half of the Chinese population now live in cities, the system is still important today as it encourages a harmonious relationship with nature and sustainable development. Li Ting, a popular Beijing-based science writer and postdoctoral researcher of atmospheric physics, says these days the solar terms have more cultural than astronomical significance. \"Weather forecasts based on scientific measurements have become so advanced that they can provide a better guide for agriculture,\" she says. \"However, the solar terms reflect the wisdom of the ancient Chinese, and this knowledge has contributed to an understanding of natural life cycles.\" Common festivals Li adds that some solar terms are now common festivals, such as the Qingming Festival, which marks the Fresh Green solar term, a time in which people nationwide make excursions to the countryside and worship their ancestors. She also notes that because many events associated with solar terms are held in rural areas, they are at risk of waning as more people move to urban areas. Efforts are thus being made at both the grassroots and national level to transmit some of the cultural cohesion provided by the solar terms to the younger generation, through formal and informal education. Wang Yingde, a researcher at the Beijing-based China Agricultural Museum, says the museum has worked with several representative communities to formulate a five-year plan, beginning in 2017, for a series of measures designed to protect the traditions. Communities boasting varieties of solar term traditions include Anren county, in central Hunan province, where people trade herbal medicines at fairs and cook them with pork in an annual routine marking the spring equinox (chunfen). Wang says courses on how to safeguard traditions will be offered in certain communities and then spread to more areas. He says schoolbooks about the solar terms will be compiled, and relevant oral and paper documents and artifacts will be collected and cataloged in digital format, as well shown in exhibitions. He adds that the museum runs a website dedicated to the 24 Solar Terms. It provides basic information, photos and videos and will be enhanced by incorporating interactive digital technologies to engage more people, especially children and teenagers, he says. Bamo Qubumo, an expert on ethnic literature and the conservation of intangible cultural heritage at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, says the vitality of solar terms can only be maintained when they become part of everyday life for young people. Advanced digital technologies are of great help in achieving this. She says more apps, images and such things as animations and online games are needed to engage young people\\'s interest. \"The 24 Solar Terms boast an extensive sea of knowledge and practices that all Chinese people should explore,\" she says, \"because every one of us is responsible for keeping the traditions alive.\" Contact the writer through linqi@chinadaily.com.cn China\\'s 24 Solar Terms                   (China Daily European Weekly 01/06/2017 page1)'],\n",
       " ['Taking a breath of fresh air nan Vigorous enforcement effort behind the scenes is tackling pollution by taking aim at regional officials Residents in Beijing have already experienced hazardous smog in the early days of the new year, while at least 60 cities in the northern region have adopted joint emergency measures to reduce emissions, including the short-term shutdown of some factory operations. But there\\'s another effort going on behind the scenes that\\'s making a big difference. The central government has sharpened its supervision of policymakers across the country through high-level environmental inspections, which have grown into a powerful enforcement tool. Since the central inspectors made their debut with a monthlong inspection in Hebei province in January 2016, they have been busy expanding the effort to 16 provincial-level areas. The latest inspections were completed on Dec 30, according to the Ministry of Environmental Protection.    Through the end of last year, polluters have been fined more than 441 million yuan ($63 million; 60.7 million euros; 51.7 million), and 597 people who were accused of polluting the environment were detained, according to the ministry. Enforcement is no longer focused solely on polluting companies. The center of the storm against polluters has shifted from companies to governments - \"highlighting the major role of policymakers in environmental issues\", says Chen Jining, minister of environmental protection. In the inspection undertaken in mid-July, more than 40,000 people at both the central and local levels have participated in monthlong inspections, which have covered Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Henan and Yunnan provinces, and the Ningxia Hui, Inner Mongolia and Guangxi Zhuang autonomous regions. Since late November, the inspection teams have visited seven provincial-level areas - Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, as well as Hubei, Guangdong, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. Chen says that within two years, the inspections will have covered all provincial regions. Accountability The State Council, China\\'s cabinet, sent inspection teams in January, mid-July and late November - a large-scale \"accountability storm\" aimed at the governments. China has introduced laws and regulations stipulating that key leaders should play a major role in environmental protection, but the implementation of such measures has not been stellar. Similar to the inspections ordered by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection to check for cases of official corruption, the high-level inspectors are looking for environmental lapses and offenses. The inspectors hold talks with leading officials, conduct field investigations, receive reports from the public via phone and mail, and review official documents. The teams review the governments\\' performance at the provincial and local levels to see if they have met set standards or neglected their duties in relation to pollution control, and will investigate major issues frequently reported by the public. In the 16 inspected regions so far, including industrialized and developing regions, the teams have exposed long-existing problems in governmental management of environmental issues, and have not withheld details, which illustrates the central government\\'s determination, experts say.    For example, Zhengzhou, Henan province, failed to meet its air pollution reduction goal in 2015, while the annual assessment for the city was labeled good, which means the city government did not realize the importance of environmental protection, according to Wang Wanbin, head of the central inspection team for Henan province. Similar neglect and weak implementation of environmental protection measures was exposed in other provinces, which is one of the priorities among the inspection teams\\' tasks. For example, since the Yunnan provincial government released its Regulation on Fuxian Lake Protection in 2007, many illegal buildings - including hotels, apartments and villas with total floor area of 140,000 square meters - have been built inside the protection zone and are still for sale. Yang Chunming, deputy head of the Yunnan provincial Environmental Protection Bureau, says the province initiated special teams to correct the problems immediately after receiving the inspection report. \"We have conducted serious investigations on the illegal construction at Fuxian Lake,\" he says, adding that other exposed problems will be treated seriously. The inspections provide \"a chance for us to improve our environmental protection\", he says. Zhang Benxing, a 73-year-old resident of Xiangshan district in Guilin city, in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, says some of the villagers reported illegal quarrying, which created heavy dust around the nationally known scenic area on the Lijiang River. After that, 37 officials at the county and city level were found to have been responsible. The reports revealed issues commonly found in the 16 inspected regions, including insufficient attention by leadership to environmental protection, lax implementation of pollution-control measures and improper exploitation of resources in natural reserves. Some areas have experienced environmental degradation, with air, water and soil quality suffering, the reports said. After the inspections, around 6,400 government officials were held accountable, with punishments including suspensions, public criticism and lost promotions, the ministry said. \"From the problems exposed by the inspectors, we can see they play hardball in monitoring the governments, and that has helped the policymakers do better with the environment rather than just promoting economic growth,\" says Qin Tianbao, professor of environmental law at Wuhan University in Hubei province. He says the governments have behaved better after the inspections, especially after witnessing or receiving punishments. But after the intense monthlong inspections, the mechanism needs to become a long-term system, he says. \"It\\'s better if there are laws to back up such inspections.\"    The central inspections have been conducted in accordance with a trial regulation from the State Council. Some governments have set up their own inspection and investigation systems to more effectively control pollution - Henan province and Inner Mongolia, for example. Chang Jiwen, deputy director of the Institute for Resources and Environment Policies at the State Council Development Research Center, a high-level think tank, agrees that progress has been made with the large number of cases exposed. But he suggests the central inspection teams should focus more on provincial and city governments. \"The leading policymakers in the province have more influence over the environment than environmental officials at the grassroots,\" he says. Strict controls Along with the monitoring of officials, the inspectors have focused attention on pollution problems at companies, after receiving reports from the public by phone or mail. Subsequent inspections exposed and transferred more than 26,000 cases to related governments. More than 20,000 polluting companies were required to cease polluting and were given huge fines. \"The strict investigations have promoted solutions to many long-existing thorny problems,\" Chang says. A pharmaceutical factory located in Hulunbuir, in Inner Mongolia, was reported 80 times during the inspection month because of the bad odor it emitted. \"The plant has been punished administratively 29 times by the environmental bureaus at the city and regional levels, but the plant continued in production and generating the odor,\" according to a statement from the region. After the inspection, the governments conducted thorough investigations and detained two people accused of pollution. The plant subsequently suspended production, the statement said. For some polluters, administrative punishments from the environmental authorities are not a strong deterrent, and the central inspectors have helped the governments put a tighter leash on them. Tighter control has brought pollution in some regions under control, Chang says. But it\\'s better that the governments adopt legal weapons against the pollution instead of the relying on the short-term inspection, like fully implementing the revised Environmental Protection Law, he says. Zhang Xiaode, director of the Ecological Civilization Research Center at the Chinese Academy of Governance, says the central inspections have demonstrated the government\\'s determination to improve the environment, and the effort has proved to be effective. It has also sent a signal to society that the environment is related to social and economic growth, he says, adding that it has also helped governments identify issues and find effective solutions.   Â\\xa0 Inspectors examine a factory in Xingtai, Hebei province. Enforcement is no longer focused solely on polluting companies.

Now we can see the entire sky,\" Lu Lin, a 30-year-old volunteer, says excitedly as he points to nearby industrial chimneys. Four companions join him in a sigh of relief. What is getting them excited is the suspension of operations at Yunnan Xianfeng Chemical Industry Co, a state-owned enterprise related to the coal industry in Xundian county, Yunnan province. Inspectors from the central government declared on Nov 23 that its polluting emissions were severe. \"The suspension of production should be credited to the central inspectors and the wide participation of the public,\" he says. \"The fumes from the chimneys would spread out and cover half the county and part of the sky. The odor was bad and people coughed a lot.\"   - A woman takes a picture during heavy smog in Shanghai. Provided to China Daily  Lu has kept note of emissions from the plant for more than six months, after seeing a news report. He and his teammates in a volunteer group called Good Air Protector have conducted field research in nearby communities to see the effect of the plant\\'s discharges. \"A pond was severely polluted, and it\\'s hard to breathe when they put out fumes morning and night,\" Lu says. Some residents say they developed debilitating conditions in their lungs, which may be related to the fumes, he says. But the plant had continued to produce and discharge the fumes since 2014, despite requirements from the environmental protection bureaus at county, city and provincial levels, according to a statement from the central inspectors. Villagers took a chance and reported to the inspectors - as many as 46 times in the first two weeks after the inspection began. The inspectors ordered the province to investigate. Even then, the plant continued to pollute, but further reporting by the media and an ongoing stream of complaints from residents brought on the suspension, Lu says. \"Our research materials will be handed to the authorities if they need them during the investigation,\" he adds, noting that other volunteers exposed the pollution problem in social media, which put the case in the public spotlight. \"The central inspection and wide public participation have helped the villagers breathe better air,\" Lu says, adding that his group will continue to follow up on updates about the plant during the suspension. The central inspections have attracted public attention to some 20,000 pollution cases in 16 provincial-level areas. Zhang Yu, a 28-year-old woman who works in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, says some residents in her community complained to the central inspectors about emissions from a small restaurant whose fumes had stained the area near its chimney. The restaurant was shut down. \"I\\'m satisfied to see the changes after the reports - meaning that after we participated in monitoring, we were able to see the improvement,\" Zhang says.

       " ['How to achieve more with less in business nan The concept helps to improve productivity and sustainability by forging connections between people, production and technology, says Rockwell Automation\\'s chief \"Doing more with less\" is Blake Moret\\'s buzzphrase. In his book, even in the age of cost-conscious corporate culture, \"less\" need not always mean fewer workers or a thinner wage bill, and \"more\" could very well mean more \"indirect\" jobs. Moret, Rockwell Automation\\'s president and CEO, and a mechanical engineer by training, is passionate about his vision called Connected Enterprise, a concept or solution he believes can help people and enterprises to do more with less. So, he is driving its acceleration through innovation, leveraging his in-depth knowledge of customers\\' business needs.   - Blake Moret, Rockwell Automation\\'s president and CEO, says Chinese manufacturers should have a step-by-step approach to technology changes. Provided to China Daily  That knowledge is his by dint of decades of working with one of the world\\'s largest industrial automation and information companies by market value. Moret has 31 years of broad experience with Rockwell Automation, a leading provider of industrial automation power, control and information solutions for manufacturers. He has held leadership roles in marketing, solutions, services and product groups. He assumed his current role in July. Doing more with less, in a China context, is to maximize the application of the Connected Enterprise to deliver the future today, he said. The idea is closely related to China\\'s campaign to upgrade its manufacturing sector through the Made in China 2025 and Internet Plus initiatives. According to Moret, the Connected Enterprise solution forges connections between people, production processes and technology through information-sharing and internet connectivity. This will, in turn, enable enterprises to significantly improve productivity, sustainability and performance, he says. The solution, based on a synergized control and information structure, offers enterprises a smarter, safer and more productive manufacturing environment.    During his frequent visits to China, Moret is often found in meeting rooms with clients, or at manufacturing sites, listening to customers\\' latest needs. Recently, he spoke with China Daily about the company\\'s strategy, business opportunities and prospects. Following are edited excerpts from the interview: What are the major changes China\\'s manufacturers are facing in the process of cutting overcapacity and contributing to the Made in China 2025 campaign? In the past, it was enough just to provide equipment that would enable greater capacity or to replace older equipment. But today, there must be additional value, such as faster time to market, lower total cost of ownership, increased asset utilization and better management of enterprise risk. It\\'s also important to note that rarely does a manufacturer make the change all at once. So they should have a step-by-step approach and be able to put a foundation in place that\\'s future-proof, so that you can take advantage of additional new technology in the future. What are some of these additional values? One example: We have provided additional value to a luxury automotive manufacturer, where again it\\'s not enough just to be able to provide the means for enabling additional capacity, but to be able to enable their made-to-order process. In that example, keeping with principles of Made in China 2025, we have applied information management software in concert with the basic control equipment, to be able to provide a higher level of productivity and decision-making support. What\\'s your take on the view that automation leads to job losses instead of creating the much-needed new jobs? In today\\'s worldwide competitive economy, manufacturers that want to remain relevant have to find ways to become more productive - there\\'s no alternative. Today, for traditional manufacturing, for every direct manufacturing job there\\'s estimated to be another half a job required to support that process. In smart manufacturing, the multiplier of additional jobs created is three or four additional indirect jobs that support that basic process. So, while there may be some reduction of the repetitive traditional labor on a factory floor, the overall employment for the most competitive manufacturers will actually go up because of those additional indirect jobs, and also because they themselves will be taking additional market share. How can automation solutions help Chinese manufacturers build up their overseas footprint? Rockwell Automation can provide several valuable services and solutions in working with these manufacturers investing overseas that are facing various challenges, including regulation and standards - for example, introducing those manufacturers to our global partners, and conducting assessments of the readiness of the Chinese product in Chinese manufacturing operations for a given market, such as safety assessments to see if a given machinery will comply with the relevant country\\'s standards. We can also enforce worldwide standards across multiple countries. Have any Chinese manufacturers benefited from these solutions? One example that I can provide is of a very large Chinese tire manufacturer that wants to establish a plant in the United States. We were able to work with that manufacturer to understand their requirements, because we\\'ve worked with them in China to introduce them to local sources of value in the state that they were moving to, and also to help acquaint them with some recent advances in tire-making information systems that they\\'ll apply to their new process. How does Rockwell Automation seize the opportunities arising from smart manufacturing in China? The rise of the middle class and the demand for additional consumer products will drive a lot of our growth. The whole class of products that we refer to as consumer products is a very important focus area for the company for that very reason - the increasing numbers of people that fit that classification, such as automobile buyers. Our capabilities for adding information management systems on top of basic control, such as serialization and track-and-trace capabilities, will be particularly important in the future to meet demands for flexibility, speed and quality. We\\'re working with not just consumer-based product companies like food and beverage and where we\\'re really strong like auto and tire, but we\\'re also working with companies that make doors for the metro and rail industry to help them integrate MES (manufacturing execution systems) in their facilities. What\\'s your client portfolio in the China market? How do you localize your business in China? China is the second-largest country market for Rockwell Automation. Over the last five to 10 years, we\\'ve transitioned from where our business was 30 percent domestic and 70 percent multinational, to the current position with 70 percent of our business coming from domestic customers and 30 percent from MNCs. We have double-digit market share in terms of programmable controllers. In general, our market share positions are highest in the consumer and automotive and tire industries. What are the latest requirements and demands you have heard from your clients\\' feedback? One is to be able to continue to improve the output and the efficiency of those machines even after the initial machinery is delivered. It is a new concept to be able to provide upgrades to that equipment, to be able to improve its effectiveness even after the initial delivery. And that\\'s something we\\'re helping equipment manufacturers provide today. Another is the ability to remotely monitor that equipment. So, to be able to reduce the amount of labor that is on the site physically, you have to have a deep understanding of the machinery. The use of remote monitoring techniques is becoming important in all industries that we serve. What\\'s your leadership style? What is your mantra? It\\'s results-oriented. I like to create simple plans and assemble a team of capable, empowered people who can execute on those plans. wuyiyao@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/30/2016 page31)'],\n",

WeWork received $430 million in funding from China\\'s Legend Holdings. The latter\\'s private equity arm, Hony Capital, valued WeWork at more than $15 billion (14.4 billion euros; 12.3 billion). WeWork has opened two co-work sites in Shanghai and is preparing to launch a third one now. It\\'s also expanding to Beijing. Mao Daqing, founder of UR Work, said his co-work space brand aims to increase the number of sites from 40 across 10 cities by year\\'s end to 60 in 2017. Naked Hub announced in late November that it will accelerate its regional expansion and enhance its property resources via Gaw Capital Partners, aiming to add up to 30 new locations, or about 150,000 square meters and 30,000 members across the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and other key cities in Asia. A research note from CBRE on innovative sectors\\' leasing trends said that China\\'s small enterprises and startups are favoring co-work spaces because their cost is lower and their atmosphere appeals to young talent, particularly those working in the technology, media and telecommunications space. Sam Xie, research director of CBRE China, says innovative talent tends to work at sites in convenient locations. And when they work together, they can form a potent cluster. \"Co-work spaces are meeting these demands, so they are increasingly favored,\" Xie says. Tenants have other considerations too, real estate agents say. Says Feng Yunxi, a real estate agent with Shanghai-based Fengxiang Real Estate Co: \"Innovation and entrepreneurship have become a national aspiration. An increasing number of startups are emerging. All of them need a decent space to operate from. They can actually work from their homes or even rented residential flats to save on costs. \"But they are looking for a community, where they can feel that they are not alone; where they can get resources, such as business opportunities from other tenants, on a short-term lease basis. That\\'s so because startups do realize there\\'s no certainty they will survive in the long run and thrive. If they do, they may need to move to a larger office.\" That would be a risk though, from the space provider\\'s perspective. Whether tenants\\' businesses succeed or fail, they will likely move out eventually, leaving the office desks empty. So operators are evolving new strategies to make their own business viable in the long run. In addition to startups and freelancers, mid-sized and large enterprises are also being courted by co-work site operators. \"Co-work spaces may no longer be an exclusive zone for small businesses. Operators\\' huge investments need a stable turnover. So, a balanced tenant portfolio becomes necessary to hedge risks,\" says Kenneth Rhee, CEO of Huhan Business Advisory (Shanghai). \"In the US where co-work spaces first emerged, and in Hong Kong, where co-work spaces are common, bigger businesses such as banks and technology companies have moved some of their teams to co-work spaces. \"The younger generation among their staff prefer the atmosphere, and some creative arms of established businesses may not find a fixed seat comfortable and suitable. I think in the Chinese mainland, more co-work spaces will allocate more resources to bigger tenants in the future.\" wuyiyao@chinadaily.com.cn     - Startup entrepreneurs work in a incubator office in Liaocheng, Shandong province.

Fast-growing emerging industries have become strong drivers of China\\'s overall economic growth, particularly after regulators, policy-makers and market players expressed clear views on reform and transformation. Also, the central government mapped out growth guidelines for 2017 in early December.   - An investor appears unimpressed by the gap between his expectations and actual stock prices at a brokerage in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, on Dec 19, when the Shanghai Composite Index closed almost flat. Xing Qu / For China Daily  \"Monetary policy is officially set to be prudent and neutral in 2017. Fiscal policy will not only remain aggressive but also become more forceful and effective,\" says Xing Dongchen, chief economist at BNP Paribas. \"While limited in breakthroughs regarding SOE reform, central economic policy is committed to improving private property protection and increasing the government\\'s creditworthiness, in order to regain private investor confidence and business enthusiasm.\" The profitability of companies has been recovering based on their performance in the last quarter of 2016. While emerging industries\\' growth has been accelerating, reforms of state-owned enterprises and \"supply-side reform\" measures have had evident impact on traditional industries such as coal mining and steel-making, which have achieved capacity reductions and a recovery in net profits, according to Xun Yugen, an analyst at Haitong Securities. \"It is estimated that the consumption, healthcare, information technology and telecommunications industries can maintain net profit growth of 25 percent year-on-year, and traditional industries, including energy and raw materials, can grow their profits at somewhere between 20 and 25 percent,\" Xun says. \"The overall A-share market\\'s net profit growth is estimated at 8 percent year-on-year at the end of 2017, putting an end to a four-year-long correction.\" Listed companies will also see better liquidity because their debt service cycle is approaching the end, and another round of financing and capital expansion may start early in 2017, according to Dai Kang, an analyst at Huatai Securities. \"Companies\\' incentives for inventory replenishment and investment are rising as fundamentals are recovering to a much better level than that at the beginning of 2016. These fundamentals are likely to support companies\\' profitability growth in the next 12 months,\" Dai said. Companies focusing on consumption-driven businesses (foods and beverages, healthcare and medical services), pan-entertainment sectors (sports, media, and filmmaking) and the hospitality sector (restaurants, hotels and commercial real estate development) are likely to see robust growth in revenues and profits, according to a research note from Guosen Securities. In 2017, institutional investors will play a bigger role in the A-share market since pension funds are expected to be allowed to enter. \"Institutional investors usually attach more importance to fundamentals and long-term value. They play the role of an anchor, bringing more stability to the market and requiring more transparency and better regulations, such as disclosure and compliance efforts,\" said Cao Jianfei, chairman of Yuanshi Asset. \"This will benefit the A-share market in the long run and will, in the short term, boost blue-chip stocks, which are undervalued.\" wuyiyao@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/30/2016 page26)'],\n",
       " ['Chinese business school spreads its global perspective nan The Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business is expanding into Europe to offer a Chinese market perspective to global executives at a time when the country\\'s economy is increasingly engaging in the international business environment. The school has been testing the European waters since it held a weeklong executive training program in the UK and Switzerland in 2012. It is now into the second year of offering a full dual degree executive MBA. \"With China\\'s WTO accession, there is a need for China to have more global companies,\" says Xiang Bing, founding dean and professor of China business and globalization at CKGSB, speaking of the World Trade Organization. In Xiang\\'s view, it was precisely this need to help Chinese businesses successfully become global players, and to document their global expansion in academic research, that drove CKGSB\\'s internationalization.  - European executives who are Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business students are on a learning trip in Beijing. Provided to China Daily  The rise of the Chinese economy and desire of Western businesses to expand into China offers opportunities for business schools such as CKGSB to offer Chinese insights to Western companies. \"For China\\'s economy to become truly global China will need to have its own version of IBM, GE, Siemens and HSBC,\" says Xiang. \"Truly global companies from China will become one of the key forces of change; therefore, introducing a global perspective to Chinese entrepreneurs is important.\" Xiang says CKGSB\\'s strategy starts with creating a 40-member full-time faculty with extensive overseas teaching and research experience. The school then needs to form a global network with other universities to create knowledge-sharing and exchange platforms. Its international partners include Switzerland\\'s IMD Business School in Lausanne, Harvard\\'s Kennedy School, the Columbia Business School and National University of Singapore. The school aims to send students abroad for short-term learning programs to give them firsthand learning from international universities and the business world.  Established in 2002 with the financial backing of the Li Ka Shing Foundation, CKGSB prides itself on teaching China\\'s business elite through its Chinese EMBA programs. Xiang says internationalization has been a key focus of the school since its early days. \"When we devise our international expansion strategy, we look at which country is an important trading partner for China,\" Xiang says. CKGSB has identified the US and Europe as important areas in which to expand its footprint, given that they dominate the trading volume between China and the West. Additionally, Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea and Singapore form what Xiang terms the Confucian Economic Bloc. For this reason, CKGSB has established offices in New York,-Hong Kong-and London. \"In the coming two to three years, we will also have a focus for expansion in countries along China\\'s Belt and Road Initiative.\" The London office, established in 2011, initially focused on coordinating a three and a half day executive training program, taught at the University of Cambridge in 2012, and subsequently repeated at IMD. It brought Chinese and Western entrepreneurs into the same room to discuss preconceptions of each other\\'s culture and to correct them in order to reach a better level of understanding in the business world, according to Neil Selby, former director of executive education at CKGSB Europe. \"It is quite a shock,\" said Selby. \"And from the shock, you then build. It\\'s actually what eats away at the previous mindset you have. You probably have held that view for 20 years, and in the joint sessions you have something new.\" After preconceptions are demolished in the initial encounters, students are asked to look at case studies of Chinese and European business interactions, along with conventional course materials. The initial program at Cambridge attracted 30 European CEOs, including Tom Hunter, a well-known philanthropist who was once Scotland\\'s richest man, and Charles Aldington, former chairman of Deutsche Bank. Having successfully established its reputation in Europe, CKGSB embarked on the more ambitious project of launching a 22-month dual degree EMBA program with IMD, which includes teaching classes in London, Africa, Shanghai, Beijing and Lausanne.  Launched in 2015, the program is now in its second year. Course content includes the implications of Chinese businesses going global, the leadership of internationally recognized Chinese companies such as Baidu and Alibaba, and insights into how the Chinese state works with businesses. Xiang says one key advantage for CKGSB is the insight it offers about China, derived from its professors\\' understanding of the Chinese business environment, and their research in the country. For example, the types of competition faced by state-owned enterprises, multinationals and private businesses in China are all very different because their platforms are different. The knowledge of CKGSB\\'s professors about competition among market segments is helpful to students\\' practical understanding of doing business in China. Xiang says CKGSB\\'s innovative thinking and teaching methods are key strengths. \"I often ask my colleagues to see earth from the moon,\" he says. It\\'s an expression he uses to mean thinking outside the box. A lot of CKGSB\\'s business ideas and concepts are taught in combination with philosophy and history, so students can understand the deeper meanings behind business concepts. In addition, Xiang says the high proportion of company CEOs and chairmen among its students makes the school unique as other business schools mostly focus on younger students and junior executives. More than 50 percent of CKGSB\\'s 10,000 alumni are CEOs and chairmen of companies that accounted for 17 percent of China\\'s GDP in 2015. \"Today there are so many fast technological, social and geopolitical changes that I think there is a greater need for chairmen and CEOs to come back to the classroom to study,\" he says. CKGSB has been praised by global business leaders, including HSBC Group Chairman Douglas Flint and Alibaba founder Jack Ma. \"It has brought a holistic view of understanding business, combining education with integrity, and value systems that are, I think, the foundation of the successful businessmen of the future,\" Flint says. Ma praised the effort: \"It is a daunting challenge for a business school to bring so many truly A-list business leaders together, but CKGSB has managed to hit another home run.\" Looking into the future, Xiang is optimistic about CKGSB\\'s European expansion, believing in a solid growing market for foreign executives to learn about China, and Chinese executives studying in Europe. In addition, as China\\'s economy continues to mature and become closer in structure and characteristics to European economies, Chinese executives can learn more lessons from Europe - as in, for example, how to improve social welfare programs. \"Economically we are doing well, but in social programs we are falling behind,\" Xiang says. \"There is so much to learn from Europe, not just as a source of great technology and brands, and civilization and mobility, but also social programs. We place great emphasis on Europe as a source of learning.\" cecily.liu@mail.chinadailyuk.com (China Daily European Weekly 12/30/2016 page29)'],\n",

       " ['WeChat calls beat telecom companies nan WeChat has eclipsed telecom carriers to become the first choice for Chinese people to make calls, a study has found. The 768 million active WeChat users - more than double the entire population of the United States - made more than 100 million voice and video calls everyday via the app in 2016, its developer Tencent Group Holdings Ltd said in a report on Dec 28. With the advent of the faster 4G network and wireless connections, the figure was 1.8 times that of last year, the report found. A typical WeChat user - defined by Tencent as in his or her 20s and 30s - spent on average 65 minutes per month on WeChat-enabled calls. That further squeezed margins for telecom operators as they worry about a dent in their revenue, the study said. The country\\'s biggest carrier, China Mobile Communications Corp, for example, saw its revenue from voice services fall 16.5 percent year-on-year in 2015. The report found that half of active WeChat users linger on the app for longer than 90 minutes on a daily basis. A typical user sent out 74 messages, up 67 percent from last year, contrasting with a double-digit percent drop in short message service revenue for the likes of China Mobile. Tencent\\'s all-purpose app encapsulates the functions of Facebook, Uber and PayPal, increasingly making it an essential tool for China\\'s rising middle class. New features from digital ads to digital wallet are also helping Tencent win new territory beyond its traditional stronghold, the study found. For instance, typical users spend 580 yuan ($83.4; 79.8 euros; 68) per month on distributing red packets, a play on the red envelopes traditionally used to give gifts of money during festivals in China. By doing so, Tencent is intent on cultivating customer habits to use WeChat as a payment channel and a gateway to other business scenarios it hopes to capitalize on. The report also found that China\\'s elderly people, aged 55 or older, have become the biggest beneficiaries of the app. Many leapt from the pre-web era straight to the mobile internet, skipping the personal computer altogether. Data showed they spent 17 more minutes every month in audio and video chats than their younger peers, and outperformed them in WeChat Sports, a fitness tracking function that allows motion tracking to share the number of steps users take each day. WeChat has become a lifestyle in China, as half of its users open it more than 10 times per day, according to Li Chunyan, founder of Feida Consulting. WeChat creator Zhang Xiaolong says it is set to revolutionize the app industry by introducing \"mini-apps\", which are apps that do not require installation. \"This will boost the ease of use and reliability of the app, without it becoming inconvenient in terms of storage space and clutter for the user,\" said Zhang during a recent developers\\' event in Guangzhou. The mini apps will not be accessed from WeChat, but most likely through scanning quick response or QR codes. hewei@chinadaily.com.cn   - A WeChat QR code poster in Taiyuan, Shanxi province.

       " ['TCL Corp took global strategy to heart early nan Business model was \\'just a concept\\' in the beginning, but financial crisis showed necessity of taking operations overseas While many companies think about going global only when they are strong domestically, Chinese electronics giant TCL Corp has cultivated its international DNA since it was very young. Established in 1981, TCL sells to more than 160 countries. Of its 104.6 billion yuan ($15billion; 14.4 billion euros; 12.3 billion) revenue in 2015, about 46 percent came from overseas markets. \"In two or three years, I aim to make the proportion exceed 50 percent,\" says Li Dongsheng, chairman of TCL, in an interview in Beijing during the 2016 China Entrepreneur Summit in December.   - Visitors experience the new products at TCL\\'s headquarter in Huizhou, Guangdong province. Mai Tian / For China Daily  Headquartered in Huizhou, Guangdong province, TCL started cultivating its global landscape in 1999 - and that has much to do with Li\\'s early experiences and awareness of globalization. Having graduated from South China University of Technology in 1982 with a degree in radio wireless technology, Li started working for the TTK home appliance company, the predecessor of TCL. Later he worked for three years for the Huizhou government, focusing on bringing in foreign investment. He returned to TCL in 1993. Li says that at that time China had begun to reform and open up, and Guangdong province was at the forefront, having taken big steps by bringing in many foreign companies. Li was able to participate in the creation of more than 10 large joint ventures.    \"While establishing joint ventures, I got many chances to visit foreign companies, such as Philips and Siemens, and was greatly impressed by the technology and management. I also realized that successful companies not only have success in their home countries but are usually global,\" he says. \"I then realized that if we wanted sustainable development of our business, we needed to be global.\" TCL\\'s globalization process started in late 1990s. At that time, the company still focused on processing materials supplied by foreign business people and for foreign brands. However, when the financial crisis in Southeast Asia occurred around 1997, TCL\\'s exports were severely affected. \"For me globalization was just a concept, bringing in the experiences of overseas companies and learning from them. Good companies all have global business,\" he says. \"But when the financial crisis came, we realized we could not achieve globalization if we relied on processing materials supplied by the foreign business people, so we decided to go overseas ourselves.\" TCL started by manufacturing recording tapes. It then expanded its business on a big scale, manufacturing telephones, TVs, mobile phones, refrigerators, washing machines, air-conditioners, home appliances and LCD panels. The company now has 82,000 employees, 23 research and development centers and 21 manufacturing bases worldwide. But the globalization process is never easy. The company made headlines when it acquired the TV business of French electronics firm Thomson SA for 230 million euros ($255 million; 196 million) in January 2004. Seven months later, it stunned the telecommunications industry by gobbling up Paris-based Alcatel Mobile Phone. However, the ambitious Chinese acquirer soon suffered indigestion. TCL ran up gigantic losses of about 2.7 billion yuan in 2005, the first time it had slipped into the red since its inception in 1981. Its overseas business did not stop sliding until 2009. Li admits that was a very difficult time, but when he recalls it he says: \"You need to be very, very consistent, however difficult it is, as long as you know you are doing the right thing.\"   - Li dongsheng, chairman of TCL. Provided to China Daily  Li says that mergers and acquisitions represent a quick way for Chinese companies to go global, because it is a way of quickly acquiring the other companies\\' market share and expertise in products and technology. \"But it poses great challenges for the management of companies, because you need to integrate your own company with a new organization and a new team. If the integration doesn\\'t go well, costs will increase, and competitiveness will be weakened,\" he says. The question is whether it is better for companies to grow via mergers and acquisitions or to expand markets by themselves, based on the industry\\'s situation, the market environment and overall ability. Li says that in the early stages, TCL\\'s relatively cheaper prices and good quality attracted overseas consumers, but it has been spending more energy on technological innovation and brand-building to strengthen its push for globalization. \"Chinese brands and products have gradually got rid of the image of being low-priced and low-quality,\" he says. \"TCL now covers a wide range of goods, with various products all under the brand of TCL that can be expensive, affordable or cheap, depending on the requirements of consumers worldwide.\" Li says that with the increasing competitiveness of China\\'s manufacturing, he believes that Chinese companies will play more important roles in the world economy. \"In certain industry sectors, Chinese companies now perform better than traditional Western brands. In the electronics industry, Chinese companies are the main manufactures of TVs, mobile phones and many household electrical appliances. This is a huge achievement,\" he says. As for different countries and markets, he says the business models should all be different. But one rule is the same: There must be different strategies; different business models based on the specific situation in different markets; and different products and services based on different consumers\\' demands in different countries. \"Moreover, you need set up business systems that fit operation in a specific country with respect to its economic environment and regulations. Then you will be able to be efficient and competitive,\" he says. For example, in the Indian market, the average size of a TV set is smaller than 32 inches. In Africa, what sells best are TV sets between 28 inches and 24 inches. For smartphones, in some countries, there is good mobile network infrastructure to support use, but in others there is no 4G internet, he says, so different products should be made to fit in with the local markets. Moreover, he added, when going global, it is important for Chinese companies to shoulder certain social responsibilities. \"It is not right to just sell your products to another country and then leave. You need to transfer your industrial abilities, technology and service expertise. While building your own business, you need to contribute to the the local economy. Bear this in mind and your globalization will see sustainable development,\" he says. Li says China\\'s Belt and Road Initiative will also be helpful for TCL\\'s globalization, noting that in the past it took 35 to 40 days to transport products from the Guangdong manufacturing center to Poland, where its center for European markets is situated. But this year, with the opening of the China Railway Express, TCL\\'s products were sent by train from Chengdu, Sichuan province, to Poland in about 10 days. \"For us, turnover efficiency is much higher and the duration of the journey has been reduced by about 25 days, which means a lot in the fast-changing electronics industry. Moreover, the cost of transport by train is cheaper than by sea, which is very helpful for us in developing European markets.\" Li says the Belt and Road Initiative will help connect many countries and regions, and TCL is considering expanding along the routes to places such as East Asia and Russia. Meanwhile, the Maritime Silk Road will also help TCL develop markets in South Asia and Europe, he says. chenyingqun@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/30/2016 page28)'],\n",

Suzhou Creek and the Huangpu River are tributaries of the metropolis\\' appeal. Suzhou Creek in particular is worth exploring. The \"mother of Shanghai\", as it\\'s also called, serves as an umbilical linking the city\\'s past and present. It snakes 17 kilometers from the Waibaidu Bridge downtown to western Shanghai\\'s outer ring road. The bridge is an icon that appears in many movies that were set in the city. Dozens of couples flock to the bridge every day for wedding photos. The \"garden bridge\", as it is also called, marks the point where Suzhou Creek begins and intersects with the Huangpu. It flashes with colored lights at night. The 106-meter-long bridge - the first large one built in the city - was designed by a British company and built in 1873. It no longer serves as a traffic artery - nearly 40 other bridges have been erected over the waterway. But it stands as a pedestrian corridor for tourists. It\\'s a Shanghai tradition for a grandmother to carry a 1-month-old grandchild across a bridge as a blessing to indicate that the newborn has navigated all the twists and turns so far and will be safe and happy throughout life. Suzhou Creek\\'s banks hosted the textile mills, chemical plants and factories that propelled Shanghai\\'s 1920s industrialization. They produced modernization - and pollution.By the 1930s, the water was devoid of fish and no longer suitable for taps. Things started to turn around in the 1990s. Factories were replaced by sought-after highrises. Changning district hosts a 5-km waterfront that has become a popular place to walk and sit on lawns. A boardwalk runs along both banks. As 29-year-old resident Xiao Xu puts it: \"Jogging on different sides offers different feelings.

Both Shanghai and neighboring Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces offer 144-hours visa-free to visitors. Half that can be used to explore China\\'s most metropolitan metropolis. DAY 1    The Bund The Bund is a destination in itself, worth a full day. Check into the Fairmont Peace Hotel, a historical property that dates to before World War II. It features brilliant art deco-inspired interiors that pay homage to a style of visual arts that rose to prominence in the 1930s. Then, take a stroll along Shanghai\\'s most famous tourist stretch. The waterfront area overlooks the Huangpu River and the Lujiazui skyline, which is anchored by the iconic Oriental Pearl Tower and the 632-meter-high Shanghai Tower. There\\'s no shortage of excellent dining options around the Bund. Three on the Bund is home to a number of acclaimed Western eateries, including three restaurants by culinary maestro Jean-Georges Vongerichten - Jean-Georges, Mercato and Chi Q. Relax at the Fairmont Peace Hotel\\'s jazz bar on the ground level, where the city\\'s most-renowned and oldest jazz musicians - they average about 80 years old - demonstrate that age is just a number. A short walk from the hotel, The Nest offers a variety of nightcap options and an impressive selection of sophisticated bar bites. DAY 2    Meat-and-soup-filled dumplings No trip to Shanghai would be complete without sampling xiaolongbao, the quintessential local snack. Jia Jia Tang Bao is arguably the city\\'s most renowned hole-in-the-wall institution for this soup dumpling. Another beloved Shanghainese snack is the shengjianbao. Like xiaolongbao, it also has a delicious broth, but it\\'s considerably larger, has a thicker skin and is pan-fried instead of steamed. Locals swear by those made at Fengyu, which has multiple stores across the city. Shanghai Old Town Admire architecture that dates back to dynastic rule in Shanghai Old Town, between Remin Road and Zhongshan Road. You\\'ll also find street vendors selling snacks, souvenirs and antiques. Have lunch at Jian Guo 328, a popular Shanghainese dining establishment that serves hearty home-cooked fare at very affordable prices. If Shanghainese cuisine is too sweet for your liking, head to Canton 8, which was crowned in 2016 as the world\\'s cheapest restaurant with two Michelin stars. The establishment serves Cantonese cuisine and a sumptuous dim sum spread. Fuxing Park Get a glimpse into the daily lives of Shanghai residents at Fuxing Park. This manicured green space hosts tai chi practitioners, dancing middle-aged women and old men chatting with cigarettes in one hand and bird cages in the other. Hairy crabs are a must-try Shanghai delicacy. Xin Guang Jiu Jia, where customers are spared the hassle of dissecting the crustaceans, is celebrated. Cooks separate the flesh and roe for customers. Massage Enjoy a soothing foot massage at Taipan Massage, where the service is complemented by a free flow of beverages and small servings of noodles. Noodles A nameless, hole-in-the-wall noodle joint at 166 Zhaozhou Road, near Ji\\'nan Road, offers an utterly local dining experience. Featured in Anthony Bourdain\\'s Parts Unknown travel-and-food TV series, the \"long leg\" noodles here come with pork, lard, soy sauce, vegetables and a delectable broth. DAY 3    Breakfast Green eggs and ham come on a sandwich at Madison Kitchen, which also offers roast beef sandwiches and peanut butter-and-almond cookies. Art museum Take a tour of the Shanghai Museum of Contemporary Art. Designed by the acclaimed local company Atelier Liu Yuyang Architects, the museum features a surreal mix of contemporary Chinese and international works. Sightseeing tunnel Hop onto a tram at the Shanghai Bund Sightseeing Tunnel that takes you under the Huangpu River to Lujiazui. The experience is admittedly a little kitschy, but there\\'s no doubt that the psychedelic lighting makes for great photographs. Admire the breathtaking cityscape from the observation deck on the 119th floor of Shanghai Tower, the second-tallest building in the world after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Nightcap Round off your last night with a nightcap at Speak Low, which came in second in the inaugural 2016 Asia\\'s 50 Best Bars. Helmed by Japanese cocktail veteran Shingo Gokan, it offers creatively crafted tipples in cozy surrounds. alywin@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/30/2016 page20)'],\n",
       " ['Changing the subject nan A wise man said the only certainties in life are death and taxes. Everything else is in continuous motion, so you might as well enjoy the ride Once upon a time, there was an old man who lived at the foot of two mountains. He hated the mountains for blocking his way and decided to move them one bucket at a time. Determined, the man devoted his life to the effort. In the end, God decided to move the mountains for him. Imagine how easy a task (and how short a story) it would have been if the man had simply moved his house. There are many similar stories in Chinese mythology where humanity triumphs over nature.

       " ['Timeless Chinese BBQ nan Editor\\'s note: To understand China, sit down to eat. Food is the indestructible bond that holds the whole social fabric together and it is also one of the last strong visages of community and culture. In virtually any Chinatown in the world, barbecued duck, chicken and pork are a standard sight, hanging on hooks behind glass counters - effective advertising to attract meat lovers of all nationalities. It works like magic. Unexpected guests for dinner? Run down to the Chinese barbecue and get a roast duck. The chef will even chop it up for you, ready to go on the plate once you reach home. Or ask for a mixed platter for a savory variety. Solitary and hungry for lunch or dinner? Rice and noodles are staples, topped by your choice of meat, from a roast duck drumstick to maybe a row of neatly slivered barbecued pork loin. The barbecue chef will even throw in a salad of cucumber, cilantro, tomato, and pickled radishes and carrots.   - Soy sauce chicken is made from organic chicken that is repeatedly dunked into a boiling soy sauce marinade until the bird is just cooked and still slightly pink at the bone. Photos by To Chee Kan / For China Daily   - The perfect bowl of won-ton noodles must have egg noodles cooked al dente and dumplings that float like clouds in the tasty soup.   Such is the universal appeal of Chinese barbecue worldwide that it is often the first introduction to Chinese food, followed probably by dim sum, the snacks-on-trolleys at Chinatown restaurants. We owe this to the first emigrants from southern China, the Cantonese, whose legacy was further reinforced later by a second diaspora of chefs from Hong Kong in the mid-1990s. It\\'s still the Hong Kong chefs who do barbecue best, having the advantage of a sophisticated, appreciative audience and access to the best ingredients. Where else would you find them making char siew from the best Kurobuta pork? Let\\'s take a tour of the Chinese barbecue counter. First there will be several kind of birds hanging whole, ready to be cut up and served as orders come in. There will be whole roast geese, distinguishable from ducks by their longer necks, larger bodies and a fatty hump at the top of their heads. There are ducks, of course, skins crisp and burnished a beautiful red-bronze by a maltose glaze, slow roasting over an open fire. Often, there are whole chickens - braised, not roasted, and succulent at every bite, their skin saturated by a fragrant soy sauce marinade kicked up a notch by Chinese rice wine. Whole slabs of belly pork are salted, seasoned with five-spice powder and roasted until their skins puff up. The siew yuk or shaorou is a delicious masterpiece with distinct layers of lean meat and fat topped by an exquisite square of crisp crackling. Char siew is the name for honeyed strips of barbecued pork fillets, which are often the most popular. Whereas the roast duck, the braised soy chicken and even the crackling-topped belly pork are pretty specific in their use of ingredients, barbecue chefs in Hong Kong and Guangdong have exercised the most creativity in making char siew. Traditionally, the recipe calls for a loin fillet that is marinated in a thick soybean paste, maltose or honey-and-soy sauce. The strips of meat are then hung and baked in a drum oven until the fatty edges crisp or even blacken. The burnt ends are very popular with children. Modern-day chefs are catering to changing tastes.    At one time, pale pink and generously marbled pork cheeks were used to make char siew. The result was an incredibly tender piece of meat that almost melts in the mouth. This is still my favorite cut of meat. The trend these days is to offer two types of char siew, a fatty version and a healthier alternative. The fatty char siew is made with meat just bordering the belly, with enough marbling to ensure tenderness and some visible fat on the edges that crisp up for a flavor contrast. Perhaps this is a knee-jerk reaction to the health fads that have cut a swath across the food and beverage industry. Chinese barbecue is also famous for its accompanying sauces and garnishes. For roast goose and duck, there is always a hot, dark chili oil and a sweet-and-sour thick plum sauce, both designed to cut the grease. In the past, every order of roasted bird came with a shallow pool of duck or goose juices and several spoonfuls of candied whole soybeans braised in licorice bark and soy sauce. The soy-braised chicken, however, comes with a sauce of pulverized spring onions and ginger scalded in sesame oil. Salads of sliced cucumbers and tomatoes, pickled radishes and carrots are all part of the mise-en-place. And, you can order rice or noodles to go with your barbecue, always with a thoughtful ladle of sauce drizzled over them. Restaurant dishes follow trends and consumer fads, but if ever there is an evergreen, it must be the time-tested Chinese barbecue. paulined@chinadaily.com.cn Grassroots favorites earn Michelin stars When the famed Michelin Guide to good food first entered China, it zoomed in on Hong Kong, where food is a major attraction for both tourists and locals. It also wisely took to the streets instead of confining its critiques to posh restaurants. So it was that a hole-in-the-wall dim sum shop got its one Michelin star, and a Chinese barbecue stall run by three generations of chefs was awarded another. The dim sum outfit is Tim Ho Wan, and the Chinese barbecue is Kam\\'s Roasts - both of which have been successfully franchised and exported to other countries, such as Singapore. The master franchisee is none other than Robert Chua, the legendary broadcaster who turned the Chinese variety show Enjoy Yourself Tonight into a launchpad for countless Hong Kong television celebrities. In his second career as he tops 70, Robert Chua is powering his way forward in the food and beverage industry. Television and food are not much different, he says. They are both people industries. \"You must give them a good product, honest hard work and thoughtful service,\" he says. Needless to say, you also need an excellent entrepreneurial sense and people skills to persuade the owners of Tim Ho Wan and Kam\\'s Roasts to hand over the franchises. When we visited his restaurant, Chua did not say much but he was certainly doing a lot. As Kam\\'s executive chef, Wong Kwan Seng, says, Chua is a tireless dynamo, personally overseeing the staff, greeting customers, introducing the menu and even clearing the tables after the diners have finished. Seven decades old, he still sets an example that shames those much younger. And that\\'s why I have no doubt that a Kam\\'s Roasts will soon come to a location near you.

       " ['Ethnic art inspires high fashion nan Chinese brands draw inspiration from Miao ethnic traditions, adding flair to products while helping the old ways to survive Tucked away in the mountains, Jidao village is a three-hour drive from Guiyang, capital of Guizhou province. Here, the ethnic Miao people maintain their traditional lifestyle, living in wooden houses, preserving meat in early winter and holding gatherings at the riverside to remember their ancestors. All this might seem to have no connection with high fashion, but the community has been a source of inspiration for many designers and fashion houses, including fashion brand Eve.     - Eve models show off the brand\\'s new collections, which use embroidery patterns inspired by the ethnic Miao in Jidao village, Guizhou province. Photos Provided to China Daily   The Chinese brand recently made a trip to the village for an advertising campaign for its 2017 spring and summer collection, which features Miao-style embroidery. Inspired by the sea, the collection features shades of blue on suits, sweaters and coats. A smattering of embroidery adorns the classic suit silhouette. The women\\'s collection includes sleek qipao - a traditional Chinese women\\'s dress - along with dresses that highlight nature-inspired embroidery. While traditional Miao embroidery is intricate, Wu Chaohui, creative director of Eve\\'s menswear line, says the brand has simplified it to cater to customers\\' modern-day needs. \"Traditional Miao embroidery is usually very rich and ornate, while modern menswear is understated. So we try to use it in a selective, moderate way,\" he says. \"We want to revive this heritage by offering it to an urban clientele, and we hope this tradition will live on.\" Eve has been working on a project to preserve Miao embroidery over the past 15 years with a dedicated team that documents the traditional crafts. It has established a network of craftspeople and their work, which has been used extensively in their collections and shown at exhibitions and in runway shows in Milan, London and Paris in recent years. Separately, Eve has also formed an alliance with local brands, so that all its members can make use of the database.    In a related development, it helped build a museum in Guizhou to exhibit the works of the embroiderers. Xia Hua, founder and chairwoman of the Eve Group, says, \"These people are preserving their heritage with their hands. I want to share their craftsmanship with the world and let it see the beauty of our country.\" Xia was a teacher at China University of Political Science and Law before founding the Eve Group in 1994. Eve is best known for making men\\'s suits, and has dressed such Chinese magnates as Jack Ma and Liu Chuanzhi. The company now has five brands - Eve de Uomo, Notting Hill, Kevin Kelly, Jaques Pritt and Eve Cina. The prices of its outfits range from a few hundred to more than 10,000 yuan ($1,440; 1,380 euros; 51,175). The group currently has more than 500 stores in China, including a designer space in Beijing\\'s Parkview Green mall that showcases its collaborations with international and local designers. The growing interest in Miao ethnic culture is also changing the lives of villagers. In Jidao village, embroiderers now hold workshops to teach children the craft. There are about 50 embroiderers in the village, with the oldest more than 80. For overseas exposure, the embroiderers were taken by Chinese designer Xie Feng to Paris Fashion Week in 2012 to exhibit their skills. As their craftsmanship has gained more exposure over the years, orders have flooded in. Now, looking to secure their future, the embroiderers have created a foundation to which they contribute 3 percent of their revenues. Its assets now total around 6,000 yuan, which they intend to use to promote their art, says Chen Qin, an embroiderer and a foundation organizer. \"It is like a seed.

Ministry spokesman Shen Danyang told a news conference in Beijing that the authorities are encouraging companies to continue to expand and operate internationally. \"At the same time, we need to put a cap on irrational outbound investment in real estate, hotels, entertainment and sports to guard against risks,\" Shen said. He said that special attention needed to be paid to companies making large-scale investments in fields outside their main business, companies of limited partnership and companies investing in overseas projects that are bigger than the mother company itself. China\\'s overseas direct investment in the first 11 months stood at $161.7 billion (154.86 billion euros; 132.08 billion), up 55.3 percent year-on-year. That growth rate is three times higher than for the same period last year. The ministry did not elaborate on the rate the country\\'s outbound investments are predicted to grow in 2017. Some of the biggest investments in the current year included Wanda Group\\'s purchase of US movie making company Legendary Pictures at $3.5 billion, Midea Group\\'s takeover of German robot manufacturing company KUKA at $5 billion, and Anbang Insurance Group\\'s acquisition of a luxury housing project from the Black Stone Group for $6.5 billion. Four government departments - the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Commerce, the People\\'s Bank of China and State Administration of Foreign Exchange - have recently made joint remarks about tightening irrational investment overseas. Fu Hongyu, deputy director of the research center of domestic and overseas financial law at Beijing Foreign Studies University, says that on one hand investment in infrastructure construction - particularly in the Belt and Road Initiative region - is to be encouraged. On the other hand, he adds, investments in areas where hot money and speculation thrive will be subjected to stricter review. \"Management of industries such as hotels, entertainment and sports is complicated because it is easy to rig the taxes and statistics, which makes them ideal channels for money laundering,\" Fu says. yangziman@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/30/2016 page15)'],\n",

Previously known as the J-31, the twin-engine, radar-evading aircraft is still under development by Shenyang Aircraft Corp, part of the Aviation Industry Corp of China. The test flight of the latest prototype took place on Dec 23 at Shenyang Aircraft Corp, four years after the first one took to the skies, sources say. Aviation enthusiasts posted pictures on Chinese websites, showing what they said was the second prototype in flight. A publicity officer at AVIC who declined to be named confirmed the flight test but said he was not authorized to disclose details. The FC-31 was unveiled in October 2012, when the first prototype took to the air, becoming the country\\'s second fifth-generation fighter jet following the J-20, which had its first flight in January 2011. Deliveries of J-20s to the People\\'s Liberation Army Air Force have begun. Fifth-generation fighters are the most advanced available.    The new FC-31 seems to have better stealth capabilities, improved electronic equipment and a larger payload capacity, says Wu Peixin, an aviation industry observer in Beijing. \"Compared with the first FC-31, there are a lot of improvements on the second prototype. Changes were made to the airframe, wings and vertical tails, which make it leaner, lighter and more maneuverable,\" he says. Fu Qianshao, an aircraft expert with the PLA Air Force, says the new FC-31 has state-of-the-art instruments such as its electro-optical targeting system and helmet-mounted display and sight system. He says AVIC wants to use the FC-31 to capture market share at home and abroad, but the company is making a big push to attract foreign buyers with the medium-sized stealth combat planes. \"I believe the aircraft will have bright prospects in the market. Based on my experience and knowledge, I presume its price will be around $70 million (67 million euros; 57 million), about half that of the United States\\' Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II,\" he says. \"Moreover, the fourth-generation Eurofighter Typhoon and Dassault Rafale fighter jets are priced at about $100 million. All of these mean you can spend a lot less money to get an advanced, fifth-generation stealth combat plane.\" Li Yuhai, deputy general manager of AVIC, has previously said AVIC plans to use the FC-31 to \"put an end to some nations\\' monopolies on the fifth-generation fighter jet\". This plane \"is able to compete with any other aircraft of its kind\", Li says. The only fifth-generation fighter jet currently available in the market is the US F-35 Lightning II, but the US sells it only to allies. AVIC displayed a large-scale model of the FC-31 at the 14th Dubai Airshow in the United Arab Emirates in November 2015. Specifications supplied by AVIC reveal a maximum takeoff weight of 28 metric tons, a flight radius of 1,250 kilometers and a top speed of Mach 1.8, or 1.8 times the speed of sound. It can carry 8 tons of weapons. The plane can hold six missiles in its internal weapons bay and another six under its wings. zhaolei@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/30/2016 page14)'],\n",

It also marks Yunnan province\\'s entry into the nation\\'s high-speed railway network. The new lines link its capital, Kunming, with Shanghai and Guangzhou. Twenty-nine of 31 provincial-level regions on the Chinese mainland are now served by high-speed railways, excluding only the Tibet and Ningxia autonomous regions.

It\\'s the nation\\'s longest east-west high-speed railway. Trains run from 300 to 350 kilometers per hour, depending on topography. The new Kunming-Guangzhou line cuts travel time from 16 and 30 minutes to 8 hours and 52 minutes, running at 200 to 250 km/h. A high-speed grid of four north-south lines and four east-west lines is taking shape. In 2008, China set a target to build the grid by 2020. Only two sections have not opened yet, the Jinan-Shijiazhuang and Baoji-Lanzhou lines. \"The two new high-speed lines and the newly opened transportation hub at Kunming South Railway Station are important basic infrastructure to link with neighboring countries in South Asia and Southeast Asia,\" China Railway Corp said in a statement. The system also aims to help eradicate poverty by transforming the high-speed rail industry into an economic driving force. Peng Wan, a 28-year-old train fan from Kunming, took a day off work on Dec 28 to catch the first bullet train departure from his hometown. \"In the early 1990s, I took a train from Kunming to Guiyang for the first time.

The law will take effect on July 1. \"It is a milestone for TCM development as it\\'s recognized by law,\" Wang Guoqiang, head of the State Administration of TCM, said at a news conference on Dec 25. The law is also an indication of public demand and expectations for TCM, which has proved effective but at times cannot be easily defined or regulated by mainstream Western medical approaches, he said.   - Employees work at a traditional Chinese medicine shop in Zhengzhou, Henan province. China\\'s first law covering traditional Chinese medicine was passed recently and will take effect in July. Provided to China Daily  \"The adoption of the law is only a start, and more matching policies and regulations will follow in the spirit of the law boosting TCM,\" he said. TCM long ago was the only treatment available in China, but Western medicine began to dominate in modern times. In recent years, some have even called on authorities to drop TCM\\'s status as a legally accepted treatment option. The law recognizes TCM as an important part of the country\\'s healthcare system and encourages its development. It also allows it to be managed and regulated according to its own characteristics. Unlike many doctors of Western medicine, some TCM practitioners learned their skills from a master instead of going through a standard school education. But \"many do command great skill. The law allows them to get a license to practice TCM and go mainstream\", says Deng Yong, a researcher of law at Beijing University of Chinese Medicine. The new law stipulates that practitioners must pass exams highlighting practical skills and treatment outcomes by provincial-level TCM authorities, and obtain recommendations from two certified practitioners. That\\'s a major breakthrough as \"many competent TCM doctors work underground because they couldn\\'t pass the exams for medical doctors that focus on Western medicine or the English tests\", Deng says. The law also makes it easier to open individual practices and clinics by requiring only the filing of a record with the local health authority, instead of an approval, he added. There are 3,966 TCM hospitals and 42,528 TCM clinics across the country, with roughly 452,000 practitioners, according to a white paper on TCM issued by the State Council Information Office this month. They receive an average 910 million annual visits nationwide, it said. \"The law will help bring more competent TCM doctors to patients,\" said the TCM administration\\'s Wang. By clearly setting the boundaries of treatment, the law helps to eliminate fake TCM doctors who often boast they can cure all diseases, Deng said. \"That protects patients\\' rights and health and the reputation of TCM,\" he said. Under the law, TCM products and services can be advertised only with approval from the local TCM authority. To safeguard consumers\\' health, the law also calls for strengthened management and quality control over TCM raw materials and related procedures including raising, planting, collecting and stocking such materials. Highly toxic pesticides cannot be used to cultivate medicinal herbs. shanjuan@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/30/2016 page14)'],\n",
       " [\"Africa's open road to development nan Continent positioned to become the next major manufacturing hub in the global marketplace Our world is coming off an incredible 2016. If the United Kingdom's vote for Brexit wasn't bad enough, Donald J. Trump will be sworn as president of the United States in January. And Africa's year hasn't been so rosy either. From protests in Ethiopia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to deepening economic turmoil in Nigeria and South Africa, to ongoing humanitarian crises across the continent, Africa has probably more reasons to mourn than rejoice in 2016. Yet there may be a glimmer of hope. Key stepping stones on Africa's path to industrialization were laid firmly in 2016, creating an important opportunity: The continent can become the next manufacturing hub for the global market.       The Made in Africa Initiative aims to help the continent seize the opportunity for industrialization arising from the pending relocation of light manufacturing from China and other developing market economies. By capturing this opportunity, Africa will achieve sustainable, dynamic and inclusive growth. However, today's Africa faces serious challenges. What Africa needs now are success stories to provide the aspirations, confidence and experience necessary for it to realize its potential in terms of industrialization and shared prosperity. The Made in Africa Initiative offers a vision to create success in African countries. The opportunities Modern economic growth, highlighted by a continuous rise in a country's per capita income, is a process of ever-increasing labor productivity. Making this process possible are continuous structural transformations in technologies and industries - to reduce the factor costs of production and increase output values; and in infrastructure and institutions to reduce transaction costs and risks. Why have African countries failed to prosper? Because they have not transformed their economic structures from agriculture and mining to modern industry. However, from our perspective, poverty and backwardness is not destiny for African countries. The future can change if Africa seizes the golden opportunity of industrialization. The developed high-income countries of Europe and North America all started to transform their humble, premodern agrarian economies by developing light manufacturing. The few economies in East Asia catching up to the developed countries after World War II jump-started their industrialization by entering light manufacturing because of rising wages in the higher-income countries. Consider the relocations from the United States to Japan in the 1950s, from Japan to the four Asian Tigers - Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and South Korea - in the 1960s, and from the four Asian Tigers to the Chinese mainland in the 1980s. China is now at a stage - like that of Japan in the 1960s and the Four Tigers in the 1980s - to begin relocating its light manufacturing to other countries because of its rapidly rising labor costs. Growth in China and in other emerging market economies, such as India and Brazil, will again provide opportunities for other developing countries to jump-start their industrialization. Africa is potentially an attractive destination for the relocation of light manufacturing from China and other developing market economies. Africa has an abundant supply of young labor. It is close to European and the US markets. And it has zero tariffs on its exports, thanks to the Africa Growth Opportunity Act in the US and the EU's Everything But Arms policy. The Made in Africa Initiative aims to help Africa exploit this window of opportunity to become the world's next manufacturing hub and to achieve dynamic, sustainable and inclusive growth. The challenges To capture this opportunity, African countries faces several challenges that needs to be tackled in the near future: Lack of technological know-how - how to produce high-quality goods at a competitive price in the global market by using abundant labor and other resources. Lack of confidence by international buyers in the ability of African manufacturers to deliver goods on time and with the consistent quality specified in contracts. Lack of infrastructure and a business environment to reduce the transaction costs in reaching international markets. How can an African country best overcome these challenges? First, the government must adopt an active investment promotion strategy to attract existing export-oriented light manufacturing companies that have the technological know-how and enjoy the confidence of international buyers in China and other emerging market economies. Second, governments must use their limited resources and implementation capacity strategically to establish industrial parks and special economic zones with adequate infrastructure and a good business environment to help investors reduce their transaction costs. A new mission The Made in Africa Initiative will help African countries generate quick successes in export-oriented light manufacturing through a strategy that includes the following: Bridging the information gap to help export-oriented light manufacturing enterprises in China and other emerging market economies understand Africa's advantages and set up production there. Engaging with stakeholders and connecting with policymakers, development agencies, businesses communities and other key parties, globally, regionally and nationally, to share the vision and the approach for capturing Africa's window of opportunity to industrialize. Advocating triangular collaboration to connect the dots. Advocate win-win cooperation between African countries and prospective investors, such as international retailers in Europe and the US, presenting the comparative advantages in abundant supplies of labor and raw materials. Working with international organizations and world leaders in the global supply chain to connect the dots of triangular collaboration (manufacturing capability, global retail market and African comparative advantages). Supporting African countries in identifying their comparative advantages and creating their own development approach, as well as providing intellectual support to African countries to identify their sectors of comparative advantage. Sharing successes and failures of past industrialization efforts, and support African countries in developing an approach that is green, inclusive, sustainable and environmentally friendly. Working with governments, including national leaders, to build quick key success examples in industrial development. Bringing prospective investors who have the manufacturing know-how to visit African countries to facilitate early-stage investment negotiations with the government and to ensure successful investments and implementation to turn the country's opportunities into reality. Identifying policy constraints through the first movers' operations, and advising the government on further reforms to attract more international and domestic manufacturing investment. Africa's future As we believe that the best way to develop a country's economy is to upgrade and diversify its industries by clearly identifying its latent comparative advantages, we see more African countries recognizing the right path to industrialization. More important, Africa's future prosperity can be foreseen. The efforts of the global community of nations and a private sector committed to supporting African industrialization will promote production capacity cooperation and achieve sustainable development goals through the application of top-level technical expertise and other available tools.

       " ['2017 will be the Year of Chinese Consumers nan Increasingly prosperous spenders will become an important driving force for businesses at home and throughout the world In the past one or two years, Chinese consumers have arrived as a significant economic force. They have become a real driver of China\\'s GDP growth. Their spending is fueling local companies and minting millionaire and billionaire entrepreneurs. And they have become a significant part of business in markets around the world. But this is just the beginning. In fact, what we have been seeing is just the laying of the foundation for the eventual impact of Chinese consumers on the world. I believe their real impact will begin to show itself in 2017, which will be the Year of the Chinese Consumer. Here are my predictions: 1. Chinese and foreign businesses will increasingly follow Chinese consumers around the world. Last year over 110 million Chinese tourists flew outbound into the world. More than half of all tourists in Asia were from China. An estimated 950,000 Chinese tourists visited New York City in 2016, up 700 percent from 2007. The favorite destination, Thailand, received around 8 million Chinese tourists. While this large outbound migration initially caused some friction with local cultures - resulting in some humorous stories and occasional blacklistings - international Chinese tourists have matured. They are now more sophisticated and experienced international consumers.    In short, the Chinese tourism phenomenon has matured and has become routine. As a result, businesses everywhere are now investing and making strategic decisions based on this now stable economic phenomenon. And that is what I predict we are going to see in 2017 lots of businesses making increasingly significant investments to support and service Chinese international tourists as a permanent fixture of the global economy. One example of this is that Chinese companies are now going international to follow their Chinese customers. While Chinese CEOs have for a long time expressed their intention to go global, this has largely not happened. With the exception of Huawei and a few others in the natural resources and infrastructure sectors, most Chinese companies have remained focused on winning in China. And many of their international moves, such as technology, brand and natural resource acquisitions, were really about competing more effectively back in China. This is now finally changing. Chinese companies are seeing their customers traveling abroad in large numbers, and they know if they don\\'t continue to serve them overseas then someone else will. Chinese companies are going international out of necessity. Examples of this have been accumulating recently. In November, Chinese travel platform Ctrip announced its acquisition of UK-based flight search engine Skyscanner. This will let it expand its offerings to include foreign flights. In August, Chinese taxi-hailing leader Didi Chuxing purchased Uber China and then promptly refocused on its international investments, including Indian Ola, American Lyft and SE Asian Grab. Throughout 2016, Alibaba\\'s Jack Ma has repeatedly said that 50 percent of Alibaba\\'s revenue will be international by 2025. And most recently, the Plough at Cadsden pub, where UK Prime Minister David Cameron and Chinese President Xi Jinping drank beer together, has just been purchased by a Chinese-backed SinoFortone Group. All of these international moves are about following Chinese consumers. One area where Chinese companies are going international in a particularly aggressively fashion is in payments and credit cards. In November, Ant Financial invested in Thailand\\'s Ascend Money. In September, UnionPay announced that its card is now accepted at 80 percent of US merchants and 100 percent of US ATMs. And virtually everyone from Huawei and Xiaomei to Apple is jumping into e-payments for Chinese consumers. We can see foreign companies behaving the same way. They are also investing to benefit from the emergence of more international Chinese consumers. Signs saying we accept Alipay and TenPay are now ubiquitous across Thailand. In vitro fertilization clinics in Los Angeles are building new facilities and hiring full-time Mandarin-speaking staff specifically to accommodate the influx of expectant Chinese women. And so on. Overall, in the past three years, more than 360 million Chinese consumers have traveled out of China. This now-stable economic phenomenon will increasingly influence business decision-making around the world. 2. Mobile and O2O applications will show hyper-adoption by Chinese consumers. That Chinese consumers like buying things on their phones is not news. What is going to be different in 2017 is the speed of adoption of mobile applications and services. The already fast adoption rate appears to be accelerating, including the online-to-offline, or O2O model. Mobike and Ofo are the newest examples of the hyper-adoption of mobile applications by Chinese consumers. Twelve months ago, you could find some Mobikes and Ofo bikes scattered around Beijing and Shanghai. Now they are everywhere. Shanghai, in particular, seems almost overrun with Mobikes. Yet both companies were founded less than two years ago . Chinese company Meitu, which is currently preparing for a Hong Kong IPO, offers a mobile photo editing application that lets you alter your appearance - such as making your chin narrower, your eyes larger, and so on. Its use by Chinese women who want to \"beautify\" their selfies has surged to stunning numbers. More than 440 million Chinese women are now using the application. This is remarkable growth for this kind of app. Like bicycle sharing, it serves a market that virtually nobody saw coming. On a side note, in September 2016, a woman was pulled over for drunk driving in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. After a breathalyzer confirmed intoxication, the police began taking photos for evidence. The woman then demanded that they use Meitu for their photos, so she would look better. 3. Chinese women - moms in particular - will increase their influence as consumers. I have argued that Chinese moms are the most important consumers on the planet. They typically generate 50 percent of household income in China. They were estimated by Mastercard to control over 75 percent of Chinese household spending. And they are far more attuned to health, education and safety issues, particularly regarding their one child in a country with food, water and air quality issues. They are a major force among rising Chinese consumers. I expect this to increase in 2017. First, like most Chinese consumers and households, they are increasing in wealth. This has a lot to do with the ongoing urbanization. For example, in the past three years, over 30 million people moved into Chinese cities. And by 2025, China will likely have 10 New York-size cities. So the pure number of Chinese urban households is growing - and Chinese women are still the biggest force within urban household spending. However, Chinese women themselves are also changing rapidly, not just becoming more numerous. They are getting married later, now at an average age of 27 instead of 24. They are beginning to have more children. There is now a mini baby boom following the changes to the one-child policy. They are increasingly focused on health and healthy living. They are increasingly worldly, with young women being a significant portion of Chinese tourists. All of these things, and others, are changing the lifestyles, priorities and spending habits of arguably China\\'s most important consumer demographic. This is a phenomenon to watch in 2017. 4. Increasingly emotional Chinese consumers will increasingly surprise the world. Chinese urban households have largely passed the point where they worry about paying for the necessities of life. They can now afford food, shelter, clothing and the other basic necessities. They are now focusing more on what to do with their increasing disposable income. They are thinking more about occasional luxuries, travel destinations, sports sneakers and other semi-necessities. In marketing terms, they have moved from being value consumers to mainstream consumers. Basically, they have stopped buying based mostly on what they need and are now buying more based on what they want. And \"want\" is much more about emotions, aspirations and impulses. Basically, Chinese are becoming much more emotional consumers. Given their growing impact on the world, this increasingly emotional consumer behavior is increasingly impacting other markets, often in real time. Suddenly, if Chinese consumers lose interest in buying houses in Toronto because they prefer California, Toronto\\'s housing market can take a significant hit. Suddenly, when Brexit causes the value of the pound sterling to fall versus the yuan, Chinese tourists shift their vacation plans and arrive en masse to take advantage of the increased spending power in the UK.

       " [\"Smog in the air, but green is on the horizon nan Progress is being made to ensure that environmental safeguards work, but mechanisms still need refining In one respect the year has ended much as it began in Beijing, with more of those foggy, smoggy days in which levels of PM2.5 density are much higher than they should be, forcing people to wear masks, and factories, schools and factories to be closed and flights to be cancelled. Yet Beijingers have more or less got used to this suffocating scenario. Shortly after the winter heating has been fired up in northern China in recent years, almost as if on cue smog has hit the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area, one of China's most urbanized regions with a population of more than 100 million. The government is well aware of the severity of the pollution. In 2013 the State Council set out measures in what was called Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan. Three years have passed, and the plan has had some positive effects, but there is still more work to do.    In the Fifth Plenum of the 18th Communist Party of China Central Committee last year, five core concepts for economic development were put forward and emphasized. Innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared development must be implemented to tackle the problems hindering the country so that the development target of the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016-20) can be achieved. Green development implies that we must stick to the concept of an environmentally friendly, low-carbon and circular economy and persistently follow the course of sustainable development. President Xi Jinping has repeatedly said that to keep the environment green and clean is as valuable as creating wealth, and protecting our environment is tantamount to increasing productivity. Over the past year both the central government and local governments have achieved significant successes in implementing the green development concept. In the past, despite targets related to environmental protection and green development, the absence of policy constraints and a pertinent evaluation system has offset the efficiency in realizing these targets. The blind pursuit of high economic growth at the expense of the environment still exists and the environment has in fact deteriorated in some parts of China. But in recent years the central government and provincial governments made gains in implementing green development. Such development is now regarded as a strict constraint when policies are made and executed. Government and business have also been moved to comply with the idea of green development with new incentives.    The first achievement is a closer connection of the green development concept with policy-making in development priority zones. The outline of the 13th Five-Year Plan further defined the scope of development priority zones, and it is expected that the central government will increase financial transfer payments toward key ecological functional areas soon. And obviously this will benefit the restoration of ecologically fragile areas and strengthen ecological curbs in development zones. The second achievement is reflected in a closer combination of the green development concept with industrial policies regarding cutting excess capacity. As one of the five major tasks to promote structural reform from the supply side, new policies have been introduced to cut excess production in the steel and coal industries. In defining the policy it has been made clear that all manufacturing facilities that damage the environment or pose a threat to safe production should be eliminated without hesitation. This policy sets green development as a precondition of industrial development. This in effect forces companies to give green development higher strategic significance. The closer connection between the systems under which officials are evaluated and green development is another good example. This year the reporting mechanism of provincial environmental protection departments has been transformed from territorial management to vertical management. Thus the Ministry of Environmental Protection now directly oversees provincial environmental protection department. The appointment of local environmental officials has also centralized, eliminating potential interference from local government in the enforcement of environmental protection laws. And a balance sheet of natural resources assets is being developed. All these measures will further enlarge the responsibility of the local authority in protecting natural resources, and these policy innovations will lay a solid foundation for protecting the environment. To fully implement green development in the 13th Five-Year Plan period, we must change the way we think about developing urban economies and gradually improve our planning. When I am invited to work on urban and industrial development plans in many cities, I stress that development must not be absolutely paramount, an idea that on the face of it seems to run counter to advocacy of industrial development. In fact, what it means is that we must reserve space and land in the process of urban and industrial development under the new economic norms, to grow the economy not only in scale, but also in quality. On the other hand, we must make a greater effort to formulate and implement policies with reference to our experience. I would earnestly hope that the green development concept will be regarded as a constraint in more regional policies as well as industrial policies. Given adequate policies with market-oriented incentives, people's sentiment about environmental protection will change quickly. For such policies to be effective, we should promote them in more areas and apply them to more industries after they have been improved. Eventually, we must gradually develop a series of institutions and mechanisms regarding green development that are appropriate for China and that promote its sustainable economic growth. We should better manage the incremental growth based on the current economic scale. China's economy is still growing at a considerable pace, with the target set at 6.5 percent average during the 13th Five-Year Plan period. We must prevent pollution and damage to the environment in pursing the incremental growth of the economy while encouraging the growth of green manufacturing, a low-carbon economy and environmentally friendly industries. We must also accelerate our progress in environmental governance, environmental detection and energy conservation. I firmly believe that in the 13th Five-Year Plan period, with regards to green development many more achievements lie ahead.

       " ['E-commerce holds plenty of surprises nan Entrepreneurs set to stir up online shopping sector, led by rising generation of vigorous, creative Chinese talent As we enter the new year, it is always an appropriate time to look ahead to industry developments, especially in those so-called strategic industries that are growing most quickly and significantly. Perhaps no industry can lay more claim to this \"strategic\" status than e-commerce. During 2016, global retail e-commerce sales reached an amazing $1.9 trillion (1.8 trillion euros; 1.6 trillion). Double-digit growth continued and is forecast to continue until 2020 at which time worldwide sales are estimated at a staggering $4 trillion. Key to this inexorable rise has been the parallel propulsion of the Chinese e-commerce industry, where giants such as Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent have certainly made their mark on the world stage.    One of the key consumer trends that is set to continue throughout 2017 is the preference for e-commerce engagement via mobile phone rather than personal computer. It is estimated that retailers that cannot reach consumers via mobile or tablet may be, in effect, ignoring as much as half their customer base. One such eminent e-commerce player in recent years, Alibaba, has certainly set up effective mobile engagement with its customer base. Over 85 percent of Alibaba\\'s sales during this year\\'s Singles Day were the result of transactions on mobile devices. Clearly, 2017 is a year during which websites will have to be as mobile-compatible as possible. Furthermore, a mobile-first approach appears absolutely essential when building online consumer experience. The e-commerce payment landscape could continue to change during 2017. Card payment security continues to concern many, and alternative payment methods and platforms such as Alipay, PayPal and Amazon Pay are likely to gain considerable market share. Ease of mobile payment will also become an increasingly important factor affecting online consumer decision making. Once again Chinese e-commerce players are set for further gains here with advanced payment systems. Chinese e-commerce giants Tencent (messaging app. with payment via WeChat) and Alibaba (payment via Alipay) are both perfect examples. Speed and cost of delivery will also play an increasingly important role in customer decision-making when purchasing online. Most retailers now set next-day delivery as standard. Long gone are the days where 5- to 7-day delivery was the norm. Customers demand free and increasingly rapid delivery.    We may witness a move toward same-day delivery during 2017, where retailers will work closely with their distribution partners in an attempt to hit this difficult target. Further progress toward personalizing the online shopping experience will no doubt feature in 2017. Retailers, via their online platforms, should be able to make better use of previous order patterns and additional online interaction to personalize the shopping experience. Consumer culture around the world is now characterized by a need for self-expression and, therefore, any move toward further personalization of the online experience should meet with success. In terms of the design of e-commerce sites - vitally important when attracting new potential customers - pictorial presentation appears to be the major trend. Too many words may well confuse consumers who are more interested in an emotional shopping experience and purchasing products that enhance their lifestyle emotionally too. Visual appeal and colorful images that create consumer engagement should dominate any e-commerce design/redesign. Very important, it is crucial that retailers do not forget the importance of customer service across all channels. Recently, major e-commerce players such as Ebay and Amazon have moved to work even closer with their partners in order to ensure ever-higher levels of customer service. Consumers now demand excellent service. Consumers also value stimulation and eschew any form of mundane, routine lifestyle. It is therefore expected that increasing flash sales will continue to work well. Such sales fit very well with new, unpredictable consumer lifestyles and shopping behaviors. Those e-commerce players who respond quickest to major, surprising news and events with a suitable flash sales events will gain significantly and bond much more effectively with their customer base. So where do these e-commerce trends leave China\\'s growing e-commerce industrial sector? Are Chinese e-commerce industry players well-placed to take advantage of these trends, or will their emergence be stifled somewhat? A glance at some of the recent initiatives that have taken place with some of the major Chinese e-commerce players suggests that an even stronger performance is to be expected during 2017. Tencent perhaps typifies the Chinese e-commerce sector. Earlier this month it announced a strategic partnership with Starbucks. Tencent\\'s messaging app, WeChat, will soon extend its payment service across Starbucks stores in Chinese mainland. In addition, Starbucks will present itself as a partner in the launch of a new \"social gifting\" feature of WeChat. Clearly, Tencent understands the importance of the trends discussed above, especially ease of payment and enhancing the emotional benefit of the online experience. Competition among China\\'s major e-commerce companies will also likely intensify during 2017, which can only be a good thing for consumer choice and industry quality standards. Tencent rival Alibaba looks set for a successful 2017. Earlier this year it very smoothly integrated the online video company Youku Tudou, thereby enhancing the overall market offering. Alibaba has also continued to increase considerably its content investment in the digital media segment. Its investments have included acquisitions in the areas of film, music and games. The Alibaba online platform has also been strengthened significantly from the formation of relationships with other investment companies. The international investment community is also bullish on Baidu, China\\'s major internet search engine. Many expect Baidu\\'s share price to outperform the market. However the really exciting possibility for 2017 is the likely emergence of a number of smaller, agile e-commerce companies. China is also well placed here, with a high-tech-led entrepreneurial culture spreading across the mainland. Younger generations, self-confident and savvy, could power China\\'s e-commerce sector to new, unimaginable heights in 2017 and beyond. We should also see e-commerce companies focusing more on specific industries, which should allow for a more personalized and enhanced customer experience. Smaller Chinese e-commerce player Mogujie is a typical example, where the company focuses almost exclusively on online fashion consumption. The name Mogujie literally means \"Mushroom Street\" in English. The company was co-founded in 2011 by a former engineer at Alibaba. Mogujie started out as a social site similar to Pinterest, where users create photo collages of fashion items. It evolved into a shopping site where the company derives income from merchants paying commissions. Expect more from Mogujie and other e-commerce companies that are similarly small and entrepreneurial. Overall, expect 2017 to be a year in which the e-commerce industry becomes more fragmented. Even the strongest, most entrenched e-commerce providers may experience unprecedented competitive threats from newly formed, entrepreneurial and internationally fearless e-commerce startups. In recent years it has been the Chinese e-commerce giants such as Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu whose emergence surprised many. But in years to come, it will be Chinese e-commerce entrepreneurs who will create even more surprises around the world. The most important trend, which will become crystal clear during 2017, is the consumer need for innovative, industry-focused e-commerce companies. Coupled together with a restless consumer who distrusts larger e-commerce providers and values stimulation, the door is wide open for entrance of e-commerce startups. Expect younger Chinese generations to grasp this opportunity for e-commerce startups with speed and determination that may outmatch even the Americans.

       " ['Britain\\'s health service is a gem. I should know. nan On Dec 12, I spent a fascinating, if at times painful, day in the company of Chinese, Filipina, Sri Lankan, Polish and English women. And it was all free - well, sort of. Let me explain. They were all nurses working for Britain\\'s National Health Service at Guy\\'s Hospital, and their job was to use equipment worth hundreds of thousands of pounds to monitor me in a series of tests. They were at the same time professional and friendly - I even managed to persuade the Chinese nurse, who hailed from Harbin, that she should buy a copy of China Daily\\'s UK edition from the news agent downstairs. Her Filipina colleague sang cheerfully as she worked. This, for me, represents the National Health Service at its finest.    Sadly, of late, it has become a political football, with the UK\\'s left-wing parties claiming the right-wing Conservative government of Theresa May is hell-bent on privatizing it. (In a word, Theresa, DON\\'T). Add to that a drip-feed of claims, mainly from so-called Little Englanders - foreigners who travel to Britain specifically to be treated for free in the system. One estimate I\\'ve seen, which I\\'ve no reason to disbelieve, is that so-called health tourists cost the NHS - and therefore the British taxpayer - 1.8 billion pounds a year (2.1 billion euros; $2.2 billion), of which only an estimated 500 million pounds is recoverable. But it\\'s a bit more complex than that. Foreign visitors from outside the EU, who come here specifically for free treatment, cost this country as much as 280 million pounds a year on top of that 1.8 billion pounds, and that is certainly unrecoverable. Here\\'s the wrinkle: When you check into the NHS facility, nobody asks for identification, and emergency treatment is automatic. If you are a foreign national, there are signs throughout NHS facilities requesting you politely to register with reception. How very British. When I had a bad road crash in the US way back in 1973, I lay on a gurney in the emergency treatment room in Ohio and was asked to provide details on my insurance coverage before they continued. How very American. NHS staff themselves have said it is not their job to act as a de facto border security force, demanding identity cards or passports from patients.    So what happens now is that for patients within the EU, the NHS can recover money from their respective countries. But the figure for so-called health tourists is just a drop in the ocean. The NHS is Britain\\'s largest employer, with a budget of 116.4 billion pounds and a permanent staff of 1.7 million. It is the world\\'s fifth-largest employer, beating labor-force-heavy outfits like China\\'s state energy sector and Indian Railways. Unbelievable, but true. The treatment it delivers is world class, coming as it does from a wide range of nationalities at the top of their game, and using state of the art equipment. No wonder many Britons were angered when right-wing US politicians, with a blinkered view of the world, sneeringly dismissed the NHS as \"socialist\" as President Barack Obama fought to introduce medical care for America\\'s poor and underprivileged. Those right-wing politicians would prefer giant insurance companies to run things, and cream off healthy profits. I read last year that China, which as far as I can tell has a highly complex healthcare system, has set up a joint study group with the NHS and UK government officials to see what it can learn from the UK experience. Well, is Beijing listening? As a newly diagnosed cancer patient, I can tell you the NHS works. I\\'ve had nothing but practical and positive support from every professional I\\'ve dealt with in the past six weeks, and the outlook is positive. Of course, I have over the years contributed about 11 percent of my salary in national insurance payments, like everyone else here. But that falls a long way short of the tens of thousands of pounds that my treatment will cost. From my point of view, it\\'s money well spent.

       " [\"Superior tech, stronger brands needed nan China has advocated innovation as a way to renew growth in the volatile global economy. Innovation will also act as a signal to the rest of the world that China is joining the ranks of the industrialized countries, which have historically relied on innovation to drive their growth. Advances in science are an important source of innovation. With continuous and heavy investment in research and development by both the government and high technology companies over the several decades, China's innovation capabilities are growing at an accelerated pace, and a number of technological breakthroughs have emerged. Examples of such high-tech companies include Tencent, one of the largest Internet companies in the world; Huawei, the largest telecommunications company in the world; and CRRC Corp, the largest railway vehicle manufacturer in the world. As these examples indicate, in some areas Chinese companies have completed their journey from catching up to leading the innovation race at the cutting edge of scientific development.   Significantly, China has outperformed other emerging economies, such as India and Brazil, in innovation. According to the latest Global Innovation Index released jointly by Cornell University, INSEAD and the World Intellectual Property Organization, in 2016, China joined the ranks of the world's 25 most-innovative economies. Switzerland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States, Finland and Singapore were in the lead. This is the first time a middle-income country has joined the highly developed economies that have historically dominated the top of the GII. This remarkable achievement has attracted much attention from Western scholars and policymakers, who are trying to understand the key ingredients that characterize the Chinese model of innovation. However, even within China, there is no clear definition of what the Chinese model is. The rise of high-profile e-commerce companies such as Alibaba and the on going problems it has with counterfeit goods only confound matters further, resulting in questions as to whether any truly innovative model actually exists in China. A related question is the trajectory of innovation, as the country aspires to move upward to join the advanced economies. There is a strong sense of urgency in China to move upward rather than stagnate, which has caused excitement and fear in equal measure among scholars, companies and policymakers. The country is once again at a crossroads, as it was more than 30 years ago when the opening-up policy and reform first began. But this time China needs a very different set of capabilities to succeed. After three decades of double digit growth, propelled by the combination of an abundant supply of cheap labor and large flows of inward foreign direct investment, growth is slowing and stagnating as these advantages disappear. In November 2016 I attended a research forum on innovation. Like many forums in China, it raised important questions and provided a platform for knowledge-sharing. This article is an attempt to reflect on these discussions and provide some initial thoughts based on my research findings. In the past 30 years, China's technological development has evolved from learning through technology transfer, reverse engineering and imitation to disruptive innovation and customer-led innovation. These models relied on rapid technological learning and absorption capacity and created value for Western clients as original-equipment manufacturers and for their domestic customers who demanded low-cost products with strong functionality. This development trajectory has been examined thoroughly and understood by most Western scholars studying China. However, as leading Western companies such as Ericsson and Facebook wake up to the shocks of Huawei becoming the world's top telecom supplier, Tencent's versatile social network platform WeChat competing for the dominant position, and the use of robots to deliver parcels by Shunfeng Courier Services, Western scholars are puzzled as to why some Chinese companies such as Huawei, Tencent and CRRC can break away from the traditional path-dependent trajectory of development to become truly innovative companies on the world stage. To solve this puzzle, one has to turn to the unique geographic, demographic and cultural formation of the country. It would be over-simplistic to describe China as a single market with 1.4 billion consumers. It would be equally ignorant to comprehend the country merely as a combination of dissimilar and disconnected regions. Despite their similarity in terms of the size of territories, it would be misleading to compare the US market with the Chinese market. The different layers of income and population density of Chinese cities and towns, combined with the cultural characteristics of interdependence, inner drive and tolerance, create a unique ecosystem that opens up multiple opportunities for Chinese companies to compete based on differential advantages. For example, for many Chinese companies low cost is the main competitive advantage. These companies have access to low-cost labor as well as a sufficiently large segment of domestic customers who are cost-conscious. However, Chinese companies have sufficient economies of scale and scope to experiment in different geographic regions and in different market segments to gradually proceed up the quality ladder and fulfill different needs, from utilitarian to hedonic. Companies like Huawei applied the strategy internationally by starting in developing markets like Africa and gradually moving to advanced regions like Europe. Having achieved a leading position globally, companies like Huawei will need to rely more on basic scientific research in areas such as artificial intelligence to keep competitors at bay. In addition, as the country's economy is slowing down and with air quality worsening and regulations tightening, many companies are investing abroad to deploy excess capacity, manage risk and access global market opportunities. This requires Chinese companies to work in a very different institutional and cultural environment, which requires a different set of core capabilities, including innovative capabilities, coordination capabilities, marketing communication capabilities and corporate social responsibilities. Another challenge facing the Chinese economy is the role of government. Historically, the Chinese government has played a key role in terms of policy incentives and financial investment in developing innovation capabilities. However, the results have been very mixed, with state-owned enterprises, research institutes and universities benefiting most from these incentives, whereas private enterprises have very limited access to resources. The recent policy of the government has been to change from the top-down planned approach to a bottom-up entrepreneurial approach. This is a significant policy shift, but for it to become embedded it needs a new ecosystem in which access to finance by private and startup companies can be provided. More fundamentally the country's education system needs a total revamp as it is outdated and geared toward passing exams rather than nurturing creative talent. Finally, and most important, after 30 years of accumulated wealth, the new Chinese middle class and its need for hedonic satisfaction and affirmation of self-identity can no longer be ignored. This segment of society will be the new engine for growth as the desire of its members to perfect themselves in all areas of their lives is insatiable and they are the most discerning customers in terms of quality, style and taste. This is particularly challenging for the traditional model of innovation, where the focus is on reducing cost and increasing efficiency rather than on superior quality and emotional connection with customers. This is a huge gap for China, and so far it has been filled almost entirely by Western brands such as Apple, BMW and Hermes, to name just a few. This is because, while the demand side has shifted from low cost to high-quality products, the supply side is still trapped by a low-cost production model, resulting in a mismatch between demand and supply. The value of innovation is to identify and satisfy the latent needs of sophisticated customers in China and worldwide. This requires both the tangible asset of intellectual property and intangible asset of brands. Looking around, the most innovative companies are also the best known brands and this is no coincidence. It is in this respect that the gap between China and the West is most pronounced. According to Interbrand's 2016 best global brands ranking, the top 100 most-valued brand positions are almost completely occupied by Western brands, with the exception of Huawei (No 72) and Lenovo (No 99). Statistics differ, but overall they agree that, although the quality of output varies, China has significantly increased its R&D spending and the number of IPR and scientific publications. However, China significantly lags in terms of the number of global brands. Brand-building requires a different mindset from that of low-cost production. A brand not only provides new functions but also tells a story that is meaningful and memorable, thus communicating unique value and ensuring customer loyalty. Brands are the embodiment of culture and rooted in heritage and history. They require confidence in one's cultural identity and history. China's economic success has brought about renewed confidence and interest in Chinese culture. Therefore, it is time to develop strong brands. A strong brand brings out the best of the culture of its country of origin, thus increasing the soft power of the country and its influence in the world stage. A new ecosystem of innovation is therefore required to break the path of dependency on the traditional innovation model to combine technological superiority with strong brand building.

       " ['China walks its own path to prosperity nan After a turbulent 2016, and with emerging hostility in the United States, the country can rely on an ancient solution The year 2016 proved to be a strange and difficult year for the world. The past 12 months have been turbulent for people everywhere. We have seen the continued rise of religious fundamentalism and the growing threat of terrorism by extremist groups, most recently in the atrocity committed in Berlin, where innocent people preparing for Christmas with their families and friends were murdered by a fanatic, intent on killing people whose views are not the same as his. We witnessed serious political turbulence in Turkey over the summer with the attempted military coup against the elected president - followed by the assassination of a senior diplomat in Ankara. We lived through another year of suffering in the Middle East, not only in Aleppo, but also across large parts of Syria and northern Iraq, while fighting in South Sudan forced the United Nations to warn that the situation may soon turn to genocide unless action is taken to bring peace in the country.    It has been a year when we have been reminded of the problems and dangers posed by climate change, not least in China, where there has been a stern reminder in recent weeks of the need to protect our environment and focus on growth that is truly sustainable. The two greatest shocks, however, have come from the Western world. First, in June, the United Kingdom voted for Brexit. What this will mean is not yet clear. However, the significance is not so much what it means for the UK and its relationship with the European Union or for its dealings with other countries around the world - especially when it comes to trade. Rather, the issue is whether the UK\\'s vote demonstrates the first point of collapse of the European Union itself. Elections in 2017 in France and Germany in particular will turn in large part on many of the questions raised during the Brexit vote - about democracy and accountability, about freedom of movement and the future of the single currency. This is important as far as China is concerned, and especially for Chinese businesses that either buy from or sell into countries within the European Union. As anyone involved in commerce knows, the worst thing in business is uncertainty. Not knowing what tariffs will (or will not) apply in the future is difficult for all those involved in a transaction. So too is the lack of clarity as to what decisions will be made in the coming months, and what their implications will be for both buyer and seller, who need to be planning ahead, especially in complex industries that come with heavy up-front capital costs. The second major shock wave has come in the United States, where the election of Donald Trump confounded the pollsters and analysts and threatens to upset an already uneasy global equilibrium. Trump raged against many targets during the election campaign, from Muslims to Mexicans - but also against China. The Chinese have been using the US as a piggy bank to rebuild China, he said in the buildup to the election, as well demanding that the US must stop jobs from being stolen. It is tempting to be carried away by such grandstanding rhetoric, and foolish to take it at face value. The Trump administration will be defined by what the president does now, rather than by what he has said. Besides, it would be foolish not to recognize that there is some truth in his observation that employment in the United States has been profoundly affected by the shift of manufacturing - and of jobs - primarily to Asia, and above all to China. The appointment of Peter Navarro, author of books titled The China Wars and Death by China, to the high profile role as head of the newly created White House National Trade Council is not promising for those who prefer to see transitions take place calmly and slowly. His urging consumers in the US to \"Help defend America and protect your family: Don\\'t buy Made in China\", suggests a tough line in months to come as Trump seeks to \"make American manufacturing great again\". The picture need not be gloomy for Chinese business, even in the event that relations with the US and the problems in the EU force a change of direction. Just over 2,000 years ago, Zhang Qian was sent out by the rulers of Han China to explore what opportunities lay to the west - in Central Asia. The envoy reported back that there were flourishing markets that had yet to be explored, where \"all sorts of goods are bought and sold\". There were many opportunities to look into that would serve to strengthen the economy at home and to enrich those abroad. Building connections across the spine of Asia was a key point in China\\'s development 20 centuries ago. These helped bring new ideas from far away, as well as goods and products - ranging from spices to foods, from technologies to scholarship - while opening a window for China onto the world beyond. What happens within the European Union and the United States, and in the relations of both with China and elsewhere, will be matters of profound importance for the global community. But it is the same region that Zhang Qian visited that is where China\\'s future now lies. Some two-thirds of the world\\'s population live in the countries of the Silk Roads - those lying along the Belt and Road Initiative. Many of these countries have large populations, such as Pakistan (nearly 200 million), Bangladesh (150 million), Iran (80 million), and of course India (1.2 billion) and Russia (150 million). These represent substantial markets individually. Collectively, they represent something much more important. Many are blessed with natural resources - like oil, gas, tin, zinc, gold, silver and more - that will play a major part in China\\'s own development in coming years. But all are filled with possibilities for businesses to cooperate and expand locally. Finding good partners locally requires patience and knowledge: To trust someone, especially when it comes to business, you need to understand them. That starts with understanding their history and understanding how you yourself are perceived - in other words, how they understand your history. The Silk Roads are rising. They will do so regardless of what decisions are made in London, Paris or Washington. The last 12 months have been difficult for many of the countries that are part of the Belt and Road Initiative, for a variety of reasons. However, as projects like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and the new deep-water port at Gwadar, Pakistan, show, there is considerable potential in the months and years to come. As Zhang Qian noted, the trick is to prepare properly, to find out what is being bought and sold, and not to rush to do too much too fast. The peoples lying west of China may have been \"poor in the use of weapons\", but they have always been \"very clever when it comes to commerce\". Preparing properly, setting realistic expectations and planning ahead is the key to unlocking the treasures of the overland and maritime Silk Roads. As has been the case for thousands of years.

       " ['Cheap Chinese solar panels are good nan A group of European Union parliamentarians have added their voices to calls from climate action groups and much of Europe\\'s solar industry for an end to punitive tariffs on Chinese solar power equipment. What is going on? Just as everyone else appears to be demanding higher tariffs, amid a predicted return to trade protectionism in Europe and the United States, along comes an unlikely alliance of industry, charities and politicians saying get rid of them. A letter signed this month by 22 members of the European Parliament, including the vice-chairs of the energy and international trade committees, helps to explain. In an appeal to the European Commission to scrap \"harmful\" duties, they said existing trade measures against China were stifling competition and damaging Europe\\'s own energy sector.    It looks as if this and other appeals may fail to sway the Commission, the European Union\\'s executive arm. The trade press this month quoted documents suggesting it would recommend keeping import duties and a minimum price for solar panels for two more years. A final decision has to come by March but interested parties have until Jan 6 to respond before the Commission makes a formal proposal to the EU\\'s 28 governments. In the present climate of protectionism emerging in Europe, it may turn out that the 28 would prefer not to court headlines about cutting tariffs on China and will go along with the commission. However, the MEPs who signed the letter argued that many European jobs depended on the solar sector and existing duties did not take into account Europe\\'s green energy targets. In short, cheap Chinese solar energy components are good for business and good for the climate. They were echoing arguments put forward by action groups, including Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund, urging the commission in October to remove trade barriers on solar panels. The charities said solar power is one of the key technologies Europe needs to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and to meet its obligations under the recent Paris climate agreement. \"We are therefore concerned that the current tariffs on imported solar panels are making solar power more expensive and slowing down the deployment of solar power in Europe,\" they told EC Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom. \"Instead of putting citizens at the heart of the Energy Union, the present trade measures negatively impact consumers and make their participation in the energy transition costlier,\" the charities said.    These appeals have in turn been echoed by 400 European solar energy companies, which demanded the EU immediately scrap a minimum import price (MIP) agreement that establishes a floor for Chinese solar modules. They said the arrangement was harming the growth of an important industry across the European continent. In fact the MIP deal, originally introduced to avert a trade war, is already almost defunct, since all the major Chinese producers pulled out of it. One company, JA Solar, explained that the actual price of modules in the EU was already well below the agreed minimum rate and falling, damaging its ability to stay competitive in Europe. The EU imposed anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on imported Chinese solar components of 51.5 percent and 5 percent respectively at the end of 2013. Chinese companies got around the barriers, and similar measures in the US, by setting up production elsewhere in Asia. EU tariffs aside, the most novel prediction about the solar sector in the coming year comes from Sven Lindstroem, CEO of solar tech company Midsummer. In a syndicated New Year look ahead to 2017, he claims that \"President Trump will turn green\". Although Donald Trump\\'s election, and some of his subsequent appointments, have been heralded as a victory for the oil and coal industries, Lindstroem notes that renewable energy is the most efficient way to make the US independent and self-sufficient. \"US citizens like independence, and so does President-elect Trump,\" he writes. According to Lindstroem, many American families already use oil-fired generators to produce their own electricity, and the growth of solar power would encourage many more to go off-grid. \"The revolution has just started,\" he writes, \"and it will take more than a policy shift to stop it.\" The writer is a senior editorial consultant for China Daily UK.

All 10 on board the boat were saved. Lu Wei / For China Daily  New bullet-train lines now open China opened two major high-speed rail lines on Dec 28, linking the country\\'s less developed southwest with built-up coastal areas. The openings also mark Yunnan province\\'s entry into the nation\\'s high-speed railway network. The new lines link its capital, Kunming, with Shanghai and Guangzhou. The 2,252-kilometer Shanghai-Kunming rail line traverses five provinces - Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guizhou and Yunnan - and cuts rail travel time between the two cities from 34 to 11 hours, according to China Railway Corp, the nation\\'s rail service provider. Satellites launched for ground imaging China launched two commercial remote-sensing satellites on Dec 28 to compete with foreign companies that dominate high-resolution ground imaging. The SuperView 1A and 1B were lifted atop a Long March 2D carrier rocket at 11:23 am from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in Shanxi province, according to China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp, developer of the satellite series. After the devices are placed in position 500 kilometers above Earth, they will start to take pictures with a ground image resolution of 0.5 meter - the clearest yet produced by Chinese commercial satellites, according to Yang Yike, director of high-resolution satellite projects at the company. Supervision of officials heightened China will continue its pressure against corruption in 2017, strengthening supervision and severely punishing officials who break Party rules, according to senior leaders. A pilot reform program for an integrated supervision system will also be on next year\\'s anti-graft agenda, a meeting of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee determined on Dec 28. The Party has gained the upper hand in the fight against corruption, and \"the high pressure against graft will be maintained\", a news release from the meeting said. Courts set up to improve efficiency Two new circuit courts - one in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, and the other in Zhengzhou, Henan province - were established on Dec 28 to improve judicial efficiency and reduce the burden of case hearings on the Supreme People\\'s Court. All 12 presiding judges of the Third Circuit Court in Nanjing will be from the top court. The presiding judges, with an average age of 45, each have at least 10 years of experience. Under the latest judicial interpretation issued by the top court, the current six circuit courts cover 26 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions across China. Join hands to beat bullies, experts say     Teachers, parents and public security authorities need to work closer together to combat bullying, according to a senior judicial official. The Supreme People\\'s Procuratorate, the top prosecuting authority, received about 1,900 cases related to school bullying in the first 11 months of 2016, leading to 1,100 arrests and 2,300 prosecutions, according to data released on Dec 28. Shi Weizhong, deputy director of the authority\\'s Juvenile Procuratorial Affairs Office, says Chinese laws covering juveniles are too general to provide guidance on intervention and rectification. Water projects promise benefits China plans to launch at least another 15 major water conservancy projects next year, increasing targeted investment in the field to more than 900 billion yuan ($129.7 billion; 124.1 billion euros; 105.8 billion), the Ministry of Water Resources announced on Dec 28. Having launched 21 projects in 2016, construction work is now underway on 106 projects altogether, increasing total investment to 800 billion yuan. The latest, the Yangtze-to-Huaihe Water Diversion Project, began on Dec 29. Students seeking success in startups A survey released by Renmin University of China on Dec 28 found that more than 120,000 college students - or 28 percent of respondents - are running their own business or have had a related experience. Only 10.2 percent said they don\\'t want to start their own business. The report is based on information collected from more than 430,000 students at 1,767 universities and colleges across the country. It found that chasing dreams and freedom are two main drivers for college students seeking to become entrepreneurs. Baby penguins go to \\'kindergarten\\' Sunasia Ocean World, an aquarium in Dalian, Liaoning province, has sent more than 20 young penguins to a \"kindergarten\" where they will learn survival skills. The penguins will be in class for two months, learning to eat on their own and practicing swimming, according to Han Han, a keeper at the aquarium. Penguins go to the kindergarten when they are 1 month old, Han said. It helps the youngsters get to know each other before the important business of finding a mate. Regulation details bike-sharing rules     To standardize the development of the online bike-sharing industry, the Shenzen Transport Commission unveiled a draft plan on Dec 27, adding violations such as illegal parking to people\\'s credit records. Renting bikes through smartphones and parking them at the users\\' convenience has grown in popularity. In Shenzhen, Guangdong province, there are about 120,000 rental bicycles, and the number is expected to increase to 210,000 by the end of January, according to the commission. Recognizing online bike-sharing as part of the city\\'s transportation system, the authority will integrate bicycle lanes and bicycle parking facilities in street renovations. Oil giants face $24m Bohai Bay spill claim Fishermen affected by the 2011 Bohai Bay oil spill are demanding 170 million yuan ($24.5 million; 23.4 million euros; 20 million) in damages from the oil giants behind the disaster. Lawyers representing 205 people from Yantai, Shandong province, who are suing China National Offshore Oil Corp and ConocoPhillips, revealed the compensation figure on Dec 28, according to a source at Qingdao Maritime Court. The plaintiffs claim their livelihoods have been severely affected by leaks from the Penglai 19-3 Oilfield. Two spills over a period of weeks in June 2011 polluted more than 6,200 square kilometers of the sea, according to investigative reports. Sao Tome restores ties with Beijing China and the African island nation of Sao Tome and Principe resumed diplomatic relations on Dec 26. Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his counterpart from Sao Tome and Principe, Urbino Botelho, signed a joint communique at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing to resume diplomatic ties. The ceremony on Dec 26. The African nation broke off ties with Taipei last week. Beijing suspended its relationship with Sao Tome and Principe in 1997 after that country established \"diplomatic ties\" with Taipei. Data fraud subject to criminal law Falsifying environmental data to avoid pollution regulations is a criminal offense, according to a set of new judicial interpretations on environmental crimes framed by the top court and top procuratorate and released on Dec 26. It is the first time for such fraud to be subject to criminal punishment. Previously, administrative penalties were usually meted out. The court and the procuratorate issued interpretations on a number of environmental offenses. The new interpretations, which take effect on Jan 1, are widely considered an indication that judicial punishment of environment-related crimes will be strengthened. Outbound tourism to see steady rise China\\'s outbound tourism industry is expected to see slower but steady growth over the next five years. Visits by Chinese outbound tourists are forecast to reach 150 million in 2020 from 117 million in 2015, with an estimated average annual growth rate of about 5.1 percent, according to the China National Tourism Administration. The administration released its 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20) on Dec 26. It said domestic visits by Chinese tourists in 2020 would reach 6.4 billion, with total revenue in the tourism industry soaring to 7 trillion yuan ($1 trillion; 960 billion euros; 820 billion). Tibetans lead team to South Pole Tibetan mountaineers have proved their world-class competence once again after two climbers from the region achieved \"seven plus two\" on Dec 25 - reaching the highest peaks on all seven continents and Earth\\'s two poles. Graduate students Tsering Tandar and Dechen Ngodup, sponsored by the China University of Geosciences in Wuhan, Hubei province, reached the South Pole at 6:16 am on Dec 25. In doing so, they finished the nine-challenge adventure known as the Explorers Grand Slam, which has been accomplished by only about 50 people in the world. Improved ties with Vatican sought China is willing to conduct constructive dialogue with the Vatican and hopes that the Vatican will adopt a flexible and pragmatic attitude, a top religious affairs official said on Dec 27 as the country\\'s Catholic church representatives gathered in Beijing for a national assembly. China\\'s stance on improving ties with the Vatican has long been that the country is willing to hold talks with the Vatican \"based on relevant principles to narrow differences and expand common ground\", Wang Zuoan, head of the State Administration for Religious Affairs, said at the opening of the Ninth Assembly of Chinese Catholic Representatives. 5-year visa aims to promote S. Korea South Korea will introduce a new five-year renewable visa in January to attract affluent Chinese tourists. The move was made against the backdrop of a decrease in Chinese arrivals in the second half of 2016. The visa allows holders to return for stays of up to 30 days. Chinese tourists who buy specialized four-day travel packages costing 17,350 yuan ($2,498; 2,389 euros; 2,038) or more can apply. China\\'s leading tour company, Ctrip, predicted that only 1 percent of mainland tourists would be eligible for the new visa. Testing starts on first maglev rail     Beijing\\'s first rail line using magnetic levitation technology is scheduled to start running next year, with engineers now testing the new trains, city officials announced on Dec 25. The overhead maglev line, called S1, will run in the western suburbs. It will stretch about 10 kilometers and have eight stations. The line will make scenic spots in Beijing\\'s suburbs more easily accessible to residents and tourists. Probes to head for Mars, Jupiter China plans to send unmanned probes to explore Mars and Jupiter by 2030, according to a senior space official. Wu Yanhua, deputy director of the China National Space Administration, said at a news conference in Beijing on Dec 27 that the government has decided to send a robotic probe to Mars to orbit and land on the red planet around 2020. The probe will conduct scientific research on the Martian soil and atmosphere and search for signs of water. A larger probe will set off for Mars around 2030 to take samples and return them to Earth, he said. Xi says support for UN remains firm President Xi Jinping praised cooperation between China and the United Nations and reaffirmed China\\'s firm support for the organization in a phone conversation on Dec 26 with outgoing UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Xi said the world is facing many new problems that require stronger global governance and more work from the UN, and he praised Ban\\'s contribution to deepening China\\'s cooperation with the UN during his 10 years as head of the organization. Xi stressed that China would maintain close cooperation with the incoming secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, to reinforce China\\'s ties. Regulator maps out cybersecurity strategy China\\'s top internet regulator has mapped out a national security strategy, aiming to safeguard cyberspace sovereignty, security and interests of cyberspace development. The Cyberspace Administration of China said on Dec 27 that the government will safeguard cyberspace sovereignty and national security, protect key information infrastructure and crack down on cyberterror and cybercrime. Wang Xiujun, deputy head of the administration, said the work includes international cooperation. Liaoning departs for Pacific drill The CNS Liaoning aircraft carrier battle group has set off for the Western Pacific where it will take part in an open-sea exercise, a spokesman for the People\\'s Liberation Army Navy has announced. According to the PLA Navy, the group carried out \"full-element\" training in the East China Sea on Dec 24, which mainly involved J-15 carrier-borne fighter jets. The planes performed air tactical confrontation drills and air refueling operations, while ships conducted resupply training, the navy said.   - Migrant workers hold up portraits taken for free by members of the Beijing Model Worker Association and photography enthusiasts during an activity on Dec 27 held by the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions to celebrate the new year.

       " ['Change to what? nan As a year of massive political shocks ends, and one whose outlines could not be more in doubt is just beginning The world economy is likely to face many challenges in the year ahead, not least an extraordinary level of uncertainty. United States President-elect Donald Trump takes the oath of office on Jan 20 and has promised protectionist measures against China and a program of fiscal expansion. Britain\\'s negotiations on quitting the European Union are likely to begin in the spring around the time of French presidential elections, both of which could have major implications for the future of the EU.    So where does this leave China? The world\\'s second-largest economy enjoyed a relatively benign 2016 with growth stabilizing at 6.7 percent in the first three quarters. External events - not least the possible US tariffs on Chinese imports - could partly derail its economic progress. The Chinese government made clear its own economic agenda at the Central Economic Work Conference, attended by senior leaders in Beijing, in December. It set out six directions of policy: maintaining medium-to-high \"new normal growth\"; stability; supply-side reform; a new development concept focusing on innovation and the development of green technologies; improving quality and efficiency; and combining policies at both the macro and micro level that work for the good of the overall economy. Vincent Chan, managing director and head of China research for Credit Suisse, who is based in Hong Kong, says that for the first three months of the year China will be trying to work out what the new policy agenda will be in the US. \"This is the major uncertainty. You have a situation where not just China but nobody else understands what this is going to be. Politics is going to be the big issue, which will influence the economics.\" Chan, however, believes China\\'s growth, assuming no major external shocks, should increase to 6.8 percent in 2017, 0.1 percent up from the level achieved so far this year. It will be notched upward by export growth of 8 percent, compared with the 6 percent contraction in goods and services sold overseas in 2016, he says.    \"The current high levels of infrastructure investment at two and a half times the level of nominal GDP growth will keep the economy steady at 6.5 percent, and exports will give it an additional push next year.\" Duncan Innes-Ker, regional director, Asia, of the Economist Intelligence Unit, based in London, says the Chinese economy will struggle to maintain its momentum in 2017. He believes growth will slow to 6.2 percent. \"What has driven growth in 2016, particularly in the second half, has been the construction sector, which has been related to the strength of the housing market,\" he says. (Property prices in the major cities have risen 30 percent over the year). Innes-Ker believes the current credit growth of 20 percent a year, fueling debt, is becoming unsustainable. He though thinks the government will wait until 2018 to tackle that, resulting in a hard landing, with growth slumping to 4 percent but recovering to 5 percent in 2019. \"If it doesn\\'t, there would be severe strains in the financial sector that would be very damaging in the longer term,\" he says. Louis Kuijs, head of Asia for the global advisory firm Oxford Economics, who is based in Hong Kong, thinks there will be no major change in economic policy until after the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of China in November, when a new Standing Committee will be elected. He believes policymakers will manage to achieve 6.3 percent growth. \"Growth will continue to rely on policy support in the form of fiscal expansion and, especially, generous credit growth. We do not expect policymakers to significantly slow the pace of credit expansion before the party meeting.\" Edward Tse, founder and chief executive officer of the management consultancy Gao Feng Advisory, says he is not particularly worried about debt in the Chinese economy. \"It has never been proven what is a dangerous level of debt. I don\\'t think right now China is at any major risk.\" Tse, also author of The China Strategy and who is confident the economy will enjoy growth of between 6 and 7 percent in 2017, believes debates about investment in infrastructure becoming increasingly inefficient in terms of return miss the point. \"I do not believe they take into account all the multiplier effects of having a highly efficient transport system. They might say a high-speed rail line from point A to B is not worth it, but they fail to see the benefit from the point of view of the whole rail grid being improved by the additional line,\" he says. Chan at Credit Suisse says the main worry about China is not the industrial economy but the financial system, as evidenced by the weakening of the yuan. In the year to November it had depreciated by a trade-weighted 8 percent. \"It is a measure to some extent of how important the Chinese yuan has become as a global currency,\" Chan says. \"I think it is less important than the US dollar or the euro, but now more significant than either the Japanese yen or the British pound. \"You can see this with market behavior over the past two months responding to the yen falling by 15 to 20 percent. There has been virtually no reaction. When the Chinese yuan falls by just 2 percent everybody seems to worry.\" The currency depreciation reflects concerns over rising debt in the system, shadow banking and bond market weaknesses, he says. \"It goes further than just being a matter of the exchange rate itself.\"    One of the major concerns is whether Trump is serious about imposing trade barriers on Chinese goods, such as the 45 percent tariff on imports proposed during the election campaign. On Dec 22 the president-elect sent an ominous signal by appointing Peter Navarro to the new post of director of trade and industrial policy. Navarro, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, has been highly critical of China. Wang Huiyao, president and founder of the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing, China\\'s largest independent think tank, believes the rhetoric seems to ignore the reality of a globalized world that relies on very sophisticated supply chains. \"This means that the iPhone is assembled in China and products sold by Walmart in the US are sourced from China. If we suddenly move away from this then consumers will be hurt - the very consumers who now seem set against globalization by voting for Trump and Brexit. \"We still live in a globalized world, and that is a fact. We sink or swim together.\" Tse, who is acknowledged as one of China\\'s leading business experts, believes that instead of putting up barriers, the US could receive a jobs boost from Chinese manufacturing investment in the rust belt. The Chinese automotive glass maker Fuyao opened a glass fabrication plant, which will be the world\\'s largest, in Moraine, Ohio, in October and created thousands of jobs. \"There is no reason why a Trump government should not welcome this kind of investment because it is not taking jobs from America but adding them,\" Tse says. However, he says, he is picking up sentiment from businesses that because of the uncertainty they may prioritize investment in locations on China\\'s Belt and Road Initiative and not in the US or Europe. \"More Chinese companies are looking to identify opportunities away from Europe and the US and are looking to central Asia, Africa, Southeast Asia and, in particular, are showing renewed interest in the Philippines after a major improvement in the political relationship between the two countries.\" One subject of increasing debate is whether the Chinese government will abandon its target of doubling its 2010 GDP by 2020 to become a high-income country by then. This was one of the central aims of the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20). Wang, a state councilor on the Chinese State Council, or cabinet, who believes growth will remain about 6.5 percent next year, says targets play an important role in driving economic activity in China. \"The government mandate is to set objectives for people to reach, and therefore people are motivated. I think it is important that the government has set the overall objective to reach this target.\" Chan at Credit Suisse says nothing is going to change until after the key party meeting in the autumn, but he believes there is more nuance in the goal set than is often perceived. \"Being a high-income society is actually a relative concept. By 2020 China might be a high-income society because other countries have not grown as quickly as it has over the previous decade. It will have achieved its objective without doubling GDP. It is not a discussion the government will have in 2017.\" Chan believes that as the year begins, the main concerns will not be about the Chinese economy, as they were last year, but about other things. \"China\\'s real economy currently has less uncertainty surrounding it compared with many economies in the developed world right now.

       " ['There but for the presence of China ... nan Expert lauds country\\'s role as economic savior and as a guarantor of continued stability The American economist Stephen Roach insists it is vital for the world economy that China continues to grow solidly in 2017. The senior fellow at the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs at Yale University says that even with its \"new normal\" levels of growth its economy remains the engine of the world economy. \"If there is a dramatic slowdown in China there would be a period of weakness we have not seen at any period since the end of World War II,\" he warns. Roach, also a former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, was speaking before giving a presentation on \"A World Without China\", looking at what would happen to the global economy without China\\'s economic momentum, at a lunch organized by the Center for China and Globalization, a think tank in Beijing. In the talk at the Park Hyatt Hotel in Beijing, he argues that world annual growth between 1980 and 2016 would have been just 2.7 percent - almost 25 percent less than its present 3.5 percent - without China growing at 9.7 percent during this period. And that if China\\'s growth was to fall from the 7.6 percent achieved in the first three quarters of 2016 to 5 percent next year, global growth would almost halve from 3.4 percent to 1.8 percent. \"Without China\\'s growth the world will have fallen into a very deep recession after the global financial crisis, and that would apply now,\" Roach says. He argues that since 1945 the world has had a major growth engine with the US powering the world economy in the 1950s, Europe growing strongly for much of the period and Japan and South Korea emerging before China. \"If China is not there, I don\\'t think the US will provide it. I don\\'t think Europe will or the rest of Asia or the resource economies will. The world will enter a period of significant weakness.\" Roach says that among the worst hit will be the European economies such as Spain, Greece and Italy, which already have high levels of unemployment. \"There has been a lot of structural unemployment since the end of the financial crisis, and the hope has been that rising global growth would be able to absorb that. This, however, will not happen in a world without China.\" Roach, who was brought up in Beverly Hills, California, began his career as a research fellow at the Brookings Institution in the 1970s after his doctorate at New York University. He then went on to work for the Federal Reserve before joining Morgan Stanley in the 1980s. He first got to know China well in the immediate aftermath of the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s when he challenged himself to visit the country at least twice a month. \"For about five years I spent half my time there, and even now that I am teaching I still come four or five times a year.\" Roach, who financially backed the Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in the recent election, is skeptical as to how Donald Trump as president can follow a fiscal expansion strategy while erecting trade barriers against China. He argues that the US would only be able to fund the resultant increased budget deficit with Chinese savings. US savings are 2.3 percent of GDP compared with China\\'s 40 percent. \"Fiscal expansion in a low-savings economy just spells bigger budget deficits and wider current account imbalances and trade deficits. This would put the US on a collision course with the protectionist policies that Mr Trump is also prescribing. \"Right now it is all blue sky and optimism (with the Dow Jones index hitting record highs in December) with little regard for some of the tougher issues which may be evident down the road.\" Roach, also author of Unbalanced: The Codependency of America and China, fears the world situation is now worse than it was even in the inflationary era of the 1970s. \"It is hard to say from a geopolitical point of view but I think it is worse. You have the populist backlashes, the lack of appetite for trade liberalization and globalization. \"At the end of the 1970s we had high inflation, slowing growth, the specter of inflation but we worked our way through that by economic means rather than geostrategic cooperation.\" Roach was encouraged by the Chinese government\\'s Central Economic Work Conference in December, which placed emphasis again on achieving \"new normal\" medium to high growth and supply-side reforms. \"China\\'s push toward supply-side reforms is welcome and important but it is not an excuse for not rebalancing the demand-side of the equation. \"What concerns me is that there is almost too much focus on the supply side without continuing to underscore the commitment toward consumer-led growth on the demand side. You need both supply and demand to drive China to the next phase and to avoid the middle-income trap.\" Roach welcomes President Xi Jinping attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, next month and says it will be a chance for China to show leadership, if the West is seen to be retreating under Trump. \"They will want to hear that China is still committed to dealing with global issues from climate change to trade and also opening its markets and borders warmly to other nations.\" He also believes much of the debate will be about the future of globalization, a concept almost led by China with its vital manufacturing role in global supply chains. \"Just where is globalization heading? There has been a lot of push-back against globalization; that is what Brexit was all about, that is what the ascendancy of Trump is all about and that is what potentially the election of Marine Le Pen in France is all about. \"These are some of the pressures that will be actively debated and discussed at Davos.\" Roach argues, however, that as with 2016 there is still little sign of the world finally lifting itself from the global financial crisis. \"The theory of resilience of economic cycles is that economies in general are elastic organisms, so imagine holding a big rubber band. The further you pull it down, the faster it snaps back. We have had a very deep downturn but a very anemic snap back. \"There are still enormous headwinds in this post-crisis climate. If it had not been for China the world would be in a much weaker place.\" andrewmoody@chinadaily.com.cn     - Stephen Roach, the senior fellow at the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs at Yale University, argues that world annual growth between 1980 and 2016 would have been just 2.7 percent - almost 25 percent less than its present 3.5 percent - without China growing at 9.7 percent during this period.

       " ['A story of deadly torrents and tears nan They were united toward a common goal 30 years ago. In trying to achieve it, 11 of their friends, peers and rivals had lost their lives. Now, as they met for a reunion, drinks and tears flowed freely. \"During the party in Beijing all of us drank late into the night, and we laughed and wept,\" says Chu Siming, 59, a member of the China-US Upper Yangtze River expedition in 1986. That mission called for a journey of about 2,500 kilometers lasting 10 weeks on rafts and kayaks through virtually uncharted waters. It would entail negotiating swirling torrents, dozens of waterfalls and precipitous drops. This was no scatterbrained attempt by a group of individuals to set a Guinness record but an effort that had the approval of the top sports authorities in China. Yet two strong undercurrents propelled the expedition from the start: national hubris and money.   - Above: The Sino-US joint team on the upper reaches of the Yangtze in 1986. Below: The group before leaving for the river. Jan Warren / For China Daily     In 1985, Ken Warren, an adventurer from Oregon in the United States, declared that he and a team would attempt to be first to raft the perilous upper reaches of the Yangtze, China\\'s longest river. The announcement raised public hackles. People questioned why foreigners had been handed the right to conquer a wild ribbon of water that, by dint of history and culture, enjoyed almost mystical national status. China Sports Service Co, an affiliate of the national sports authority, had signed an $800,000 deal (766,000 euros; 5653,000) with Warren allowing him to raft the upper reaches of the Yangtze and later to develop a commercial rafting operation. \"In the 1980s, China had just opened its economy to the outside world, and many government departments were seeking profitable projects,\" says Chu, who was an employee at China Sports Service Co, affiliated with the sports authority. In an apparent attempt to assuage public criticism, it was later announced that several Chinese rafters had been selected to join the US team. That recruitment drive had encountered difficulties of its own. Many of those approached rejected the opportunity, believing the mission to be too dangerous. Chu was among those who were undeterred. \"I signed up anyway,\" he says. \"I was young and willing to do anything new and exciting.\"    The company managed to find two other Chinese members for the 11-man joint team. One was a mountaineer from Sichuan; the other was from a sports school in Wuhan, Hubei province. Also with the team would also be photographer, a camera crew and a doctor, as well as a support group - including Warren\\'s wife, Jan - that would travel by road. News of the joint expedition garnered much interest in both countries, but it soon became clear that the US-China expedition would not be alone in its attempt. In China, many young people started organizing their own expeditions to beat the team to the prize. The most notable of these was led by Yao Maoshu, 32, a rafting enthusiast from Sichuan province. In June 1985 he started out alone, which some regarded as foolhardy. It was reported that before he set out he told his wife to get an abortion because he feared that he might not return and she would be a widow burdened with a child. After 1,300 kilometers in the water, Yao drowned when his raft overturned in the river\\'s treacherous Jinshajiang section. Some hailed him as a national hero. Apparently emboldened by the tale of heroism, many young Chinese men joined in the competition the next year. Like Yao, nine perished in the waters of the Jinshajiang section. After months of planning, it was decided that the joint team would set off in late July 1986 from the river\\'s source - the Tuotuo River on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, at an elevation of about 5,000 meters. The overland trek to the river\\'s source proved to be a stiff challenge for the team. Within a short time one of the team members, David Shippee, a National Geographic photographer, was suffering badly from apparent altitude sickness. Another team member, Ancil Nance, in his account of the expedition, Yangtze River Expedition, 1986: An Adventure, says another team member urged Shippee to drink and think of his wife. \"It\\'s not worth it,\" Nance quotes Shippee as saying about the expedition. \"Then he slumped in our arms. We carried him to his tent. By midnight he was dead.\"    Chu says he vividly recalls the power of the river and says that some sections of the Yangtze may never be conquered because of the extreme rapids. One of those sections is Tiger Leaping Gorge, in northwestern Yunnan province. When the team was about 320 kilometers from there, on Aug 28, 1986, Warren wrote in his diary: \"We were mauled by the river, bounced around like the inside of a pinball machine or maybe a washing machine. ... In a dreamlike sequence our boat was crushed by a mountain of water. It felt like we had hit a brick wall at 20 miles an hour (32 km/h).\" Chu says: \"Rocks lay hidden under the rapids, and there was turbulence beyond the rocks. The river was totally unpredictable, and you realized that the normal principles of buoyancy did not apply. You could be pulled into a hole by the power of the rapids, and sometimes it was like being in a runaway car with no brakes. It\\'s difficult to put the fear into words.\" However, as the team battled with nature, other problems were simmering in Yushu, Qinghai province. Nance said several team members, whom he called dissidents, voiced their disgruntlement about how things were being run. Eventually four Americans quit the expedition. The rest of the team pressed on for another 650 km, but neither it nor any other team cleared the Jinshajiang section where the river drops more than 3,000 meters, and where the rapids are especially vicious. Warren said in an entry in his diary that his 10.8-meter-long boat, the most advanced rafting vessel at the time, was tossed around like a toy. Even for a veteran like him, the power of the Yangtze was indescribable, he said. In summer this year, two reporters, Du Xiuqi and Chen Chuhan, spent four months interviewing members of the Chinese teams and retraced the route from Xining, Qinghai province, to Batang near Chengdu, Sichuan province, where Warren\\'s team ended its adventure. \"I chanced upon a memorial of the expedition in Tiger Leaping Gorge when I traveled there earlier this year,\" Chen says. \"It was a shocking and tragic story, and I realized that young people like me knew nothing about it.\" Chu says that instead of comparing the expedition to an adventure gone wrong, people should see it as a test of human resolve. \"I found rafting to be more about what it means to be human than an adventure. In an extremely dangerous and unfamiliar situation, even a little problem can be amplified into a big one.\" The problem the joint team faced was not only the difficulty of the route but also shortages of food, he says. However, after Warren and others finally acknowledged nature as the winner in their intrepid tussle, more battles lay in store when they returned to the US. The Warrens faced at least six lawsuits from some of the American team members, including one for wrongful death. In June 1990 the couple were vindicated in all the lawsuits, but Jan Warren says they paid more than $180,000 out of pocket for legal fees. Ken Warren died early the next year. \"I simply couldn\\'t handle all the loss,\" Jan Warren says. \"I was angry and I had to spend a lot of effort to heal the mind and support my then-13-year-old son.\" At one stage she refused to even talk about the expedition but says she eventually felt compelled to write about it on behalf of her husband, who was posthumously recognized with a lifetime achievement award in Beijing \"I just cried when I saw the trophy. It is beautiful,\" she says. That is why she decided to tell the story of the China-US expedition in a book she self-published in the US, 1986 Sino-US Upper Yangtze River Expedition, for which she has sought a publisher for a Chinese version. Chu was among the attendees at the party in Beijing on Oct 29, along with Jan Warren, Zhang Jiyue (another member of the expedition) and two Chinese reporters who had been attached to the joint team. There was \"lots of laughter, talking and reliving\", Jan says. \"I spent the day with Chu and we had a wonderful talk about the expedition.\" Chu, who is now in the real estate investment and art business, gave up rafting many years ago, but Jan Warren is as keen on it as ever. She holds onto the dream of promoting rafting as a sport in China. \"One of the things I still want to do, even if I am too old, is to organize Chinese tourists to river raft in the US. Lots of Chinese tourists come to the US these days, and we want to show them the excitement, but in a careful way.\" Chu reckons that as a result of the ill-fated expedition, young people may have been deterred from the sport. To this day the feat that those intrepid rafters attempted 30 years ago remains unaccomplished. xuxiaomin@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/30/2016 page1)'],\n",
       " ['New year will be marked by change nan Uncertainty will dog 2017 but it will be offset by immense opportunity It has been a monumental year for Chinese companies\\' overseas investments. The companies, as a group have become the world\\'s largest source of foreign direct investment. According to Bloomberg, as of Dec 8. Chinese cross-border merger and acquisition activity for the year reached $237.7 billion (227.6 billion euros; 194 billion) - including $63.9 bilion and $83.4 billion on US and European acquisitions respectively - a year-on-year increase of 186 percent. If the past quarter of 2016 is a sign of what is to come in 2017, then Chinese outbound investments will likely face a much more complicated environment, with the new year likely to be one of more geographically diversified M&A coupled with a decline of overall M&A volume, especially in the early part of the year. In November 2016, the Chinese government made a decision to restrict capital outflows by increasing the scrutiny of Chinese outbound acquisitions over $10 billion and acquisitions of over $1 billion that are unrelated to the \"core business\" of the Chinese buyers. At the same time, the government also singled out investment in certain industries, such as foreign entertainment, hotels, real estate, film, and professional sports, where there will be increased scrutiny. These additional capital controls didn\\'t just affect Chinese firms. Foreign companies were surprised to discover that the amount of cash needing approval by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange to be remitted abroad dropped from $50 million to $5 million and that the entire process will take more time than it did previously. The results of the US presidential election and the rise of political populism in a series of other countries, including many in Europe, are casting major uncertainty on global politics. Both domestic and foreign pressures will force Chinese companies to become smarter and more knowledgeable when it comes to their global M&A goals and strategies. How relations between the United States and China will evolve once Donald Trump becomes president remains highly uncertain and difficult to predict. There seems to be a prevailing political wind against further Chinese acquisitions of US companies, given the background of Trump\\'s major campaign controversies related to China throughout his presidential campaign. It remains to be seen what awaits Chinese investors in the US in 2017, but a highly likely scenario is one in which it will be more difficult for Chinese acquisitions to get approval from the US government in sectors the government deems sensitive or potentially involved with national security. However, for the other sectors, one would be hard-pressed to imagine why and how the US government would not welcome Chinese investment. A case in point is Fuyao Glass, which is investing $1 billion in the US, including a $500 million investment in Ohio to build the world\\'s largest automotive glass plant. According to Cao Dewang, Fuyao\\'s chairman, the decision to invest in the US was based on analysis comparing the economics of producing glass in the US and in China. He concluded that it is in fact cheaper to produce in the US. By building a plant there, Fuyao\\'s investment would create between 2,500 to 3,000 local jobs. And job creation in the US, particularly in the blue-collar segment in the US rust belt, is a priority for the country. Europe will probably continue in some form of economic stagnation in 2017. It may follow the US in policy-setting regarding Chinese businesses in some areas (China\\'s non-market-economy status, for example), but it may also decide to strike out on its own path in areas where it feels there would be tangible benefits to its member countries. We expect Chinese companies to continue their interest in acquiring European companies - to gain access to necessary and more advanced technologies, for market access, or for bringing the acquired companies to the China market as part of business expansion. The greatest risk for Chinese investors looking at European opportunities in 2017 will be an increase in local populism. European populism will be a wild card in 2017 that could cause Chinese companies seeking acquisition opportunities to be suddenly shut down by European leaders to satisfy their own citizens and fend off attacks from political rivals. When Brexit becomes a reality in 2017, the United Kingdom will likely feel more vulnerable and possibly drive the UK government and its companies to cooperate more with their Chinese counterparts. Already since the referendum, the pound sterling has depreciated quite a bit, from its high of 1:1.47 USD in May to 1:1.24 USD at its lowest to date in December, making the price of UK assets cheaper relative to the USD and RMB. This presents Chinese investors with opportunities to find good deals such as those found in British real estate investments. As China looks at the world, there is clearly ample space beyond the US and Europe. In the past several years, China has stepped up its effort to play a more visible and influential role in international governance and geopolitics. The Belt and Road Initiative, though still nascent, is an ambitious and multinational program that could open up opportunities for Chinese and non-Chinese companies. Some of these initiatives can be huge and will take some time to materialize, if at all, but for the moment, good momentum is being generated. We expect to see a higher degree of Chinese M&A activities in the countries along the Belt and Road. I recently visited Manila in the Philippines and met with a number of senior business executives. There was quite a high degree of interest from the Filipino business community regarding Chinese companies\\' investment in their country. This coincides with the renewed, improved diplomatic relationship between China and the Philippines - and, after all, the Philippines is also strategically located at the beginning of the Maritime Silk Road. Of course, the Philippines is not the US or Europe. Nonetheless, it is an example of where Chinese investments are very much welcome. We also expect more investment from Chinese companies along other parts of the land and maritime Silk Roads, and it will come not only from Chinese state-owned enterprises but also from private companies. Africa, in particular, could see a step-up in such activities, as many African countries need more and better infrastructure, and some of them are rich in resources that China desires. Strategically, China also sees Africa as an important ally. Certainly, 2017 will bring uncertainties. In some cases, the Chinese companies\\' overseas buying spree may be dampened, but in other cases it will probably happen with even more speed and intensity. Economic nationalism will manifest in different ways across different countries. There will be a dampening of acquisitions in selected sectors, yet globalization and regional development will be intensifying in their own ways, and progress will continue. Though a year of uncertainty, 2017 will also be a year of change - and for some, the uncertainty will be related to the immense opportunities.

       " ['A land shaped by water\\'s ebb and flow nan Challenge has created mentality among Chinese that almost any problem faced by the nation can be solved by engineers Science writer Philip Ball believes water has played a key role in determining China\\'s destiny. This is the main argument of his new book, The Water Kingdom: A Secret History of China, which examines the country\\'s long history through the prism of this vital aspect of its physical geography. \"China has had to develop a relationship with water that is unparalleled. You have a combination of factors that you don\\'t see anywhere else in the world,\" he says.   - Philip Ball says he has been interested in Chinese culture since he was a teenager. Nick J.B. Moore / For China Daily  \"You have places like Bangladesh, where there is a constant risk of extreme floods; and the Middle East, where there are always problems of water shortage; but China has to deal with both.\" Ball, 54, was speaking outside the British Library near St Pancras in central London, where he is currently researching a new book. He fully acknowledges that water is not the only perspective to see China from but it is a useful prism. \"What I hope is that by narrowing the focus to this particular window, it enables you to tell an extraordinary and surprising amount, not just about Chinese history but politics, culture, art, philosophy and language even.\" Ball says water would not necessarily be a particularly useful vantage point for the history of his own country, famous for its rainfall.    \"Every country and civilization has had to be close to water and have a relationship with water. In the UK, for example, we have plenty of it, as a whole, and it is just a matter of making sensible use of it.\" The writer says it is no accident that one of the heroes of China\\'s history, Emperor Yu, founder of the Xia Dynasty (c. 21st century-16th century BC), was effectively a hydraulic engineer. He created a river system involving irrigation canals that prevented farmland from being flooded. \"He is not like a Noah figure who rides out the flood. He is someone who takes matters into his own hands and introduces engineering measures such as carving channels and dredging rivers to make floods subside. \"Like many people in Chinese myth and legend he is more of a remote administrator figure, unlike the sharp personalities you get in Greek or Norse myth or, indeed, with Noah who was the progenitor of the whole species (according to Christian doctrine).\" Ball says China\\'s essential water problem is that water flows from the mountains of the west to the seas in the east but the challenge throughout history has been getting grain from the farmlands of the south to the north. One of the great engineering solutions to this was the Grand Canal, some of which dates back to the 5th Century BC, which links the Yangzte and Yellow rivers. \"The Yangtze valley is below the Yellow River valley so you have got an uphill gradient going north. So you have this contrast of the water-poor north and the water-rich south,\" he says. One of the China\\'s modern grand schemes is the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, which aims to channel water from the Yangtze in southern china to the north through three canal systems. The $79 billion (74.3 billion euros; 62.3 billion) scheme, which will shift 44.8 billion cubic meters of water, is one of the world\\'s most expensive engineering projects. \"It actually goes under the Yellow River through tunnels. It would be hard to find any other nation prepared even to contemplate something in this scale but China has the capacity to do this.\" Ball, who was brought up on the Isle of Wight off the south coast of England, studied chemistry at Merton College, Oxford before going on to do a doctorate at Bristol University in theoretical condensed-matter physics. After university, he went to work for Nature magazine, the leading British science publication that has been in existence since Victorian times, as a writer and editor on physical sciences.    It was while on a three-month sabbatical from the magazine in 1992 he made his first visit to China. \"I would say that from a teenager I had this interest in Chinese culture and under this very enlightened scheme Nature had, I thought this is my chance to finally go,\" he says. He made use of his existing contacts there and spent the first month visiting science laboratories across the country and then generally traveling around. \"Looking back, it was an interesting time to be there (the year of Deng Xiaoping\\'s Southern Tour which unleashed economic reforms) but it was still tough to travel in China.\" Ball now makes regular annual trips to China and acts as a consultant to the Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics. \"I go there and speak about the work they are doing, which relates to the molecular structure of water, an area I have long been interested in. \"Over the past 10 years I have pretty much gone to China every year with my family. I have a lot of contact there and friends in virtually every Chinese city.\" Ball left Nature in 2001 (although he still contributes to it) to focus on writing books, of which he has published around 20. Critical Mass: How One Thing Leads to Another in 2004 won the Aventis prize for science books, and The Music Instinct in 2011, about why music matters to people, prompted a huge debate. \"I have always done music in one way or another. I played in bands in Bristol and I wanted to find a way of writing about music drawing on my scientific background.\" His new book contains many themes that are still relevant to China. Only in 2007, the Yellow River, whose origin is the Qinghai Tibet plateau, dried up for 10 months before reaching the sea. \"It had happened in the historical past but this was a real warning and a real shock. It was to do with overuse of river water, too much being taken out for industrial use, agriculture and irrigation. Over the past 10 years, management of the river seems to have been getting better,\" he says. Ball says China\\'s water challenge has created a mentality among the Chinese that almost any problem the country has can be solved by engineers. Until recently many of the country\\'s leaders including Deng Xiaoping and Hu Jintao have been engineers. \"I think that is part of the reason why China has had this appetite for huge engineering projects. There is a view in the West that they should perhaps be more like China and that there be more scientist and engineers in positions of power.\" As well as being fascinated by its water history, Ball has a deeper commitment to China with he and his wife having adopted a Chinese baby in 2006. Mei Lan is now 11 and the elder of their two daughters. The book is dedicated to her. \"That is the reason why we go back to China a lot because we are keen she has contact with her Chinese roots,\" he says. All the family are, in fact, now learning Mandarin. \"I can read menus in restaurants so I know what I am ordering, and get a taxi to get around. I am not sadly able to read the Tang Dynasty poets, but, you know, one day.\" Ball, also a judge of this year\\'s Baillie Gifford prize for non-fiction, is turning his attention away from China for his next book, which will be about modern myths. \"I am struck by how many stories such as Frankenstein, Dracula, Jekyll and Hide and even Sherlock Holmes have become modern myths while perhaps having mediocre literary credentials.\" andrewmoody@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/16/2016 page32)'],\n",

All the meat products will be put on the Chinese market after passing quarantine inspection, says the Sichuan Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau. The train saves 45 days of transport time compared with ocean shipping, and saves 10,000 yuan ($1,448; 1,377 euros; 1,154) per ton when compared with air freight. The China-Europe freight train marks the opening of the railway channel for China to import meat products from Europe. Chinese fund invests $4 billion in Africa The China Africa Development Fund, an equity investment fund managed by China Development Bank, had invested $4 billion (3.8 billion euros; 3.1 billion) in Africa as of the end of November, authorities said on Dec 14. Since its establishment in 2007, the fund has invested in 88 projects in 37 African countries.

       " ['The language of luxury nan New store in London caters to fashion house customers from China with more tailored services Italian menswear designer Ermenegildo Zegna has taken Chinese customers to heart, with salespeople speaking their language at its new and largest store on London\\'s Bond Street. The store, launched on Nov 9, has hired Chinese-speaking sales staff and is offering the services of a Chinese consultant who can explain the brand\\'s history and culture. The luxury menswear brand\\'s CEO, Ermenegildo Zegna, says the move shows a strong focus on Chinese shoppers as a result of the soaring number of Chinese tourists visiting the UK.   - Ermenegildo Zegna, the fourth-generation CEO of his family\\'s fashion house and brand. Wang Mingjie / China Daily  The fourth-generation CEO of the family-run fashion house says: \"Chinese customers are one of our biggest clientele. By offering native-speaking staff who understand the culture and the customers\\' needs, we are able to bring a comfortable shopping experience to our Chinese patrons.\" The Italian company, which owns sheep farms in Australia that supply wool to its Italian mill, opened in China in 1991. It was the first luxury apparel company to launch in the Chinese market, and China is now its biggest single market, accounting for about a third of its global sales of 1.26 billion euros ($1.34 billion; 1.07 billion) in 2015. \"This would not have happened if we hadn\\'t taken the market seriously by making an early entry, building the right store, creating the right team and continuing to invest in new things,\" Zegna says. He believes China is a market where retailers cannot stand still, because customers keep asking for more and the competition is fierce.    \"To remain a leader as a menswear luxury brand in China you have to keep renewing yourself and reinvesting in the brand to make sure that people are given superior service and a constant innovative brand proposition,\" Zegna says. He adds that China\\'s key stores are a testing ground for new products and new ideas, as Chinese customers enjoy looking for something new. Recently Zegna spoke to China Daily about his vision and strategy and new opportunities for Zegna\\'s operations in China. Following are edited excerpts of the interview: How would you describe Zegna\\'s prospects in China in the current economic environment? Our commitment to China has been demonstrated over many years. As you know, we have been dressing Chinese men for over 25 years, dating back to 1991 when we opened our first China boutique in Beijing. Throughout this time we have been fortunate to see the amazing change and development that has made China what it is today. We have offered the Chinese gentleman unparalleled craftsmanship and bespoke style that is both modern and highly relevant to their wardrobe needs. When I look at China\\'s future, I believe digital is the key - everyone in China has a mobile phone. We have to understand quickly how customers\\' desires change and that\\'s why you need to be connected as a brand and tell your story via mobile. This generation has been rocked by digitization, and the organic integration of online and offline sales can offer a whole new development path for the Zegna brand in China and globally. What is your company\\'s biggest achievement here since 1991, when Zegna entered this market? As you know, we are a fourth-generation family business, which I am sure you will agree is already a great achievement in itself. I believe our biggest achievement is the huge following we have developed with our Chinese customers. Over the past 25 years, we\\'ve been offering consistent excellence in quality, fabrics, service and innovation. This has resulted in Zegna having an extremely loyal Chinese customer base. I am glad to say that, thanks to our dedication and passion, we are still able to deliver to our global customers of all ages and backgrounds, and to Chinese gentlemen even after such a long time in the market - a contemporary image and esthetic. As one of the first few luxury brands launched in China in the early 1990s, and having witnessed the evolution of luxury brands, how would you describe Chinese consumer trends with regard to luxury brands over the last 20 years? Chinese consumers have become a driving force for global innovation and this is especially true in fashion. We see our Chinese customers as some of the most discerning customers Zegna has, and I know our new creative director, Alessandro Sartori, is very much looking forward to getting to know our customers on the Chinese mainland. In your view, what is the secret of Zegna\\'s success in China? We embrace our fourth-generation family heritage, with a relentless focus on quality and service. We have always been able to adapt and move forward with innovation. We have to move quickly in terms of product innovation and need to create continuous excitement in our stores, which we can do also thanks to our supply chain. We also place critical importance on understanding the culture of each of our markets globally. We strive to understand local traditions as much as possible. Other than seeing the world from a global perspective, you have to see it from a more local point of view. We love interpreting local desires by anticipating new trends. To do that, you need to spend quality time with customers. With this local vision, we will continue to place great importance on the Chinese market. I believe our customers in China feel this and respond accordingly by being very loyal to the Zegna brand. What do you think is the competitive edge of your brand in China? I think China is still at the forefront of luxury in Asia. Competition for luxury brands is fierce, and we need to invest a lot of ourselves in terms of budget, energy, ideas and time to make sure we are competitive. Storytelling is crucial, since you need to convey an emotion through the product. Nevertheless, we will continue to offer the hallmarks of the Zegna brand - luxury, style, quality, craftsmanship and, of course, innovation in every area. What essential leadership qualities do you consider most important when leading your team to growth in the Chinese market? You must strive to find a good way to communicate with the team, and keep an open mind. You also have to look into the long-term future but at the same time must not forget about the original values and traditions. How do you handle the challenges your team has encountered in China, if any? I think it is the same with every market. You figure out what works, and you constantly flex your business strategy to meet the demands of a market. The fantastic thing about being a family company is our ability to move quickly. This has become so critical in this world, where customer preferences and the retail landscape have shifted so quickly. What are the dreams you have for your company in China? I am in awe of the progress China has made in the 25 years I have been operating in the Chinese market. When you look at the absolute growth, the numbers in China year-on-year are astounding. I want us to continue to share our heritage with this fascinating country and culture. What are your hobbies? How do you spend your time outside of work when you are in China? I like to play tennis on weekends, skiing in the wintertime and walking in the countryside. I am also passionate about vintage car races. wangmingjie@mail.chinadailyuk.com (China Daily European Weekly 12/16/2016 page31)'],\n",
       " ['Property developers set to ride out market turbulence nan Analysts say conditions may be challenging but bright spots abound China\\'s property developers will ride out challenging market conditions like slowing sales growth, debt pressure and fewer financing channels and see a stable 2017 marked by slower yet positive growth, industry analysts say. Debt management will improve, demand for housing in key cities will be sustained and the \"develop-and-manage\" model will find acceptance, which will help developers explore new paths for development, they say. \"Concern about surging debt pressure seems to have found a solution, with more developers using financial tools to hedge risks,\" says a research note from Ping An Securities. China\\'s real estate developers have been clearing their US dollar-denominated debts to prevent losses as the currency has been strengthening against the Chinese yuan in recent months, a situation that may pile more pressure on smaller players than bigger ones. The financial health of developers worsened recently as sales slowed due to policymakers\\' moves against potential overheating in the residential market in key cities and speculative buying, the analysts say. Dollar-debt issuers have been learning lessons from the past. They are reducing losses caused by exchange rate fluctuations through swap transactions or by retiring debts well before maturity. Issuing US-denominated bonds in overseas markets was a major financing channel for many developers in the past three years. Interest rates were lower than other channels. But now, this \"low-cost\" financing option is no longer economical, as the dollar has gained more than 3 percent against the yuan in the past two months. According to data from Shanghai-based Wind, a financial information provider, China\\'s real estate developers have been retiring dollar-denominated debts before maturity since the beginning of November. So far, they have cleared debts of more than $1 billion (940 million euros; 788 million). For instance, on Nov 28, Hong Kong-listed, Chongqing-based LongFor Properties Co informed the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that it had redeemed callable bonds of $417 million maturing in 2019. Analysts say that such moves will help developers reduce losses caused by exchange rate fluctuations and will help create more room for further financing. \"The trend is that more developers who bought US dollar debts are going to do the same, as they are likely to shift from overseas markets back to the domestic market for financing,\" says Zhang Dawei, an analyst at Centalaine Property. A research note from Moody\\'s, which rates 50 listed developers in China, says the outlook for developers for 2017 is \"stable\" as support from market demand remains, income is steady and pressure for financing and refinancing is under control. \"Credit indicators of rated developers ... have been improving, creating easier financing conditions that potentially bring more liquidity to the market. The total size of developers\\' debts that mature in 2017 is relatively small, and both loan and bond markets are open to developers, so risks for refinancing are under control,\" says Yang Liu, an analyst with Moody\\'s, in the research note. The report says that the risks developers face are largely not from external market conditions but from internal factors, including decreasing support from the parent group concerned or disagreements among shareholders, which vary case by case. Only two out of 50 rated developers are facing considerable pressure in re-financing, says Moody\\'s. Ren Zhiqiang, former chairman of real estate company Huayuan Property Co Ltd and a real estate market veteran, says as long as economic growth is positive, job opportunities will increase, urbanization will proceed apace, solid demand for residential properties in key cities will remain robust and developers that hold quality projects in such cities are likely to see stable cash flow through sales. Urbanization and China\\'s shifting economic growth pattern, driven by consumption, will generate more diversified demand, giving developers more opportunities to come up with new types of project, say analysts. A research note from CICC says that about 100 million residents will be migrating to urban areas in the next few years, creating a leasing market whose size will exceed 1 trillion yuan ($144.91 billion; 136.2 billion euros; 114.3 billion). \"We expect that long-term leasing services will take some 20 percent of the entire leasing market in the next few years, and it is observed that more developers are entering this market,\" says the research note. Increasing numbers of developers listed in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong are also adopting more sophisticated business models, shifting from previous \"develop-and-sell\" to \"develop-and-manage\". Some developers are building up communities that integrate commercial properties, residential properties, and public facilities all together, say analysts. wuyiyao@chinadaily.com.cn    (China Daily European Weekly 12/16/2016 page27)'],\n",

Milark started an online art business earlier this year and was attracted to the current office - an arm of Tsinghua University\\'s X-lab - in October. The lab, in Zhongguancun, the heart of China\\'s Silicon Valley, supports more than 900 entrepreneurial teams whose projects range from mobile internet and new materials to artificial intelligence. \"With the rising of the middle class, China will become the leading market for outstanding young artists from Europe and around the world,\" Milark says confidently. He graduated from Tsinghua University two years ago.  - Students from China and Germany discuss their projects as a multinational team. Provided to China Daily  Mao Donghui, executive director of the X-lab program, explains the mission: \"Talent is the foundation of innovation for the new economy. A new kind of education is key for training innovators. We hope to help students from home and abroad master the basics of innovation and creating business startups. These are the engine for the future.\" China and Germany have cooperated in the areas of economics, culture and education in order to promote upgrades over the past decade. In June, China\\'s National Development and Reform Commission and the German Federal Ministry of Economy and Energy hosted the eighth Sino-German Economic and Technical Cooperation forum. And in June, Qian Yingyi, dean of the Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management, signed a memorandum of understanding with Helmut Schoenenberger, CEO of the innovation center at Technical University of Munich, calling for collaboration between German and Chinese startups. It covers student exchanges, education sharing and creating and Tsinghua\\'s X-lab is closely involved. \"We will promote in-depth cooperation for students from both countries and explore new models of international innovation and entrepreneurship education,\" Mao says. Tsinghua\\'s X-lab, founded in 2013, aims to lighten the burden of creativity for undergraduates and to provide basic training and support. \"X\" means exploration of the unknown, as well as discipline and integration. The word \"lab\" reflects learning through practical experience and teamwork. As of the end of October, more than 20,000 students had participated in lectures, competitions, exchanges and activities organized by X-lab. Some 943 programs launched by Tsinghua students and alumni joined the lab, whose registered financing has exceeded 1 billion yuan ($145 million; 137 million euros; 115 million). And they created more than 5,000 working positions, according to Emily Wang, information officer of X-lab. Mao says 14 entrepreneurial teams from China and Germany applied to join the bilateral program this year. Students from both countries conduct market explorations while networking and participating in cultural exchanges. \"They set up temporary multinational teams and learn from field work to look for practical solutions by themselves. This is the most valuable experience for them.\" The trip to Germany allowed students to communicate with local IT and law experts, helping them understand how to enter the European market, says Zheng Qi, senior director from international program of X-lab. She says some students even planned to launch their services in Germany and China in the near future. According to Mao, the project will be held every year in Munich and Beijing to benefit more German and Chinese students. X-lab will also seek cooperation with other major universities in other countries to cultivate a global vision for the future entrepreneurs. \"The partnership between the X-lab entrepreneurship center and innovation of Technical University of Munich not only adds vitality to the Sino-German cooperation but also helps cultivate innovative international enterprises for both countries,\" German Ambassador to China Michael Clauss wrote in a letter to Qiu Yong, president of Tsinghua University. wuyong@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/16/2016 page26)'],\n",
       " ['Chint Group expands through offshore deals nan Company rides explosive growth to move beyond the manufacturing of electrical equipment Zhejiang-based Chint Group, China\\'s leading industrial electrical equipment and new-energy enterprise in the private sector, is pushing forward its overseas mergers and acquisitions. At the same time, it is forging cooperation agreements on production capacity and equipment manufacturing along the Belt and Road Initiative. \"We are going to make more acquisitions to complete a whole industrial chain,\" says Nan Cunhui, chairman and founder.   An engineer monitors the automated production line at Chint Group\\'s photovoltaic components factory in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province. Shi Xiaofeng / China Daiy  Founded in 1984, Chint Group has seen its businesses expand over the years, from electrical equipment to power transmission and distribution equipment and services, instruments and meters, building appliances, photovoltaic power generation and equipment manufacture. In October, the company signed a comprehensive strategic cooperation agreement with Veolia, the world\\'s largest environmental services provider, covering almost all of Chint\\'s industrial chain across new energy, power transmission and distribution. Its international business has seen explosive growth for a year, especially in the field of new energy. For instance, Chint\\'s solar components factory in Malaysia started mass production in January. It is the company\\'s third components factory after those in China and Germany. In March, Chint completed two PV power plant projects in Thailand. It also drew up a plan to build one more components factory in the country to expand its business. So far, it has established factories, R&D centers and marketing branches in about 80 countries in Europe, North America, Russia, South America, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region. It constructed more than 30 overseas ground PV power plants, and sold its products to over 130 countries and regions. Its PV business grew by 80 percent last year; its power electronics products sector in the North American market grew by 168 percent; and the domestic and overseas general contract business grew by 425 percent. According to Nan, Chint\\'s chairman, the company has benefited from its acquisition of Conergy, a German PV company. At the time, the latter was on the verge of bankruptcy. Chint acquired its components factory in 2014. \"We had a very efficient circulation network. We sold the products from our German factory to the Asian market. The factory runs well now,\" says Nan. The acquisition provided a chance for the Chint to introduce the German factory\\'s management systems and automation production lines into its manufacturing bases in China, South Korea, Japan, India, the US, Spain, Thailand and Malaysia. This helped to increase production efficiency. \"Now, six engineers can operate the whole process at one workshop, whereas just two years ago, we had to use dozens of workers to complete all the work,\" says Lu Chuan, CEO of Chint New Energy, a subsidiary of Chint Group. \"We can even monitor the manufacturing process at factories in different countries from our headquarters.\" To meet the needs of domestic and overseas markets, Chint Group funnels 3 to 10 percent of its sales revenues into R&D each year. In its high-end equipment sector, the R&D investment reached 50 percent of its sales revenues. Last year, Chint launched China\\'s largest PV power plant project, a 2 billion yuan ($294 billion; 278 billion euros; 233 billion) 200 megawatt light project to complement local agriculture, at a mountainous area in rural Quzhou, Zhejiang province. shixiaofeng@chinadaily.com.cn ( China Daily European Weekly 12/16/2016 page28)'],\n",
       " ['Recruiting overseas needs knack for diversity nan Chinese enterprises need to think globally about their mergers and acquisitions - and not only about the market but about talent, says Ya-Qin Zhang, president of Baidu Inc, at the 3rd Conference on China Outbound Forum in Sanya, Hainan province. Hiring talent is always a tough but unavoidable issue for all overseas investors. Bosses have to consider whether talented people from abroad are willing to move to another country, especially when they are not familiar with the language and local culture. Zhang shared his experience recruiting globally for Baidu, the world largest Chinese search engine. \"We definitely want people to choose to live in Beijing, Shanghai or Shenzhen because it\\'s convenient to work together,\" Zhang says. \"But there are reasons that hold them back\" - for example, a family is settled in one place and may be reluctant to move. Baidu finds there is a strong demand to set up labs and recruit teams globally. It set up a research and development center for artificial intelligence and unmanned ground vehicles in Silicon Valley, in California, because many kinds of talent the company needs are concentrated there. \"Among those we can attract, half of them may be Chinese who work for Google, Microsoft or Amazon,\" Zhang says. \"But half may be Americans.\" Huawei Technologies, with more than 70,000 employees of different nationalities, has a model for recruiting talent abroad. It has established joint research programs with more than 150 universities around the world, hiring local experts and researchers for Huawei\\'s global expansion. \"There is no boundary for innovation,\" says David Harmon, vice-president for global public affairs at Huawei. \"So we focus a lot on cooperation in different markets to attract the best talent.\" Different from the domestic market, in which most everyone shares a language and cultural background, overseas M&As face communication challenges in a multicultural context. Yu Weiping, vice-president of CRRC Corp, used one of Wanda Group\\'s acquisitions as a case in point. When Wanda acquired AMC Entertainment, the parent company hired people who had studied or worked in China to reform the management team and run the business in the US. Those people, who were familiar with Chinese culture and understood the American business model, successfully transformed AMC from losing to gaining. \"Chinese international students brought in the business ideas and management models of those multinational enterprises,\" says Liu Ke, dean of the Institute of Clean Energy at South University of Science and Technology of China. \"But in the next 30 years, another mission for them is to bring our company to the world.\" ( China Daily European Weekly 12/16/2016 page25)'],\n",

       " ['Earthquake opened door for telecom giant nan When damage to undersea cables cut service to Europe, partnership followed In December 2006, the Hengchun earthquake off the south coast of Taiwan disrupted five submarine cables, cutting off the internet connection between Europe and Asia. Keen to keep its customers connected, British Telecom asked China Telecom for help. \"BT asked us to provide connections between London and Hong Kong within a week, and we only took half of that time,\" says Charlie Cao, managing director of China Telecom Europe. China Telecom was able to provide BT with this service thanks to its extensive terrestrial and submarine cable networks linking Europe with Asia. When natural disasters like earthquakes affect cables, data transfer can still be achieved by rerouting it.   - China Telecom\\'s team at the opening of the company\\'s Paris office in 2013. Provided to China Daily  During the Hengchun earthquake, China Telecom\\'s trans-Russian network was not affected, which made the service for BT possible. \"We have a higher numbers of cables compared with our Chinese competitors and we also provide efficient, direct and flexible services when transferring data across countries through these cables,\" says Cao. The BT partnership in 2006 was one of China Telecom\\'s first tasks in Europe, as the company established a European footprint by setting up a subsidiary in London that year.    With a decade of history in Europe under its belt, China Telecom is already a networking supplier to most major European telecommunications giants, including British Telecom, Vodafone, Telefonica, Deutsche Telekom and Orange. China Telecom\\'s history goes back to 1994, when the government established a company in Beijing that owned and controlled all public telecommunications, including mobile, fixed-line and postal services. Over the years China Telecom underwent a series of changes and restructuring, the most significant of which was in 2000, which led to the establishment of the company China Telecom Corp as it is known today. China Telecom has been listed on the Hong Kong and New York City stock exchanges since 2002. In 2000, China Telecom also started to expand overseas by establishing a representative office in the US. Over the years it expanded overseas, mainly across Europe, the Americas, Africa and the Middle East. In 2012, a new company called China Telecom Global was established. In an effort to better integrate its resources, all of the company\\'s overseas offices are integrated into China Telecom Global, which is headquartered in Hong Kong.    China Telecom\\'s European expansion has grown rapidly since 2006 and now the company has subsidiaries across countries in Europe, including in Germany, France, Russia, Belarus and Turkey. It also has representative offices in a handful or other countries, including Benelux, Italy, Poland, Czech Republic, Portugal, Spain and Hungary. Its equipment is installed in a half-dozen additional cities to facilitate communication, including Helsinki, Stockholm, Milan, Madrid and Istanbul. \"Geography is a key advantage we enjoy,\" Cao says. To connect between Europe and Asia, ground-based cables need to go through China, Kazakhstan, Mongolia or Russia; therefore China Telecom\\'s headquarters location in China gives it an advantage over Western telecommunications firms in rolling out such cables. Compared with terrestrial cables, submarine cables are more prone to disruptions, and are more difficult to repair when they are broken. China Telecom\\'s European expansion plays a supportive role for Chinese companies in Europe, as these firms often need to send data back to their headquarters at very fast speeds or hold video conferences with colleagues in China or other international offices. Its corporate clients are now spread across industries including finance, manufacturing, retail, gaming and high technology firms. \"Once they are connected onto our network, they can enjoy global communication across more than 60 data points and 33 cables globally,\" Cao says. China Telecom is also now increasingly providing corporate services to Western companies, especially those requiring communication with China. \"Before our entrance into Europe, many of these corporate clients were served by Western carriers. Most major Western carriers entered the Chinese market by partnering with Chinese firms like us, but now that we\\'re going global we are competing with them to expand our client base,\" says Cao. The roll-out of China Telecom\\'s cable infrastructure between Asia and Europe means many Western clients can enjoy the same services. Compared with Western telecommunications firms, the company has \"more flexibility and quicker responses to clients\\' needs on a regular basis\", Cao says. In addition to serving corporate clients, China Telecom also launched a dual-number SIM card service in 2012, targeting retail clients, who are mostly business travelers or overseas Chinese.    Known as CTExcelBiz, this SIM card allows clients in the UK and Europe to make and receive calls with local numbers and Chinese numbers at local service rates. Currently there are 20,000 such cards in use in the UK, and an additional 20,000 in France. The SIM card issued in France has two versions, one focusing on usage in France, and the second on customers frequently traveling to other continental European countries by providing cheap roaming services. In addition to facilitating calls, the card also supports mobile payment activities using Alipay and Wechat Pay, as both apps can only support Chinese mobile phone numbers. With a decade of history in the UK, China Telecom has also developed a unique corporate culture, characterized by placing strong emphasis on customer trust, thinking from the customer\\'s perspective and respect for contracts. \"We try to build strong trust with our customers. We are honest when doing business with them. We do not over-emphasize our abilities and we do not make promises for things we cannot deliver,\" says Cao of China Telecom. Thinking from the customer\\'s perspective often does not necessarily mean providing them with the most expensive package of products, Cao says. \"If we realize they do not require a service package with such great speed or bandwidth, we will recommend a more cost-efficient package that will still satisfy their needs.\" Looking to the future, Cao says his team will increase geographical reach with its services, broaden service range and venture into new business areas like cloud technology and smart technology. \"Currently we\\'ve established quite a presence in Western European countries like the UK, France and Germany, but we still see many more opportunities in the Scandinavian countries, in Portugal, Spain and Turkey,\" Cao says. Cao says his team would also like to broaden its services for corporate clients, and in particular supply ICT (integration communication technology) systems to Chinese companies coming to the UK and Europe. ICT systems refer to a package of telecommunications services that satisfy a Chinese company\\'s needs in a comprehensive way. \"In addition, we would like to explore opportunities to provide cloud and smart cities technologies. For example, a lot of cloud technology may encounter firewall challenges in China, and we could contribute toward overcoming these technical barriers,\" says Cao. His team is already exploring cloud technology opportunities in partnership with Alibaba Cloud, Google, Amazon and Microsoft. cecily.liu@mail.chinadailyuk.com (China Daily European Weekly 12/16/2016 page30)'],\n",
       " ['Wanda chief: China must create channels for culture export nan Creating communication channels and famous brands are two key factors that will help Chinese culture to be better understood by the rest of the world, says China\\'s richest businessman, Wang Jianlin, chairman of Dalian Wanda Group. Wang says China\\'s movie industry, television and print media all have a shortage of delivery channels for communicating with the overseas market and making themselves understood. He spoke during the 2016 China Entrepreneur Summit, hosted by China Entrepreneur magazine earlier in December. \"It is just as if you want to drive, you need first to build highways,\" he says. \"If you want the outside world to understand more about Chinese culture, you need to build the communicating channels first to send the cultural products overseas. \" Wanda has been aggressively seeking acquisitions and partnerships with Hollywood studios in the past few years, and its overseas business has been focusing mainly on the cultural industry. It already owns AMC Theaters, and it purchased Legendary Entertainment for $3.5 billion (3.2 billion euros; 2.7 billion) early this year. Wang expanded on the movie industry example, noting that there are a large number of movie companies in the world. In the US market there are more than 3,000 independent film production companies, but only six of them have global distribution channels and well-known brands.    Does the ability of China\\'s movies to go overseas depend on the channels of these six companies? Wang\\'s answer is no. China needs to build its own channels, he says. The Chinese movie box office has doubled where it was three years ago in the domestic market, but in overseas markets it has been rare to see an up-tick over the past few years, he says. He attributes it to a lack of global distribution channels. But good channels are not enough, he says. China needs to cultivate big leading companies in the cultural industry that have brands that are famous globally, such as Disneyland. \"The US is not only strong economically, but also culturally. Its biggest export is culture,\" he says. \"Cultural industry output accounts for about 24 percent of the US GDP.\" In China, the cultural industry\\'s output accounted for only about 4 percent of GDP last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Wang says that at present China is still far away from being able to put a label on its culture, and it will take a long time before people understand that. The sizes of Chinese companies are quite small, and there are no big companies with a famous name. \"If China could cultivate about 10 cultural companies with annual income of tens of billions dollars, maybe our culture would play a leading role in world cultural exchanges,\" he says. He adds that Chinese companies like Wanda could be a primary force in taking Chinese culture global. Wang says the central government should be more supportive of the cultural industry, as in China most are small and find it difficult to compete with global companies. Wang says he conducted some research in France because he was confused why French movies could be influential in the world - for example, its Cannes International Film Festival is both famous and prestigious worldwide. \"I came to understand that this is because the French realized a long time ago that if they don\\'t support French movies, then their market will be occupied by English movies. So when they shoot a French movie, the government provides a lot of subsidiaries,\" he says. chenyingqun@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/16/2016 page26)'],\n",
       " ['Gasoline, diesel prices rise nan Increase was triggered by output cuts announced by OPEC and other oil-producing countries China just saw its biggest gasoline and diesel price increase in the past four years, with prices driven up by the output cuts of OPEC and other producers. Gasoline and diesel prices were hiked by 435 yuan ($63; 60 euros; 50) and 420 yuan per metric ton, respectively, according to an announcement by the National Development and Reform Commission on Dec 14. It was the 24th price adjustment of this year. National average retail prices rose by 0.32 yuan (for 90-octane gasoline) and 0.36 yuan (for diesel) per liter. The prices have been fluctuating around 5 yuan per liter since the beginning of this year. For a car with a 50-liter fuel tank, it will cost another 16-20 yuan to get a full tank. This is the ninth fuel price hike in China so far this year. Last week, OPEC and 11 non-OPEC countries, including Russia, agreed to cut 1.8 million barrels of crude oil output per day within six months, starting from January. The output curb has pushed up international oil prices. As of Dec 13, the WTI crude price increased by $1.33 per barrel to $52.83 per barrel, compared with Nov 30 when OPEC announced the output cut. The price of Brent crude increased by $1.36 per barrel to $55.69 per barrel. Both have reached their highest level so far this year. Li Li, an analyst with ICIS China, says that global oil prices are unlikely to surpass $60 per barrel in the short run. \"International oil prices are expected to fluctuate between $55 and $60 per barrel. Output in China is not expected to increase much because the capacity that has been shut down is mostly outdated and from small facilities. The general expectation is that oil prices are not going to surge. The effect on the consumer price index is also limited,\" Li says. The last major price hike was in October, with an increase of 340 yuan and 355 yuan per ton for gasoline and diesel, also driven by the output limitation announced by OPEC at the end of September. \"OPEC has achieved its goal of an oil price hike by shedding some market share. This has also created good opportunities for the US oil industry to recover. Moreover, Rex Tillerson, the chief executive officer of ExxonMobil Corp, has just been appointed as the next US secretary of state, which will add impetus to the country\\'s oil industry,\" says Li. Zou Yanan, an analyst with SCI International, says that retailers in central, southwestern and northwestern parts of China have been limiting sales due to the tight supply of gasoline and diesel. yangziman@chinadaily.com.cn   - A worker helps refuel a car at a gas station in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, on Dec 14.

Stratospheric housing prices in the metropolis are forcing developers to downsize high-end properties to make them more affordable. \"Shanghai\\'s luxury real estate market today is replicating the story of Hong Kong,\" says the Shanghai office of Hong Kong-listed China Overseas Land and Investment Ltd. \"Buyers are accepting the idea that luxury homes can have a floor space of 100 square meters, a frustrating reality that Hong Kong people have long lived with.\"   - Smaller luxury homes could become a trend in Shanghai. Xu Haifeng / For China Daily  Sky-high home prices are pressing builders in Shanghai to redefine just how big a luxury property should be. The average price of a 90-square-meter home is about 25 times average household income. More than two years ago, luxury homes with a floor area ranging from 250 to 400 square meters were commonplace for the company in Shanghai. However, with housing fever showing no sign of cooling down over the past two years, the state-owned developer has been compelled to control selling prices by trimming sizes to 200-210 or 130-140 square meters. As of November, the average price of flats in Shanghai had reached 50,000 yuan ($7,278; 6,885 euros; 5,785) per square meter, while houses priced at no more than 100,000 yuan per square meter can hardly be labeled as luxury. Upgraders who are in a hurry to replace their small apartments with better accommodation, have been the mainstay of purchasers. The hard fact is that the seemingly endless escalation of Shanghai\\'s home costs is lowering people\\'s expectations for living space.    A batch of luxury flats in downtown Shanghai, 100 square meters in size and valued at 10 million yuan each, has proven to be highly sought-after. China Overseas says smaller luxury homes could well be a long-term trend, as Shanghai is poised to emerge as a mega city in the foreseeable future, dwarfing its peers like New York, London and Tokyo, both in terms of city size and housing prices. \"There is a big chance for overall home prices in Shanghai to surpass those of Hong Kong. So it would be safe to say that house-buying costs in Shanghai will see room to climb.\" Although policymakers in the world\\'s second-largest economy are grappling to cool the red-hot real estate market in first-tier cities, the developer says the flurry of cooling measures is weeding out unregulated, highly indebted properties, rather than dealing a blow to normal demand. This has made the company reiterate its confidence in the coastal city\\'s property market. Demand on a nationwide level remains robust, which underlines price sustainability, four Harvard academics wrote in a working paper last month. This is in part because buyers are not highly indebted, tend to invest for the long term and are unlikely to sell houses even if prices drop. luoweiteng@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/16/2016 page28)'],\n",
       " ['Real estate prices settling into stable pattern nan To buy or not to buy - that is the question for Hu Chengru, 39, a prospective homebuyer in Shanghai. Hu had realized some 3.6 million yuan ($529,000; 503,000 euros; 421,000) from the sale of her old apartment earlier this year. Now, she would like to buy a more spacious flat for \"upgrading\" the quality of her life. But she is still waiting for the right time to buy. \"Every day, I ask whoever I think may have some knowledge about the real estate market: \\'Will home prices drop in Shanghai?\\' \"Their answers have ranged from \\'Definitely not\\' two months ago to the currently \\'Perhaps\\',\" Hu says. In key cities like Beijing and Shanghai, home prices are less likely to drop significantly, but the pace of the rise has slowed, analysts say. \"One major reason there\\'s little chance of a sharp fall in home prices in key cities is the great demand as reflected by demographic data,\" says Liu Ligang, an economist at Citibank China. \"Some 70 million residents are entering the age of getting married, having children or having a second child, and urbanization-related migrants also need housing in cities. Without new developments, some cities may exhaust their current inventories in just nine months. Supply of land is limited. Considering all these factors, home prices in key cities are not likely to drop significantly.\" The average price of apartments may not drop significantly but transaction volume may shrink to 40 percent in the first half of 2017, in immediate response to measures against speculative buying, says Zhang Yu, an analyst at investment banker CICC Ltd. \"In first- and second-tier cities, demand from speculators has been curbed after policy tightening, so transaction volume will shrink, but the average price won\\'t decline because land prices are high and demand is still solid and increasing, while supply is short,\" Zhang wrote in a research note. In third- and lower-tier cities, particularly those neighboring key cities, prices may rise slightly around 10 percent, which would be natural and rational, Zhang says. A research note from Guotai Junan Securities cites financing conditions as a factor for stable growth of the real estate sector. The note further says monetary policies have not been tightened much, which gives the real estate sector spacious room to grow. Also, as a pillar of economic growth, real estate is not likely to face significant downward pressure if the overall economic growth is positive. Economists says that uncertainty remains, including changes to policies, the pace of urbanization and investment growth. Market corrections, if any, will be mild. Wang Tao, an economist with UBS Securities, says policymakers would not like to see a significant decline in the real estate market because that would impact overall economic growth. \"Construction and investment recover mildly and slowly, so even if the real estate market sees pressure, it will not decline as it did two years ago,\" Wang says.

       " ['Chinese overseas investment patterns evolving nan In contrast to years ago, more outbound investment is flowing into the manufacturing and IT industries, experts told a recent outbound investment forum. From January to October, Chinese companies had a cumulative direct investment of $145.96 billion (137 billion euros; 115.3 billion) overseas, with year-on-year growth of 53.3 percent, according to the latest report provided by China\\'s Ministry of Commerce. According to a report released by the ministry, $17.59 billion of outbound investment was injected into the manufacturing industry in the first half-year of 2016, with year-on-year growth of 245.6 percent. The change of focus comes from the maturing of China\\'s economy, says Luo Xiaojun, co-founder of Morning Whistle, a merger and acquisition consultancy.   - Long Yongtu, former vice-minister of commerce, spoke at the forum on Dec 2. Provided to China Daily  \"In the early days, China focused more on investing resources to fulfill the needs of manufacturing,\" he says. \"We simply produced and exported to the global market while the advanced technologies were still out there.\" As China undergoes economic restructuring, Chinese manufacturers need to update technology and expand their markets. Chinese enterprises prefer to obtain advanced technology and a position in overseas markets through mergers and acquisitions rather than independent research and development, which is costly and time-consuming. From January to September, Chinese enterprises spent $64.44 billion on mergers and acquisitions, $10 billion more than the total amount for last year, according to data provided by the Ministry of Commerce. Manufacturing and information technology are the top two industries, with investment of $16.10 billion and $15.48 billion respectively. Mergers and acquisitions can help companies to obtain technology, patents and talent, and to enter a new market within short time, Yu Weiping, vice-president of CRRC Corp, told the 3rd Conference of China Outbound Forum, held from Dec 2 to 3. Through acquisition, domestic enterprises can also increase their influence by acquiring well-known brands to promote their products and services in both overseas and home markets. \"Overseas acquisition is a way we can narrow the gap between us and the developed countries,\" said Long Yongtu, former vice-minister of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (now called the Ministry of Commerce), at the forum. Private enterprises have done a better job in terms of acquisitions, say experts. According to data from the Center for China Globalization, private enterprises made 290 mergers and acquisitions, accounting for 64 percent of all reported deals. Relative independence gives private capital more flexibility to put its money where it is required. Private enterprises\\' rapid decision-making allows them to act efficiently, says Qian Jiannong, vice-president of Fosun Group. He also pointed out that if they encounter problems they can change and reform quickly. Unlike state-owned businesses, private ones can use overseas funds and capital to invest in acquisitions. When private enterprises become international companies, the way they use their funds is not restricted by local policies or rules, leaving more space for the companies to invest. \"I feel foreign companies and governments are willing to cooperate with our private enterprises,\" Qian says. \"I believe there are great prospects for private enterprises in the international expansion process in the future.\" liuxuan@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/16/2016 page25)'],\n",
       " ['UnionPay cards expanding globally nan More countries rush to accept the increasingly popular payment method as they bid to attract more customers One of the largest global bankcard associations, UnionPay, is fast expanding its overseas networks to facilitate convenient payment services for Chinese outbound travelers, with the goal of rivaling Western banking giants Visa and MasterCard. With a network spanning over 2.2 million merchants across 39 European countries, UnionPay\\'s expansion momentum is demonstrated by the high-profile partnerships signed in November with the Czech Republic\\'s largest commercial bank, Ceska Sporitelna, France\\'s Louvre Hotels Group and Portugal\\'s main card processing firm, Unicre.   The Unionpay advertisement at Copenhagen Airport in Denmark. Provided to China Daily  \"Europe is significant to UnionPay\\'s internationalization strategy. At present, UnionPay\\'s acceptance environment keeps improving both online and offline, and more types of merchants are accepting UnionPay cards, \" says Cai Jianbo, CEO of UnionPay International. Cai adds that the expansion supports increasing international collaboration between China and other countries and regions, as well as the exchange of personnel, by providing users with an improved customer experience and secure, convenient payment services. UnionPay was founded in 2002 with a view toward enabling interbank payment transactions in China. The company began to expand overseas in 2004, which later led to the founding of its subsidiary, UnionPay International.  Despite its short history, UnionPay has quickly expanded to now being accepted in 160 countries and regions. It is now the world\\'s third-largest payment network by value of transactions processed, behind only Visa and MasterCard, according to November statistics compiled by the US research service BI Intelligence. Once entering a Western country, UnionPay\\'s acceptance rate grows quickly, and here the statistics speak for themselves. For example, UnionPay\\'s acceptance rate by local merchants is 90 percent in Denmark, 70 percent in Spain, and 60 percent in the Netherlands. Almost all ATMs in Switzerland, Austria and Iceland, and more than 80 percent of local ATMs in Italy, Spain and Greece accept UnionPay cards. One unique advantage for UnionPay is domestic market strength, as UnionPay is currently the only interbank network in Chinese mainland that connects all of the ATMs of all banking companies throughout China. UnionPay\\'s international growth is helped a lot by booming outbound tourist numbers. Chinese outbound tourists exceeded 59 million in the first half of 2016, and China is the largest tourist source for many countries including Thailand, Japan, South Korea, the Maldives, Russia, and the UK. For this reason, overseas retailers keen to attract high spending Chinese tourists have all accepted UnionPay, ranging from London\\'s department store Harrods to Swiss jeweler Beyer, to the British hotel chain IHG.  Markus Baumgartner, sales director at Beyer, says working with UnionPay greatly improved Beyer\\'s access to Chinese shoppers, and now 20 to 30 percent of revenue at Beyer\\'s Swiss shops are processed through UnionPay. \"Payments we receive through UnionPay always come quickly and efficiently, and customers using UnionPay cards never experience payment issues. They\\'re a great partner to work with,\" Baumgartner says. Pierre-Frederic Roulot, president of Louvre Hotels Group, says of Chinese tourists: \"We want to provide as much convenience as possible. Benefiting from the strategic cooperation with UnionPay International, we will be able to enhance our service quality and improve payment services for Chinese tourists.\" UnionPay cards are now accepted across the group\\'s six major hotel brands, which include 1,100 hotels in 51 countries and regions. At the beginning of next year, UnionPay cards will be accepted by the group\\'s 200 self-operated hotels, and then will be expanded across its 500 franchised hotels. One factor behind UnionPay\\'s fast international expansion is its partnerships with Western payment systems, so UnionPay can leverage those partners\\' existing networks. Portugal\\'s Unicre is a good example, as the partnership allowed UnionPay\\'s member cards to be accepted by all ATMs in the country. \"Accepting UnionPay helps merchants attract customers, and thus realize an all-win result,\" says Luis Flores, CEO of Unicre. Another example is Six Payment Services of Switzerland, which began processing UnionPay transactions in 2006. \"Chinese customers are a very important target group especially for merchants in the tourism and luxury business. We are, therefore, highly interested in enabling smooth payments for UnionPay cardholders at any of our merchants, be it on-site or, in the future, online,\" says Roger Niederer, head of merchant services at Six Payment. Niederer adds that in the future his team also wants to work with UnionPay on ecommerce payments, so UnionPay card holders can shop online or book hotels in Europe. In addition to facilitating easy payments, UnionPay also helped Bank of China with the issuance of the first European travel-oriented card in November, giving high-spending Chinese tourists an easy payment option that can be promoted to more than 100,000 merchants in 32 European countries, riding on a wave of innovative financial solutions targeting Chinese travelers. This new card fits into Bank of China\\'s Travel Mate Credit Card program, which has already issued about 2 million cards targeting Chinese people traveling to countries including South Korea, Japan and the US, all of which have payments facilitated by UnionPay. Xu Luode, executive vice-president of the Bank of China, says the new card is a good solution given the concern that the rate of growth of Chinese shopping in Europe is now slowing, compared with the high growth of previous years. \"We combine premium European merchants and their promotions into our card offerings. So we say to our customers, there are good products and services in Europe; you should come here,\" Xu says. Cai says that his team will work to strengthen technical support for UnionPay users, and help Chinese travelers get better promotional packages in Europe. Brands Bucherer and Beyer are examples of the first batch of retailers to sign up the card with unique promotional offers. Another key discount opportunity UnionPay offered its users is its \"50 Selected Business Districts\" campaign, a package designed for the New Year and the Chinese Spring Festival. Since December, about 1,000 stores in 50 popular business districts worldwide are offering exclusive discounts for UnionPay cardholders. In Europe, participating merchants include Roger & Gallet, Lancel, Le BHV Marais, La Rinascente Duomo, El Corte Ingles, the Style Outlets and nine Value Retail Outlets. The increasing use of renminbi payment for overseas purchases - facilitated by initiatives like the new Bank of China travel card - also fits into the wider trend of RMB internationalization, according to Cui Zhijian, an associate professor of operations management at IE Business School in Spain. \"In the long term, such initiatives will facilitate the internationalization of the renminbi and enhance the position of the Chinese financial industry in the world market,\" Cui says. UnionPay\\'s services are warmly embraced by customers. \"I try to use my UnionPay card whenever I can, instead of a Visa card,\" says Chen Yixin, a Shanghai student who visited the UK for a four-week summer study program in July. \"I\\'ve used UnionPay in many tax-free shops in London. It\\'s simple and secure to use,\" Chen says. cecily.liu@mail.chinadailyuk.com ( China Daily European Weekly 12/16/2016 page29)'],\n",
       " ['What\\'s up with the money, doc? nan Doctor\\'s wealth disclosure has raised eyebrows - but aren\\'t these lifesavers worth more? Ren Liming is a urologist at the Second People\\'s Hospital in Chengdu, Sichuan province. He was thrust into the limelight when he posted a photo of a down jacket he just bought - with an eye-popping price tag of 10,000 yuan ($1,400; 1,324 euros; 1,112). Some were amazed by his flaunting of personal wealth. They thought people in the healthcare industry should keep a low profile because of the long-standing tension between doctors and patients in China. Many doctors have been accused of taking cash gifts from patients or their families - to the point that they represent a significant part of their income.    Admittedly, Ren\\'s expensive jacket, together with the revelation that he makes 1 million yuan a year, raised the suspicion that his lavish lifestyle is built on this so-called gray income. Just as he was supposed to be shedding tears of remorse for his outburst of vanity, Ren came forward and divulged more personal information to a local reporter. He owns three properties and about one-fifth of his annual income - 200,000 yuan - is from his day job at the hospital, and he spends it on clothing alone. He derives other income from online consulting and offline teaching, practicing medicine in other places and making healthcare-related investments. The purpose of \"spilling the beans\", he says, is to instill pride in young professionals who are just entering the business. He says many of his peers in the top echelon make as much as he does, or even more. He also addresses the sensitive topic of \"gray income\", saying that if your legal earnings are high enough, you have no incentive to take bribes. But I suspect that his real motive is to promote his businesses and his personal name. Now that he is the best-known urologist in the city, requests for consultations will go through the roof, I imagine. Which is not wrong - just a bit unconventional. Ren may have been exploiting the nation\\'s hate-the-rich mentality for his own good. China has come full circle from \"To get rich is glorious\" in the 1980s to \"You\\'d better lie low if you\\'re filthy rich because the whirlwinds of envy will sweep you away\". The internet has magnified the wealth gap, with websites incessantly hyping the lifestyles of the rich and then following up with blanket hatred of that high-profile demographic. In recent years the voice of reason has spoken up, arguing that the key is not how much wealth one has but how that wealth was accumulated, legally, ethically or otherwise. A tricky point of debate is the so-called original sin, which refers to the often less-than-upright way the first pot of gold was made - a sin that\\'s said to tarnish many private entrepreneurs. For years Chen Guangbiao was China\\'s most conspicuous spender. He would stack up a wall of bills and take photos with it. He claimed to be a big philanthropist but has turned out to be a big showman, who used philanthropy as a means to ingratiate himself in circles of power. I\\'m not discounting the desperate need for vulgarian excess that characterizes the nouveau riche, but when the flaunting gets too tacky it arouses suspicion that there\\'s more than vanity at work. Maybe someone of Guo Meimei\\'s age doesn\\'t think twice before posting expensive purchases made possible by a rich sugar daddy, but a mature entrepreneur would probably resist the temptation unless he or she is totally isolated from the internet culture. Guo almost singlehandedly ruined the reputation of the Red Cross when she gave herself a title affiliated with the organization and posted pictures of luxury items. I don\\'t know if Ren\\'s comment that many of his peers make as much as he does is accurate. A few years ago, I went on a trip to Africa with a dozen healthcare professionals who were offering free medical services for treating cataracts. I learned firsthand that most of them did not make as much as Ren. I did a search and found a 2015 survey on Dxy.cn, a medical information site. It surveyed 30,000 doctors nationwide and concluded that the average annual salary was 77,000 yuan, and 74 percent of the doctors were not satisfied. If this figure is accurate and can be extrapolated to the whole country, it confirms my impression that doctors in China are far from enviable - not only compared with their counterparts in developed countries but with professionals in other Chinese industries such as finance. Considering the higher-than-normal investment in education and training, their incomes can be said to be on the lower end of the social spectrum. The primary reason the incomes of Chinese doctors do not reflect their status or market demand is that the rates for medical services in China are highly regulated. It costs only a couple of yuan to see a doctor, so even if a doctor treats 100 patients a day it does not add up to much. To subsidize the cost of the counseling, hospitals add a heavy markup to prescribed drugs. These practices are rooted in the good intention of offering a nearly free service to everyone, but they have led to less-than-desirable results. For example, some people flock to the best hospitals for something as innocuous as a common cold. Meanwhile, both patients and pharmaceutical sales representatives dangle big bribes in front of doctors, which is the market\\'s way of \"correcting\" the reality of doctors being seriously underpaid. Whenever there is a complaint against the medical profession, people cite United States doctors as role models. But they tend to forget that US doctors are paid 15 times as much. It is pretty hard for anyone to keep up a good attitude when 100 patients are squeezed into one shift. Everyone wants free or nearly free healthcare that is also good quality. Few see the irony in this. A government should help those in need - the poor who cannot afford expensive medical services. But if it makes healthcare affordable by artificially depressing incomes in the profession, it is tantamount to driving away future talent. In that sense, Ren has become a lightning rod, even though his solution may not be applicable across the industry.

       " ['Goodall: Our brains can save us nan Champion of environment believes intelligence is humans\\' greatest asset in fighting threat of devastation Bees can use tools. So can birds. Octopuses can slither out of tanks, slink into others to gobble fish and squish back into their own, pulling the lid closed behind them - humans none the wiser, until they review surveillance footage. Clever creatures. Indeed.   Goodall looks at rescued chimpanzees in July at Sweetwaters, Kenya\\'s only great-ape sanctuary. Photos Provided to China Daily   Primatologist and environmentalist Jane Goodall speaks at the recent Beijing summit of the Roots & Shoots environmental-education program for youth run by her institute.   Especially considering that mollusks don\\'t have brains, per se. This, says Jane Goodall, the household-name primatologist who discovered that chimps use tools, makes it an amazing time for humanity\\'s next generation to study animals. And human intelligence can be the instrument by which we blunt ecological devastation, the Briton believes. Goodall realized decades ago, upon observing the apes modifying natural objects to manipulate their environment - for instance, using sticks to extract insects from the earth - that we needed to \"redefine man, redefine tool or include chimpanzees with humans\". So, science did. \"It was very exciting for me because I was the first to learn about chimpanzees,\" she says. But revolutionary discoveries about animal intelligence are generating new paradigms. \"In 1960, if I said to the professors, \\'Let\\'s study the intelligence of the octopus\\', they would have laughed at me and locked me up as an insane person,\" she says. \"Now, there\\'s huge interest because octopuses are incredibly intelligent, and they can solve problems. Crows ... can make tools. They can do things even some primates can\\'t.\" But experts for decades believed birds\\' dissimilar brain structures meant they weren\\'t capable of intelligence, she points out. \"So, it\\'s a very exciting time for young people to go out there and learn about animals.\" Bumblebees were recently taught to pull strings to earn a reward. More strikingly, others replicated the procedure after observing it, she points out. Goodall, who made the journey to Tanzania\\'s forests as a young woman without formal training, is celebrated for revolutionizing our understanding of our species\\' closest kin. But her methods weren\\'t without criticism, especially giving names rather than numbers. Numbers \"make them objects of study rather than living beings\", she says. So, to me it\\'s very, very important, if it\\'s possible, to know them as individuals, to name them and describe them.\" They may not be people, yet they have individual personalities. They share emotions like joy and sadness, she discovered. They\\'re capable of empathy. Goodall first documented chimp warfare. \"It\\'s not only learning about the primate but also learning from the primate. There\\'s a difference,\" she explains. \"It\\'s more a humility. I have a lot to learn.\" Goodall left the chimpanzees she loved decades ago - to save them. She saw, while flying over Tanzania\\'s Gombe in the early 1990s, that deforestation had shaved surrounding forests bald. That changed everything. She realized: \"You cannot do animal conservation unless you do people conservation.\" Protecting nature requires sustainable development that produces solutions for humans who share other species\\' habitats, she understood. Goodall soon after led the successful movement to reforest the area and improve local residents\\' living standards. But her battle is global. The 82-year-old environmentalist, anthropologist and United Nations Messenger of Peace spends more than 300 days a year jetting around the world as an advocate. What started as a mission to save the chimpanzees turned into a journey to improve life for all living things. Roots & Shoots, an environmental-education program for youth run by the Jane Goodall Institute, has 150,000 members in 130 countries and regions, and 700 groups on the Chinese mainland. \"My hope for Roots & Shoots is to create a critical mass of young people who understand the importance of the natural world - for humans as well as wildlife - and a group of people who understand that, while we need money to live, it starts to go wrong when we live for money,\" she tells China Daily. \"But it\\'s really young people who understand that economic development at the expense of the environment is a death knell, if it goes on like this, for the children of the future. That\\'s worldwide.\" Goodall says she has seen vast changes in Chinese children\\'s mentality since she started coming to the country three decades ago. Adults are following suit. \"China is already beginning to do a lot. In some cases, it\\'s a world leader in things like solar technology,\" Goodall says. \"The big problem in China is air pollution.\" She says China has done better than many countries on climate change, especially regarding the Paris Agreement, which it signed. But the world needs more, she believes. \"Some countries are really doing well. And other countries have signed it and are carrying on as usual or even worse - that\\'s not China.\" She\\'s impressed by a water-purification system in Sichuan province\\'s capital, Chengdu, that uses gravity to pull water through marshland plants that filter out contaminants. It doubles as a fish habitat. Wetlands as sieves proved a prominent theme among students\\' displays at the Beijing Roots & Shoots summit. Six primary schools in Jiangsu province\\'s Zhangjiagang distributed hand-drawn postcards of wetlands with handwritten descriptions of what they learned during field research. Dalian Minzu University student Wang Shuaiyu called the event - and meeting Goodall - \"very moving\". \"It\\'s a moment to celebrate all our environmental-protection projects,\" she says. Goodall told the crowd one of her sources of hope is \"our extraordinary brains\". \"It\\'s the explosive development of the human intellect that is the single greatest difference between us and chimpanzees, our closest animal relatives - and all other animals,\" she says. Beijing\\'s air pollution reminds her of London when she was growing up. \"It was the same in New York and Los Angeles. It was when people began to use their brains that we gradually made the difference.\" That, she believes, is still happening worldwide. \"You,\" she told the Beijing crowd, \"are my reason for hope.\" Contact the writer at erik_nilsson@chinadaily.com.cn ( China Daily European Weekly 12/16/2016 page21)'],\n",

The resort has already logged around 1 million visits. \"Visitors who drive their own cars are the biggest group so far,\" says Yang Guozhong, head of the Jintan Tourism Bureau. \"Most of them typically spend two days here, getting in touch with nature and soaking up Taoist culture.\" The resort is an hour\\'s drive from Nanjing and two hours from Shanghai. Accommodations is priced from 600 yuan to a little more than 1,200 yuan, including breakfast for two and entrance fees. Here, visitors can practice tai chi, enjoy organic food and take side trips to nearby villages. A museum showcases the history of Taoism over the past 5,000 years. The wall paintings and sculptures carved from wood are very delicate. Walking through the Maoshan mountain area, which forms part of the resort, is like being in a picture. Hotels and inns with gray tiles, white walls and wooden pillars line both sides of the main roads. They are typical of the architecture south of the Yangtze River. There are also waterfalls on the small stone mountains, on top of which lie gorgeous pavilions. Visitor numbers peaked during the summer vacation, when families of three to five members came to visit, says Yang Cuidi, an employee of the resort\\'s Xiangyun Hotel. \"We were fully booked during that time,\" Yang says. Interactive programs are offered to spice up the experience at the hotel. They include dumpling-making, painting, pottery, tea performances, calligraphy, music classes and vegetable planting. My group opted for a night mime at the Wuyang Theater. The hourlong show, starting at 8 pm, is about a young student learning Taoism and kung fu. The show is free for resort guests. It integrates Taoism and hip-pop elements and features young actors and actresses from China, Japan and South Korea. The stage effects and the actors\\' kung fu skills and synchronization with the music brought the house down. A multiple curtain projection created a 3-D effect, changing from Chinese ink painting to bright and colorful natural scenery. The audience can also get involved in certain sessions, such as jump-rope and qigong, a system of deep breathing exercises. The resort offers other recreational experiences as well. For example, there is a sky cinema, where visitors can watch Pan Gu, a film about the creator of the universe in Chinese mythology, who makes sky and earth out of primal chaos. Rafting is available in Kundi Valley, where visitors experience an ancient village setting with blooming shrubs and stone carvings. Kanshuifa is a themed water zone that invites visitors to ride bicycles and play with squirt guns, while the Lihuo Temple offers ancient totems and fire sacrifice performances. Drum beating and live-action performances are on offer at Zhenleichang. The drum is 3 meters in diameter and weighs 100 kilograms. The drumbeats literally spread to all corners of the site. Duiyanzang has a salt museum where visitors can experience salt-making and see traditional sacrificial dances done with salt. Our group was lucky: It snowed while we were there, which gave the area a white, quiet, holy aura. For someone who wants a change of pace from the city\\'s hustle and bustle, along with a slice of Taoist culture while relaxing with family and friends, this resort is a wonderful option. yangfeiyue@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/16/2016 page20)'],\n",
       " ['Fanning the flames of obsession nan The phrases you\\'ll need to tackle a severe case of celebrity worship If you have any interest at all in pop culture, you\\'ll have come across people like this: They are the most loyal champions any celebrity could wish for. They are, of course, the fans. But apart from debating the merits of their idols on social media and injecting billions of yuan into the media industry each year, they are also the fountainhead of a lot of internet slang. The word ç²\\x89ä¸\\x9d (fÄ\\x9bnsÄ«), literally \"rice noodles\", is the Chinese term for \"fans\" (say it out loud a few times to find out why). These days, there is a new expression - è¿·å¦¹ (m¨ªm¨¦i), literally \"obsessed sisters\", and its counterpart, \"obsessed brothers\" (è¿·å¼\\x9f, m¨ªdÃ¬), which are considered more accurate descriptions of the level of these individuals\\' mania.   - Chinese fans welcome Hollywood star Natalie Portman at the Beijing International Film Festival in April. Zhu Xingxin / China Daily  To shore up your credibility as an adoring fan, there are certain phrases you have to master in order to lavish praise on your idols, defend them to the hilt and swear eternal loyalty and love. As far as fans are concerned, their idols are perfect. To their admirers, all pop stars are good-looking, have good acting or singing skills, work hard and treat fans well. Complimenting the object of your admiration usually starts with appearance. First, you should learn the word é¢\\x9cå\\x80?(y¨¢nzh¨ª), literally meaning \"face value\". The better-looking someone is, the higher the face value. Here are two phrases that have been around for a while but can be very useful: é¢\\x9cå\\x80¼ç\\x88\\x86è¡?(y¨¢nzh¨ª bÃ\\xa0obiÇ\\x8eo), which means \"the face value has destroyed the charts\", and é¢\\x9cå\\x80¼é\\x80\\x86å¤© (y¨¢nzh¨ª nÃ¬tiÄ\\x81n), meaning \"the face value goes against the laws of nature\". Sometimes you see the four-character phrase ç¾\\x8eé¢\\x9cç\\x9b\\x9bä¸\\x96 (mÄ\\x9biy¨¢n sh¨¦ngshÃ¬), literally meaning \"beautiful face flourishing era\". Don\\'t question the meaning; these are simply four characters that are supposed to make you think of pleasant things, just like the beautiful object of your praise. Even more confusingly, there is \"the spring of the face dog (é¢\\x9cç\\x8b\\x97ç\\x9a\\x84æ\\x98¥å¤?y¨¢ngÇ\\x92u de chÅ«ntiÄ\\x81n)\". é¢\\x9cç\\x8b\\x97 literally means \"face dog\", a somewhat self-deprecating term to describe fans who only care about a pop star\\'s appearance. So, the logic goes, a face dog\\'s \"spring\" comes when they see many beautiful faces (i.e. they are happy). If the whole cast of the film is studded with handsome mugs, fans will exclaim: \"This movie is totally the spring of face dogs.\" You will also frequently see the word å\\x93?(kÅ«, cry). In some cases it is not used as a verb but an adverb indicating a description of a high degree. For example, å¸\\x85å\\x93\\xad means \"extremely handsome\" or \"so handsome that it makes me cry\". Got that? Now that you\\'ve mastered how to fawn over appearances, it\\'s time to comment on the acting: I am overcome by these acting skills. Zh¨¦ yÇ\\x8enjÃ¬ wÇ\\x92 fÃº! è¿\\x99æ¼\\x94æ\\x8a\\x80æ\\x88\\x91æ\\x9c\\x8dï¼?   I could feel the good acting even on the other side of the screen.

This means, of course, that they are also their idol\\'s staunchest defenders against any negative feedback. To ordinary audiences, the most fanatical admirers of a celebrity are called \"brain-damaged fans (è\\x84\\x91æ®\\x8bç²? nÇ\\x8eoc¨¢n fÄ\\x9bn).\" Their favorite shot to fire is the all-purpose line, \"Do you know how hard-working he/she is?

In these situations, their loyal è\\x84\\x91æ®\\x8bç²?(nÇ\\x8eo c¨¢n fÄ\\x9bn) will try a different tack - everyone makes mistakes. He\\'s still just a kid. Why can\\'t we give him a second chance?

       " ['Longest night, tastiest feast nan Editor\\'s note: To understand China, sit down to eat. Food is the indestructible bond that holds the whole social fabric together and it is also one of the last strong visages of community and culture. The Winter Solstice will soon be upon us on Dec 21 and, to the Chinese, this is both an important solar term as well as a major traditional festival. The longest night in the year also signals that, from there on, the daylight hours will only get lengthier. It signifies an awakening of the earth and the start of the annual rejuvenation, culminating in Spring Festival, about a month away. As far back as 2,500 years ago, during the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC), Chinese astronomers calculated the exact dates of the winter solstices, the first of the solar terms to be so precisely set.   - At Winter Solstice, dumplings are a must in northern China, with more meat used and the fillings speckled with finely-diced dried mushrooms or dried baby shrimp. Zou Hong / China Daily  To the Chinese, it is yet another sign from heaven to gather together and bond as a family, an occasion that takes more and more effort these days as the urban diaspora spreads. In the lunar-solar calendar, this is the last of three important family festivals, after Spring Festival and Mid-Autumn festival. As in every major celebration, food is central. The southern provinces, less influenced by the conquering Mongolian-Manchurian influences up north, still commemorate the winter solstice in the old ways. Here, the belief is that this winter festival is almost as important as the lunar new year. The essential banquet must be prepared, with dishes of chicken, pork, fish and vegetables. Little glutinous rice balls are always eaten, their name wanzi or tangyuan being homophonic with \"reunion\". There are always regional specialties in a festival where ancestor worship is included in the rituals. Whether it be a private celebration at home or a more elaborate gathering at the village clan hall, food offerings reflect the terroir and culinary culture. In the Chaoshan region of Guangdong province, sugar cane plantations dot the countryside and sugar is an important product.    Raw cane sugar is cooked into a thick syrup, which is then spun and pulled into a taffy. The hardening sugar strand is repeatedly worked until it solidifies into slender snowy white tubes that are as light as air. These tangcong, or \"sugar scallions\", are eaten wrapped in a flour crepe and garnished with crushed toasted peanuts. It is a labor-intensive candy that must be offered to the ancestors as a sweet reminder that they are not forgotten. In ancient communities in Fujian and Ningbo, little glutinous rice balls are offered to the gods. Fujian uses sweet potatoes in both the dough and the filling, while the Ningbo version keeps the rice balls plain, but served in a soup flavored by sweet wine lees. Ningbo is famous for its yellow rice wines. Cantonese tangyuan combines the best of both worlds. There are different fillings for the rice balls, including red bean paste, sweetened sesame paste, lotus seed paste and peanut paste. Sometimes, the rice balls are made plain but are colored brightly for an auspicious end to the meal. Also, they are always served in a sweet syrup flavored by ginger to chase away the chills and aid digestion. While winters are less harsh in southern China, the bone-chilling winds of the north demand heartier fare. So in Tengzhou, Shandong province, they celebrate with a steaming pot of mutton soup, a tradition that has prevailed since the Han Dynasty (202 BC-220 AD). According to legend, it was the father of traditional Chinese medicine Zhang Zhongjing who got the people eating mutton. He believed it was just what they needed to warm up the blood after a cold winter, and to this day gifts of mutton are brought to the elders in the family during the winter solstice. In the northern provinces, such as Hebei, Liaoning and even in Beijing, dumplings are eaten, as for almost every other major occasion. Homemade dough is rolled into very thin wrappers for fillings of minced meat and vegetables. Because it is the winter solstice, more meat will be used and the fillings are sometimes speckled with finely diced dried mushrooms or dried baby shrimps. These hearty dumplings are normally just boiled in water, but during the winter solstice, they are served with soup. The soups will be flavored with shredded dried laver sheets and more of the dried baby shrimp or krill, topped by fresh coriander. Whatever food appears on the table, the Winter Solstice is the first sign of cheer after a long gloomy season, and there is a lilt of anticipation in the air, as well as the fragrance of festive dishes. paulined@chinadaily.com.cn Winter Solstice Soup Dumplings Serves 4 80 ready-made dumpling skins 1 beaten egg 500g minced pork 300g shrimp meat 6-8 dried shiitake mushrooms, soaked 2 tablespoons minced water chestnuts 2 tablespoons finely diced carrots I tablespoon cornstarch 1 tablespoon sesame oil 2 tablespoons water Salt and pepper Chicken stock Chinese greens First prepare the filling: Roughly chop the shrimp and add to the minced pork, together with diced carrots and water chestnuts. Remove stems from the soaked mushrooms and dice. Add to mixture. Season with sesame oil, salt and pepper and add cornstarch and water to loosen up the filling. Stir in one direction until the meat mixture binds. Wash the Chinese greens, which can either be Shanghai cabbage, bok choy or green lettuce. Set aside, ready to use. Wrap the dumplings: Place a large spoonful of filling in the center of each dumpling wrapper. Wet the edges with the beaten egg and simply fold over, pressing the edges firmly together and smoothing out any air pockets. Set aside on a lightly floured board until you finish making all the dumplings. Heat up a pot of water and a pot of chicken stock. Cook the dumplings by dropping them 10 at a time into the boiling water. When the dumplings all float to the surface, they are done. Blanch the greens in the chicken stock and place them at the bottom of each soup bowl. Place cooked dumplings on top and ladle hot chicken stock over them. If you like, you can garnish with chopped spring onions, coriander and a drizzle of sesame oil. Reunion Rice Balls 1 small packet glutinous rice flour (225g)    Warm water (blood temperature) Food coloring - red, yellow, green 5 cm piece ginger, lightly crushed Rock sugar Place rice flour into a mixing bowl and add enough warm water so the dough comes together. Be careful to add it a little at a time, sprinkling more water if the dough seems stiff. Divide dough into four portions, coloring each portion with red, yellow and green food colors and leaving one portion white. Roll up small teaspoons of dough into little balls. Make a simple syrup with about liter of water and rock sugar to taste, adding the ginger for flavor. Cook the rice balls in boiling water, stirring so they don\\'t stick to the bottom of the pot. When they float, they are ready and can be served with the ginger syrup. Keep the rice balls small so they cook easily. You can also add fillings of crunchy peanut butter or red bean paste but make sure the dough is sealed properly so the filling does not burst during cooking.

       " [\"Singing has stayed in tune with the times nan First they did it in karaoke bars, then they did it in living rooms and now they're doing it in the bedroom. In the early 1990s, karaoke bars began springing up all over China. Before long, for many people, singing became the after-dinner entertainment of choice. Then, with the help of computer programs that could provide anyone with a karaoke DJ, the venue changed. It became possible to organize karaoke parties at home or simply entertain yourself. At the same time, you can fantasize about being a star. In the next wave of change, in the era of the internet - and lately through apps and social networking - software has become much more sophisticated. Thus, a form of leisure that had been enjoyed in public but had retreated to the private realm, reasserted itself in public, thanks to live streaming and the ability to distribute music and engage with audiences.    A report by Beijing internet consultancy Analysys suggests that the new lease on life for karaoke could at least partly be attributed to the huge popularity of television talent shows. In fact, some of the companies that develop and distribute mobile karaoke apps have formed alliances with TV producers as they seek to cash in on the popularity of the shows. In the first quarter of this year, more than 57 million mobile karaoke apps had been installed on devices in China, Analysys says, with most users born in the 1990s. Many were from provincial capitals; most were students, freelancers or self-employed; and female users outnumbered males. About 62 percent of the users of the app Changba were female, as were about 60 percent of the users of WeSing, according to analysys. The apps provide a good platform for budding internet celebrities to become better known, Analysys says, and once they are well known enough they can take part in the apps' singing contests or reality shows to become even better known.    - Zhang xin, a Changba celebrity singer, performs at a bar.

       " ['Beijing, Paris agree to enhance pursuit of fugitives nan Beijing and Paris will strengthen joint investigations of corrupt officials who have fled China, while improving systems for the return of ill-gotten assets illegally transferred to France, a senior anti-graft official from the Ministry of Justice says. Chinese judicial officers and their French counterparts will expand intelligence-sharing and evidence-collecting in major cases, says Zhang Xiaoming, deputy director-general of the Judicial Assistance and Foreign Affairs Department at the Ministry of Justice. They will set up a work team and work closely on investigating, freezing and confiscating illicit money. They also will establish a quick-response procedure to combat cross-border economic crimes such as telecom fraud, he says. Zhang says that during a recent meeting in Beijing, law enforcement officers from both countries exchanged views on tracking down fugitives and returning their ill-gotten money. \"It\\'s more than necessary to share information with our Chinese counterparts in a timely manner and, after obtaining intelligence, such as indications of money laundering or other economic fraud, access our system to continue the investigation,\" says Robert Gelli, head of the Directorate for Criminal Matters and Pardons of the Ministry of Justice of France.    In recent years, Western countries, including the United States, Canada and some European countries, have become popular destinations for corrupt officials because an absence of bilateral extradition treaties and differences in legal systems make it harder to secure their return, according to the Ministry of Public Security. Since April 2015, when Interpol issued red notices for the capture of 100 major Chinese corrupt officials, 36 have been returned from more than 16 countries and regions - including two from France - to stand trial, according to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. Two of the most-wanted female economic fugitives await extradition from France to face trial, according to the Ministry of Public Security. One of them is Feng Jinfang, a former private company executive; the name of the second has not been disclosed. Both suspects are accused of defrauding investors and have been detained in France. It will be the second time important fugitives from China have been extradited from France since a bilateral extradition treaty took effect in 2015. Zhang acknowledged that, while progress has been made, practical challenges still hinder further judicial cooperation between China and France. Huang Feng, a law professor at Beijing Normal University, says the priority is to \"improve the quality of evidence and offer a complete chain of evidence\" - including proof that assets were raised illegally - to assist France when its assistance is requested.

Zhang Huanzhi, Nie\\'s mother, accompanied by her lawyers, handed over the application at the Hebei Provincial High People\\'s Court. The total amount of compensation applied for is 13.91 million yuan, of which 12 million is for the psychological damage Nie and his parents suffered over the past two decades, according to the lawyers.   - Nie Shubin\\'s family burns the innocent verdict at the grave of Nie Shubin. Chi Tu / For China Daily   - Nie Shusheng, father of Nie Shubin, speaks to the press after the pardon. Provided to China Daily   \"Nie\\'s freedom was seriously infringed upon as he was wrongly detained for 216 days, and he was then executed, which brought great suffering to him and his parents. According to the State Compensation Law, the family should be given mental compensation,\" says Wang Dianxue, a lawyer from Beijing Jingshi Law Firm.    The family also asked for compensation for funeral expenses and fees incurred from their long-term litigation, Wang adds. In addition, judicial bodies found to be guilty of flaws in handling Nie\\'s case are required to send a letter of apology to the parents, and to publish any compensation agreement via the media, which is aimed at recovering Nie\\'s reputation and removing negative effects on his family and society, Wang said. \"The application has been filed by the court,\" he adds. By law, government agencies or officers involved in State compensation should make a decision on compensation within two months of receiving an application. During this period, the departments involved are asked to listen to the applicants and may negotiate the terms and value of compensation, the law states. Zhang Xinnian, another Beijing-based attorney, says the high people\\'s court in Hebei should not only deal with the compensation case in line with the law, but also suggest social welfare organizations provide legal aid for the family. \"After all, money is one element for the parents, but mental support and comfort are also important,\" Zhang says. In addition, it is important to assess the accountability of the judicial officers who were allegedly at fault in dealing with the case, he adds.    On Dec 2, Nie, 21, a native of Hebei, was found innocent at the Second Circuit Court of the Supreme People\\'s Court in Shenyang, capital of Liaoning province, on the basis of unclear facts and insufficient evidence, although he had already been executed for the rape and murder of a woman in 1995. Since then, Nie\\'s parents have appealed to governments and courts to clear their son\\'s name. Nie\\'s case came into the public eye again in 2005, when a man named Wang Shujin, also from Hebei, was detained for a separate rape and murder case. During Wang\\'s detention, he confessed to the crimes that cost Nie his life. Judicial bodies in Hebei then began an investigation, with each development in the case making national headlines. In December 2014, the country\\'s top court asked Shandong Provincial High People\\'s Court to conduct an investigation. In June this year, the highest judicial chamber ordered the circuit court to retry the case. caoyin@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/16/2016 page15)'],\n",
       " ['Chinese math teaching buoys British schools nan British education officials expect the benefits of the Shanghai Mastery model for teaching and learning mathematics to reach about half the primary schools in the United Kingdom as a result of an exchange program currently underway. In the third round of the program, launched more than two years ago, around 30 math teachers from Shanghai did a two-week stint in the UK in which they shared their Chinese-style teaching methods at 35 primary schools. In July, the UK government rolled out the Chinese Mastery approach to math instruction at more than 8,000 institutions, using funding of up to 41 million ($51.6 million; 48.9 million euros) over four years to improve British students\\' performance. Clare Fowler, director of math education policy for England at the UK Department for Education, says teaching methods for math in UK schools have changed a great deal. The exchange program between China and the UK started in September 2014, when 71 British math teachers went to Shanghai to spend time with their exchange partners at high-performing schools and colleges. Between November 2014 and March 2015, about 120 mathematics teachers from China taught at more than 200 schools in the UK, and almost 1,000 British teachers listened to the classes taught by their Shanghai counterparts, according to the Chinese Embassy education section.    \"We are developing a deep understanding of the teaching of mathematics in China and what makes it so effective,\" says Debbie Morgan, director for primary schools at the National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics. \"This deep understanding is important if we are going to adopt the strategies in an attempt to improve mathematics teaching in England.\" In November, an independent study by the University of Oxford said students taught using the traditional Asian \"Mastery\" methods do \"significantly better\". It was the first study of its kind confirming that children perform at levels far ahead of their peers after learning math through Chinese-style teaching methods. The effect may take some time to appear on a broader scale, though. Recent reports have shown few overall signs of improvement. They say this demonstrates the need to introduce the Chinese system at an early age. wangmengjie@mail.chinadailyhk.com (China Daily European Weekly 12/16/2016 page14)'],\n",

The initiative was included in the Guideline on State Informatization for the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20), which was approved at a State Council executive meeting presided over by Premier Li Keqiang on Dec 7. According to a statement released after the meeting, barriers to sharing information will be overcome to establish an integrated, connected and secure system for the nation\\'s data resources by interconnecting information systems between different government departments and accelerating the process of providing public access to data.    Under the four major targets set in the guideline, China will expand its broadband reach in rural areas, while further reducing costs; build a system to monitor information security; and promote 12 priority projects, including 5th-generation telecommunication technologies. Meanwhile, online scammers will be the focus of a severe crackdown and sterner punishment, as the guideline also aims at containing such frauds. Informatization and digitalization have great significance in innovation and to the national Made in China 2025 strategy, and can improve people\\'s livelihoods, the statement said. The guideline showed the country\\'s determination to overcome the barriers and closely connect core data, says Ning Jiajun, a consultant for the Advisory Committee for State Informatization. He adds that this will probably speed up the informatization process. At present, most of the core data is being controlled by key government departments, which has created \"artificial walls and isolated islands\" to obstruct distribution and sharing of data, says Ning.

Then I had to adjust to the status quo of urban affordable housing, which my instructor thought was too general,\" Zhang says. \"But that\\'s the only part of my specialized area could find specific information and data to support my thesis. My friend found all the records needed for his thesis for his master\\'s degree in New York, 90 percent of which was available online or at the library.\" As a country undergoing rapid development in internet technology, China is encouraging the integration of the internet with other industries, such as traditional manufacturing and agriculture. But huge amounts of data, which are being generated to help sellers find market opportunities, are still hidden from most people. Data sharing has also been a major concern for Li Keqiang. At the opening ceremony of the Big Data Summit in May in Guiyang, Guizhou province, Li said the government holds 80 percent of the data and information generated in the nation and will publicize more, except that which is related to national security, commercial secrets and privacy. By doing this, the government can create a market of fair competition while integrating with the internet and big data to boost public services, he said. The State Council, China\\'s Cabinet, has held several executive meetings since November 2015 on integrating the internet with government services, aiming to simplify the process of approving applications by relocating the provision of services away from physical government buildings to online channels. Electronic data and broadband service can be thought of as the infrastructure for online business and services, says Zhou Hanhua, a researcher on governmental information at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. \"Some of us have entered the age of information but some have not, due to lack of a sharing mechanism between different departments,\" Zhou says. \"That should be altered to boost efficiency and make it simple for the public to get their applications done.\" huyongqi@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/16/2016 page14)'],\n",
       " [\"Is this the road to a more stable future? nan In September 2013, President Xi Jinping formally announced the Silk Road Economic Belt in Kazakhstan, and in February 2014 he expanded the program to include maritime trade. The Belt and Road Initiative, an combination of overland and a maritime corridors, will connect eastern China to western Europe and provide a platform that will stimulate economic, trade and cultural interactions. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, launched in Beijing in June 2015, is another important initiative aimed at reinforcing China's role in global affairs. The Belt and Road Initiative and AIIB constitute two ambitious initiatives, both of which play an important role in China's foreign policy strategy for economic, trade and strategic outreach to China's partners.    In our interconnected world, the links between economics, trade and security are extremely important. The economic and trade logic is expected to help overcome obstacles and hesitations linked to security that have stalled similar projects before. Trade and economics increase the level of transactions between countries, enhance familiarity between people and discourage conflict. It is important to note that China's strategy of security and economics creates a dense network of relations that bring assurances of security which will particularly increase influence in Asia and Europe. Economic development may address the roots of conflict in Pakistan, Afghanistan and China's western frontiers. Unlike most other countries, China has substantial foreign reserves for large-scale projects. This enables it to ensure that countries along the corridors share an interest in participating in the ownership of the initiative, since their companies will participate in the building of the infrastructure. Many countries along the Belt and Road lack the resources to set up competing business and trade networks, so they have no choice but to participate in those sectors that might improve their connectivity to major markets and resource supplies. The Belt and Road Initiative has been welcomed by more than 60 countries, and is of particular interest to Pakistan and India. The China-Pakistan corridor is important because the harbor of Gwadar is one of the points where overland and maritime routes intersect. The Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar economic corridor connecting Yunnan in southern China with Myanmar, Bangladesh and eastern India is of importance to India. With regard to other geopolitical concerns it remains to be seen how much the initiative will converge or compete with Russia's Euroasian Economic Union initiative. The EU matters for the Belt and Road Initiative, and the Belt and Road Initiative matters to the EU. The European dimension of the project is an integral element of the initiative. During the June 2015 EU-China Summit, both parties decided to build synergies between the Belt and Road Initiative and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker's investment plan, and to actively explore business and investment opportunities. There are carefully selected nodal points along the land corridor and transit and terminal points along the maritime corridor in Europe. The EU has demonstrated that it is willing to go beyond short-term economic gains to attract China's direct investment and play an important role in turning the Belt and Road Initiative into reality. The European Investment Bank has set up a group comprising the initiative, the European Commission and the European Investment Bank to coordinate and help accelerate the implementation of projects. China is also using Juncker's investment plan to boost involvement in Europe. Greece has been placed on the map as the end point of the maritime corridor. Cosco operates two container terminals and manages 67 percent of the port of Piraeus, which now serves as a major logistics hub for China's trade with Europe. Cosco took over TrainOSE, the Greek railway company that already signed agreements for freight transport to Central and Northern Europe with Hewlett Packard, Sony, Huawei and ZTE. A high-speed rail corridor is envisioned to connect the port of Piraeus with Northern and Central Europe. All these agreements will reinforce Cosco's cooperation with the largely global Greek shipping industry. It should be noted that most ships for the Greek merchant fleet are built in China. Another terminus on the maritime belt is the port of Rotterdam, an important cargo hub for Europe where land and maritime corridors come together. Hungary is also a key logistical hub on the trans-Siberian link, which serves as a distribution point for Chinese exports to Europe. In addition to physical infrastructure, China wishes to rely on Europe for the financial integration needed for effective implementation. The EU's contribution is needed for a sophisticated financial network to underpin the physical infrastructure that will bind Europe and Asia together. As of the end of 2015, more than 1,400 contracts were announced for infrastructure and other projects alongside Belt and Road areas. There are ongoing discussions at bilateral, multilateral and regional levels on how to accelerate the implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative through concrete projects. In 1993 the EU launched the Transport Corridor Europe Caucasus Asia, a project similar to the China's initiative. EU technical assistance has been used to develop a transport corridor on an East-West axis from Europe across the Black Sea, through the Caucasus and the Caspian Sea to Central Asia. Ongoing projects cover transport and network operability, logistics and transport safety and security. In a nutshell, the Belt and Road Initiative, with its continental and maritime dimensions, will enable China to assume its responsibilities on the world stage more fully as a global power. The initiative could have an important impact on China's domestic economy through export of its excess steel, cement and aluminium. In addition to the economic/trade objectives the Belt and Road has a security dimension, especially where energy is concerned. Although it offers opportunities to boost trade and investment in the regions it covers, it also presents challenges due to uncertain political and regulatory conditions. The project passes through conflict-ridden geographical areas and countries with weak administrative structures. For many countries along the Belt and Road Initiative, transparency, accountability and good governance are not priorities. Their poor credibility regarding security, government effectiveness, tax policies and low standards of local infrastructure, may hinder China's plans for effective implementation of the project. The critical challenge is to turn good intentions in agreements reached at the top tier of government, into real cooperation at the local level where implementation usually takes place. China hopes that the economic development along the corridor will also help reduce tensions between the various Muslim minorities and the rest of the Chinese population. There is no doubt that through the Belt and Road, China is defining a broad geopolitical approach for future investment and trade that will affect the selection of future infrastructure projects. China's important involvement in the development of global supply chains may provide the impetus for new regional frameworks and rules. It remains to be seen to what extent the Belt and Road Initiative's regional impact will lead to new rules of global governance now that multilateral efforts at the World Trade Organization and other United Nations multilateral forums have been stalled.

       " [\"China edging more into tech value chain nan A small number of companies have become successful global brands without control of supply and assembly of key components The global value chain of the information and communications technology sector has undergone considerable evolution in recent decades, with China's participation growing in significance. Although the most innovative aspects associated with shaping the trajectory of internet-related activities continue to be dominated by Western technology companies, the center of gravity of most of the manufacturing and assembly work of key products and devices has shifted to Asia, with China playing an increasingly important role in production. China's role, however, continues to be a relatively subordinate one.    Having failed to achieve significant technology transfer from foreign companies in China through insisting on the establishment of joint ventures with Chinese companies, state policy more recently has focused on the promotion of indigenous innovation, while using its rapidly growing market as a leverage for its relationship with foreign investors. The challenge for Chinese policymakers is to find the right balance between China's ongoing dependence on foreign technology and the collaborative role it needs to develop with major technology companies in its deepening involvement in the global value chain. In pushing for technical standards based on indigenous innovation, China faces demands for compliance with international norms both from abroad and from within the country, while attempting to achieve a certain level of autonomy for the development of Chinese firms. In a recently published paper, our analysis illustrates how Western companies, together with companies from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan continue to dominate the upper reaches of the ICT value chain and, despite locating much of their production activity in Chinese mainland, have succeeded in avoiding any major leakage of intellectual property to competitors. Although the technological trajectory of the ICT global value chain continues to be controlled by these companies, the significant shift in ICT production to the Chinese mainland raises questions about the future evolution of the value chain, and whether a tipping point has been reached in relation to China's possible indispensable role in its development.    Among these implications is the extent to which major global technology companies can exploit the comparative advantages of China while continuing to ensure its subordinate role in the global value chain. While some commentators on the relationship between the Chinese state and foreign investors tend to emphasize the obvious tensions that can arise in the bargaining process, our data analysis, including company interviews, suggests a more nuanced and complex relationship. Analysis of trade data relating to the most significant importing and exporting ICT companies in China between 2001 and 2012 provides useful insights into both the evolution of China's role in the value chain, and the role played by mainland companies. In addition to significant growth in the volume of ICT activity during this period, there has been an important shift by foreign companies from using China primarily as a low-cost export platform to an increased focus on China as a rapidly growing market for ICT products and services. China's increased role in the ICT value chain has been closely related to the growth in outsourcing and offshoring of ICT production, assembly and testing by major global technology companies to the Chinese mainland. To some extent, the main beneficiaries of this enormous shift in the center of gravity of ICT production have been Taiwan companies, Foxconn in particular, which by far is the world leader in contract manufacturing on behalf of global technology companies. These original design manufacturing companies, however, operate under a regime of very tight control of their major clients, who also ensure that profit margins are razor thin. Foxconn's rise during this period has been particularly associated with Apple's business model of outsourcing 100 percent of its production to China, while ensuring no leakage of intellectual property through stringently controlling its contract manufacturers and supplier companies. Because of the importance of intellectual property and innovation in controlling the technological trajectory of the ICT sector, the role played by high value added component companies in areas like semiconductors and hard disk drives, and more recently applications processors for mobile devices, is crucial. Our data reveal that, apart from the dominant role of companies in South Korea and Taiwan in the thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display (TFT-LCD) display area, Western companies continue to play an important role as component suppliers, with Samsung being both a significant brand company as well as a major supplier. Apart from Foxconn in the original design manufacturing sector, Samsung, with its rather exceptional in-house production model, is the other company that dominates the trade data across the whole spectrum of activity. The lack of technological progress to date by Chinese mainland companies in generating significant inputs from indigenous innovation is obvious. Some commentators claim that policymakers have begun to appreciate the limits of a growth path driven by policy-induced high-tech exports. Despite a poor performance in achieving any significant control in either ICT assembly or in the supply of key components, a small number of Chinese companies have become highly successful global brands. While questions continue to be raised about the extent of state regulation of China's domestic market, and bearing in mind their reliance to some extent on the capabilities of foreign suppliers, the significant progress made by these Chinese brands should be acknowledged. Our data indicate that, over time, these companies have succeeded in dislodging significant Western companies that were initially highly successful from the lists of top ICT traders in China. The considerable strides made by these companies, which is reflected in their ability to compete globally, is further attested to by our company management interviews. But rather than falling into a simplistic binary model of foreign and mainland companies, both our data and company interviews suggest a more nuanced picture of significant interconnections between many types of companies through client relationships, joint ventures, and mergers and acquisitions. To some extent, the success of Chinese brands is exaggerated by the invisibility of major global brands such as Apple, whose production is masked by original design manufacturing company trade. The success of these Chinese brands, however, raises interesting questions about the ability of indigenous companies in an exceptionally fast-growing market of enormous scale, to displace formerly successful brands in what is, for them, a very different marketplace. With the continuing shifts in the ICT global value chain in an era of mobile devices, cloud computing and expanding ecommerce, the potential for Chinese companies for creating more intense competition for established global corporations is considerable. Whether they can gain greater market penetration globally without the necessary progress in vital areas of intellectual property remains to be seen.

       " [\"Financial creativity crucial for East Africa nan East Africa should continuously cooperate with Developmental Financial Institutes, known as DFIs, to deal with the peak period of debt repayment. Countries in the region are dealing with a growing debt burden and will gradually reach the peak period for repayment, due to the major commitment to infrastructure financed by the DFIs. One solution is for countries to cooperate with DFIs continuously to deal with the repayment issue and convert the burden into an opportunity for growth. Benefiting from infusions of external capital, East African countries have seen unprecedented levels of stable economic growth over the last decade. However, as a consequence, the peak period for debt repayment is also arriving. For example, Kenya's treasury will have to deploy approximately 40 percent of its tax revenues just to service loans next year.    Should we view the side-effects of progress in loans as a sign to cut down engagement with DFIs? The answer is definitely no. In fact, the current debt situation has already benefited from low interest rates and well-designed repayment models provided by DFIs. It's hard to imagine the completion of the expensive Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway without the support of concessional loans from the Export-Import Bank of China. The modern railway has become a perfect model to leverage the low-cost overseas capital to accelerate domestic construction and foster tremendous opportunities for Kenya's national strategy and regional development. Meanwhile, DFI loans are often designed to facilitate repayment with grace periods. Accordingly, Tanzania was firmly rated by the IMF as a state with low risk of external debt distress, despite having a high external debt rate of roughly 70 percent. One fact contributing to this is that roughly all the external debt of Tanzania remains under DFIs, especially multilateral DFIs, such as the International Developments Association and the African Development Bank. For example, DFI financing assists Tanzania considerably in stabilizing its repayment burden and debt distress. With the help of external DFI financing, other often-neglected spillover effects help to foster socioeconomic development. Although there is a seemingly inappropriate budget allocation deficiency for education and health in African countries, the robust economic growth and technology transfer will gradually and effectively compensate for social welfare. This so-called share squeezing is temporary, and could be the beginning of new advantages, as some Asian countries experienced after World War II. Technology transfer, an increasingly vital principle in any project in Africa, will also partially compensate for insufficient investment in education. There is even an argument that the completion of a large-scale project is a graduation ceremony for the local workers involved. However, it is difficult for government leaders to wait for the spillover effects to take effect. That requires time. Currently, Tanzania's leadership is launching unprecedented campaign to enhance the country's competitive capacity in the form of tax reform. The government plans to collect taxes evaded or underpaid going back 20 years. Other than political factors, the tax revenue to be collected is expected to relieve Tanzania's repayment burden and dependence on development aid, especially for those with intervention suspicions. The necessity to correct tax evasion should never be denied, but time is needed to examine the results of this ambitious and dangerous campaign. It's obvious that this controversial operation has already offset the state's potential spillover effects. The business environment has been damaged, since the Tanzania Revenue Authority is being urged to collect a fixed amount in a limited time, which leads to unreasonable fines without transparency. Large numbers of entrepreneurs, who are not only the pillar of support for the state in this difficult period but also the tunnel for spillover effects, have been driven away or even into bankruptcy. Moreover, the government's attitude toward developmental financial engagement should never be packed in the form of nationalism, no matter whether or not the engagement has strings attached. A complete deviation away from external financing will put the country into worse financial condition than ever. The answer to financial difficulties lies in continuous and deeper cooperation with DFIs, rather than completely pulling away. Further cooperation is the pivot of reversing the vicious cycle of the debt burden. Creative use of DFIs, such as introducing Public and Private Partnerships, will not only leverage more smart capital and relieve sovereign guarantees, but also improve the state's financial management skills. Financial creativity brings more learning opportunities to technocrats than simple lending. New skills will, over time, enhance the state's financial condition from both sides.

       " [\"Trump may find tough sledding ahead nan Any country attempting to run a closed-door market parallel to an open global one will suffer by losing its competitiveness Some people have begun comparing Donald Trump with Ronald Reagan. Under the Reagan administration, the US economy underwent remarkable growth, as did the US dollar (against other currencies) and the US stock market. For Trump himself, this is of course what he would like to achieve, if only he can. There are also observers saying Trump's chances are slim on various grounds - such as too few people to hire (for a plan of 25 million new jobs), delayed results (from infrastructure investment), and meager domestic saving. These are all arguments on the technical level. More fundamentally, however, the questions that one has to ask are: What industries will the new policies benefit? And what consumers will those industries serve?    Doubtless, low interest rates and tax cuts will conspire to encourage companies to invest more and produce more. But in a situation many investors are calling asset famine, what industries are worth so much new investment? Or, where can investors find good returns of their investment? The building of infrastructure is an answer that one can easily think of. But no country can fully develop itself by building infrastructure solely. Admittedly, building and renovation of infrastructure can generate a lot of manufacturing jobs. A high-speed rail system needs new rails, engines and new passenger and cargo cars, along with construction of new facilities . But they cannot realize their value unless they eventually win more customers and generate more sales. Hardly any country - and not even the Chinese government, with its not-so-small sector of state-owned enterprises - can realize a profit directly from building infrastructure, which is by definition a public good whose use is open to all. It is only its users who, by lowering cost from their newly gained convenience, can make a good profit. And the most efficient users are usually from the private sector. So infrastructure will have to serve an industrial purpose, to help other industries in their value-added production and services. Maybe, in a more favorable policy environment, some industrial activities, like the making of air-conditioners, can remain in the United States for a few more years. But it is the same kind of manufacturing activities that workers in Mexico can perform. If the United States shuts its door completely to competition at this level, it will take the risk that in a few years other less-protected countries will be able to turn out even better and cheaper air-conditioners for the global market.    The logic of globalization cannot be reversed. Part of it is the global market. Any country attempting to run a closed-door market parallel to an open global market is going to suffer in the end by losing its competitiveness almost entirely. This is a lesson that China has learned with so much pain from its past experience with a planned economy. In an open, competitive market economy environment, what a government can do to stimulate growth - including providing direct and indirect incentives - is actually very limited. Government help is usually most effective with an industry in its nascent state that can be nurtured before releasing it to full-scale competition. This being the case, it tends to work better in a more focused way rather than in all industries. It helps to promote growth in tech-heavy industries, and any industries where the way of doing things is likely to be different from the past, such as modernization of farming. And it does not help as much to generate jobs in traditional industries. Right now, the hottest industry is perhaps that of artificial intelligence and robots, which potentially threatens many jobs rather than helping Trump deliver his promise of 25 million new jobs. It certainly does not help the non-college-graduate blue-collar workers keep getting paychecks. For a while, the Trump factor can indeed suck a lot of capital in the world to the US market. But in a few years, whether or not he can impress the investors as a second Reagan depends not on the sheer number of jobs he can protect but on what new industries he can help build that prove competitive in the world. Judging from the American wage level, those industries are bound to be making different things than mass market air-conditioner units or mobile phones that workers in other countries can also make. What are they? The world has yet to find out. The author is editor-at-large of China Daily. Contact the writer atedzhang@chinadaily.com.cn  (China Daily European Weekly 12/16/2016 page13)\"],\n",
       " ['Virtual reality will never make you a traveler nan The best experiences are totally unexpected - and it is important to enjoy them in real life Waiting for a medical appointment, I idly picked up a magazine - the sort I would normally never look at in a month of Sundays - and read an article extolling virtual reality as a way of visiting exotic places. Sorry, but that doesn\\'t work for me. You have to go somewhere to sense a place, to talk to people, to get a feel for it. I\\'ve been an inveterate traveler for as long as I can remember, and journalism became the ideal vehicle. Even to this day, I end up somewhere and my first thought is, \"Wow, I\\'m being paid to do this?\" That was my first question when I landed as an extremely callow correspondent in 1972 at Singapore\\'s old Paya Lebar International Airport, now replaced by the superefficient Changi International.    As they cracked open the door of the Malaysia-Singapore Airlines Boeing 707, that never-to-be-forgotten smell of tropical Asia hit me. It was like walking into a warm, soggy sponge. (For aviation buffs, that flight from London, which stopped in Rome, Abu Dhabi and then Singapore, was one of the last by the jointly owned airline. Shortly afterward Malaysian Airline Systems and Singapore Airlines were born.) Relaxing with a very cold Tiger beer next to the pool outside my room that night, I listened to the cicadas chirping away and wondered again: \"I\\'m being paid to do this?\" So I guess that\\'s when I got hooked, and it\\'s been a great ride that certainly is not over yet. There have been moments, thrilling and surreal, that stick in my mind. There was, for example, my flight from Saigon, as it was then called, to Vientiane, the sleepy capital of Laos where the word for \"tomorrow\" makes the Spanish word \"manana\" sound like a swearword. We trundled along at just over 3,000 meters in a much-abused DC3 of Royal Air Laos until - at a stopover in Savannakhet in southern Laos - a large, beaming Laotian lady plonked herself down in the seat across the aisle. The cabin attendant came up with her baggage and put it in the seat next to her. It was a large, protesting piglet, stoutly wrapped in a rattan basket affair. You couldn\\'t make this up.    In Vientiane itself, a fellow correspondent and I, at a loose end one evening, decided to head into town for a drink. Lured by a sign that said \"Draught Guinness\", we went through a barrel-shaped door and stumbled into the Purple Porpoise. Behind the bar stood a one-eyed giant of a man, who greeted us in pure cockney: \"Allo gents, Monty Banks is the name, all the way from Bethnal Green. What\\'s your pleasure?\" I could tell he was a cockney straight away by the way he pronounced his birthplace - \"Befnal Green\". Two satisfying pints later, his story came out. He said he\\'d been a radio operator with one of the joint US-UK Deer military teams that were parachuted into the region in the dying days of the war against Japan, and he never left. Now he was operating this bar. As the gloom lifted, my colleague and I realiszed we were the only civilians in the room. The rest were all men in their 50s and 60s, wearing white aviator shirts and almost to a man sporting huge, chunky gold bracelets - Air America pilots. Air America was the CIA-sponsored airline that got up to all sorts of devious tricks. But I\\'ll save what happened to us for another day. So you tell me, can you get that sort of experience with virtual reality? No way. China is my next target: I want to tackle the Great Wall, which I missed out on during my last visit, and also take in the Three Gorges and, if I can, Xi\\'an.

       " ['Smog has a silver lining for scientists nan Understanding what made postwar Great London Smog so deadly could be a welcome step toward new solutions It seems impossible these days to escape the Great London Smog. Not literally, of course. It is now 64 years since the sulferous yellow blight descended on the British capital, blocking the daylight for five days and killing at least 4,000 people before it was carried off by the wind. Thanks to a glossy new must-see TV series, in which London\\'s most notorious pea-souper plays a supporting role, a new generation has now been introduced to an era of fog, austerity and gloom. But more of that later. More important, a team of Chinese, American and British scientists has finally solved the mystery of what turned the 1952 smog into a mass killer. The research, led by Renyi Zhang, a Nanjing-educated atmospheric scientist at Texas A&M University, included data from Beijing and Xi\\'an, two heavily polluted Chinese cities.  It has long been known that the 1952 smog coincided with a period of cold, windless weather that trapped a pall of pollutants, mostly linked to coal burning, above the city. The new findings, published at the end of November in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, relied on recreating the smog in a lab to determine precisely how sulfur dioxide in the air was turned into deadly sulfuric acid. The scientists found that the main difference between China\\'s pollution and the London smog is that in China much smaller airborne particles are involved. \"In China, sulfur dioxide is mainly emitted by power plants. Nitrogen dioxide is from power plants and automobiles, and ammonia comes from fertilizer use and automobiles,\" Zhang says in a statement. \"Interestingly, while the London fog was highly acidic, contemporary Chinese haze is basically neutral.\" He says the new understanding of air chemistry will foster effective regulatory action in China. \"We think we have helped solve the 1952 London fog mystery, and have also given China some ideas on how to improve its air quality,\" Zhang writes. Which brings us to The Crown. It is the latest multipart megaseries from Netflix, tempting viewers with a sometimes rosy vision of the early reign of Queen Elizabeth. Episode 4 has every Londoner, from the newly enthroned monarch to an increasingly senile prime minister Winston Churchill, wrestling with the smog crisis.  Churchill had boosted the production of coal. In those postwar years it was virtually the only means of domestic heating for most of the city. In the series, his failure to tackle the long-term pollution problem is shown as threatening his government. Personally, I remember the Great Smog rather fondly. For us kids, unaware that as many as 100,000 people were coughing their way to emergency care, or that as many as 12,000 might eventually die from the effects of the pollution, it was something of an adventure. In those days before health-and-safety consciousness, we were allowed out to see how far we could stretch our fingers before they disappeared into the gloom. Bonfires blazed outside bus stations to guide what were then virtually the only vehicles on the streets. In a sense, the Great Smog marked the end of the wartime era, which had carried on since 1945. Rationing was to last for another two years. Money was still in short supply, as were things to spend it on. Inner London was still scarred with bomb sites. But a corner had been turned. The Great Smog at last prompted some action on urban pollution. By 1956, the first Clean Air Act came into force, and the use of raw coal was eventually banned. Pea-soupers, once an essential prop in literary portrayals of London from Dickens to Conan Doyle, became a distant memory. By chance, I recently met a man who was a producer of The Crown and responsible for its smog sequences. He asked me, as a survivor, how I thought he had done. I told him: \"You could have made it thicker.\" The writer is a senior editorial consultant for China Daily UK. ( China Daily European Weekly 12/16/2016 page11)'],\n",

The two sides agreed to implement cooperative projects on fisheries and on oil and gas exploration in Beibu Bay, and to continue conducting joint patrols by the two navies and coast guards, in order to maintain peace and stability at sea. They also reaffirmed that they will continue to implement the consensus reached by the two countries and steadily push forward border and maritime boundary negotiations. Documentary begins the second season The second season of the documentary series The Tokyo Trials premiered on International Channel Shanghai on Dec 13. To mark 70 years since the commencement of the post-World War II tribunal against 28 military and political leaders of Japan, the Shanghai Media Group News Center produced the documentary with the Tokyo Trial Research Center at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The second season\\'s three episodes were made because of stronger research and new discoveries, according to Song Jiongming, head of the SMG News Center. Hepatitis C therapy to be improved Several DAA medicines are expected to get approval from the top drug authority and enter the Chinese market early next year, which will bring China\\'s hepatitis C treatment in line with international mainstream practices, according to Wei Lai, president of the Chinese Society of Liver Diseases of the Chinese Medical Association. Currently, most Chinese patients are on injection interferon therapy, which takes longer and may cause serious reactions for some recipients. DAA, by contrast, is taken orally and can usually get rid of the virus and cure the disease in about 12 weeks. Misuse of funds for fighting pollution found In ongoing central inspections in seven provincial-level regions, more than 1,100 officials have been summoned to talk about their performance in environmental protection, with 687 being held accountable, according to a statement released by the Ministry of Environmental Protection on Dec 13. The inspection teams, headed by ministerial-level officials, have exposed and transferred 5,462 cases to the governments they inspected, and 112 people were detained, the statement says. Total fines from polluters have grown to 66 million yuan ($10 million; 9.41 million euros; 7.89 million), of which Guangdong province has been fined the most out of the regions, which also include Beijing, Shanghai and Chongqing municipalities, and the provinces of Hubei, Shaanxi and Gansu. Ethnic regions see economic growth Economic growth in regions inhabited by ethnic groups in China has been faster than the rest of the country in the past few years, but poverty alleviation remains a long-term challenge, according to a report released on Dec 13. The gross domestic product growth rate of the country\\'s five ethnic autonomous regions - Xinjiang Uygur, Tibet, Ningxia Hui, Inner Mongolia and Guangxi Zhuang - and of the three provinces inhabited by many ethnic groups - Yunnan, Guizhou and Qinghai - was above the national average in 2015, which was 6.9 percent. However, the GDP per capita in these areas is still quite low. Telecom satellite system to encircle the globe China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp plans to build a global real-time communications satellite network by 2020, a senior company executive says. Sun Weigang, chief engineer at the state-owned space giant, says the Hongyan satellite system will be composed of 60 small satellites operating in low orbits and 20 ground stations around the world. The system will provide a wide range of civilian services such as ground data collection and exchange, ship identification and tracking, mobile broadcasting as well as navigation signal enhancement, he says. Military cooperation seen as mutual trust-builder Cooperation between Chinese and the Philippines in the defense and security field, if realized, would further develop the relationship as well as boost mutual trust, Chinese observers say. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said on Dec 11 that he had decided to accept an arms deal offered by China. Duterte said he has directed Philippine Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana to send a general to formally receive guns from Beijing that were offered through what Duterte described as \"a grant payable in 25 years\", according to the Philippine news site Inquirer.net. Xi says law, virtue both crucial to governing Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, underscored governance of the country by both law and virtue, in order to modernize state systems and capabilities. Xi made the remarks at a group study attended by members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee. The group study, the 37th of its kind, focused on governance by law and virtue through Chinese history. Xi said that \"law is virtue put down in words, and virtue is law borne in people\\'s hearts\", adding that law and virtue are both important in state governance, since both regulate social behavior, adjust social relations and maintain social order. Orbiter to study lightning, pollutants China has launched a new-generation weather satellite on Dec 11 that can improve weather forecasting, as well as help study lightning and air pollutants, including PM2.5. The 5.4-metric-ton Fengyun 4A, developed by the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology, was launched on Dec 10 atop a Long March 3B carrier rocket from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Sichuan province, according to the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, which is overseeing the satellite project. The country\\'s latest geosynchronous meteorological satellite will gradually replace the Fengyun 2 satellites, the administration said in a statement. Incident with Japan triggers concern China is gravely concerned about Japan\\'s interference with Chinese Air Force planes passing through Miyako Strait, China\\'s Defense Ministry said. It was the second major confrontation between the two countries\\' air forces this year. The first came in mid-June, when Japanese fighter jets used fire-control radar to target Chinese military planes in the East China Sea, the ministry said in a statement in July. On Dec 17, two Japanese F-15 fighter jets closely harassed and released decoy flares at Chinese Air Force planes that were passing through the Miyako Strait to conduct an exercise in the western Pacific Ocean, Defense Ministry spokesman Yang Yujun said in a news release on Dec 17. Scientists find method to block fearful memories Chinese scientists say they\\'ve found a new way to effectively inhibit a person\\'s fear memory arising from traumatic events such as domestic violence, sexual assault and war. Animal testing led by Yu Yongchun, a researcher at Fudan University\\'s Institutes of Brain Science in Shanghai, found that fear can be effectively removed by transplanting a special kind of nerve cell into the brain of an adult mouse. The findings are expected to shine new light on the treatment of severe mental conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. The results were published online recently by Neuron, an influential journal in the field of neuroscience. Helicopters used to monitor traffic Helicopters have been enlisted in Lanzhou, Gansu province, to monitor rush-hour traffic three days a week. Police are hoping the helicopters will help them spot traffic violations and gather evidence. Police choppers will be on duty every Monday morning, Wednesday afternoon and Friday evening for two hours. They are equipped with high-definition cameras and real-time image transfer systems to send images captured from 150 meters away to traffic police headquarters. River chiefs to balance growth, environment The central government will establish a system of chiefs responsible for rivers and lakes nationwide, and covering all waterways by the end of 2018. The chiefs will take full responsibility for the management and protection of the country\\'s water bodies. Heads of provincial-level regions will be general chiefs responsible for all rivers and lakes in the region, while other top officials at the provincial, city, county and township levels will act as chiefs responsible for different parts of the water bodies, according to a document released by the general offices of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council. Finance sought for radio telescope in Antarctica     Chinese astronomers are applying for government funding to begin construction of a radio telescope in Antarctica that could help solve the mysteries behind stars and galaxies. The proposed facility, to be built on a giant ice cap known as Dome A, has been designed to observe in terahertz, a band of electromagnetic waves normally too weak for ground-based stations to receive. Temperatures at Dome A can fall as low as -80 C. The extreme environment is perfect for scientific experiments, but few were able to make use of it before the Polar Research Institute of China and its international partners set up the Plateau Observatory, or Plato, in 2008. Leaders asked to oversee legal work The central government on Dec 14 issued a new regulation to make the Communist Party of China and government leaders above county level responsible for pushing forward the country\\'s legal framework. It stipulated that such leaders should create agendas for adding legal systems into their regional social and economic growth plans, which should be evaluated annually. They should support the work of legal organs and are forbidden to interfere with any case, the regulation says. Committee elected to choose next HK chief All of the members of the election committee that will choose the next chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region were elected on Dec 11 and 12. Around 1,200 newly elected members in 38 subsectors will vote for Hong Kong\\'s next chief executive in March. The seats in 13 of the 38 subsectors were not contested, since the number of valid candidates in those subsectors did not exceed the number of allocated committee seats, the Electoral Affairs Commission said. In the other 25 subsectors, 1,239 candidates ran for 733 seats. New rules boost robot production China will publish standards to regulate its burgeoning robot industry while pushing for wider robotic applications in key industries, according to officials and experts. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology will work out standards for the industry that will cover such aspects as product quality, research and development capabilities, staff qualifications, sales practices and social responsibility, according to Sun Feng, deputy director of the ministry\\'s Equipment Industry Department, at the 2016 China Robot Industry Conference on Dec 14. The move is intended to raise the core competitive strength of China\\'s industrial robot manufacturing, he said. Shanghai eases access for foreign talent Shanghai recently unveiled measures aimed at attracting talented people from overseas, including high-level professionals and young graduates, as it tries to build itself into a global technological innovation hub by 2030. According to the 10-article immigration policy, recently approved by the Ministry of Public Security, senior overseas professionals will have easier access and spend less time when they apply for permanent resident permits. Expats working at the Shanghai Zhangjiang National Innovation Demonstration Zone or the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone, along with their spouses and children, can directly apply for permanent residency with a recommendation from the administrative committees of the zones.   - Overview of the Bairencheng archaeological site.

       " ['Song apps provide a new stage for fame nan It\\'s the dead of night and Yang Jie is staring at her mobile phone and feeling sentimental. She puts on her headphones, swipes the screen and starts to record herself singing along with the music coming from it. \"I love singing because it helps me relax, especially when I\\'m feeling down,\" says Yang, 28, an office worker from Beijing. She particularly likes singing pop songs by stars such as Karen Joy Morris and Rene Liu and posting her versions online. \"When someone clicks a \\'like\\' button to my song on the app, I feel a sense of achievement and post more songs,\" she says. Millions of Chinese have taken to using such apps in recent years as a way of entertaining themselves and earning kudos from friends and strangers. In their quest for praise and inner satisfaction they can send their performances to those they know, or share them on their social media.     - Participants in the WeSing contest can stream their voices live. Photos Provided to China Daily   Users can broadcast through live streaming or can videotape themselves and upload the clip later. If they lack the skills to sing a song in their own style they can closely follow the style of a recorded original. And if what they produce leaves something to be desired, they can even modify the way their voice sounds. They can also compete with others to be in the app\\'s ranking list to draw more fans. Some well-known singers use apps so their fans can interact with them. \"It\\'s human nature to sing,\" says Chen Hua, founder and chief executive of Beijing Changba Technology Co. \"There has always been a demand for people who can sing, and there always will be. Nothing has changed except the stage on which they perform.\" Changba says its karaoke app has about 30 million active users a month on average, about 62 percent of them female. Most users are between 20 and 25.    Chen says users are always wanting changes and new features, which means the company is constantly having to upgrade the app. \"The social aspects are important in our app. Users can interact with those who have things in common with them,\" Chen says. Ji Mingzhong, product director of the digital music department of Tencent Music Entertainment (Shenzhen) Co, says: \"A mobile app allows you to distribute your beautiful singing online.\" The company is owned by Chinese internet giant Tencent Inc. Tencent\\'s WeSing offers users a strong social network, thanks to the support of its popular instant messaging apps WeChat and QQ. \"The connectivity function plays an important role in keeping app users active,\" Ji says. \"You can interact with friends, for example by listening to their singing and you can sing in chorus with them. You can also challenge your friends.\" Prospects for the market are good and getting better, he says. \"It\\'s essential to integrate singing with other fields, such as short videos and live broadcasting, or expand the settings within which the performances take place and to seek out good-quality content.\" Many of those who use the app will have been influenced by acquaintances who use it, he says. As long as you have talent you can build up a fan base through the app and even become well known, without having to take part in a singing contest on TV, he says. \"As a singing platform, the app helps independent musicians get their work known and it improves their incomes so they can make ends meet.\" Some live stream, singing or chatting with fans. Income depends on how many virtual gifts they receive from fans. For Liu Xingtong, 36, a mobile karaoke app is a good substitute for a karaoke bar.    \"The thing about the app is that I can sing with it whenever I want,\" says Liu, an office worker from Guangzhou. \"Now, rather than going out with friends, all I want to do is sing with all my heart. It\\'s a bit of a difficult situation because I know that if I were in a karaoke bar with them, some would be singing out of tune.\" She used to frequent karaoke bars when she was a teenager. \"It was the golden age of karaoke. Without the internet, reality shows or social media, karaoke was almost the only way for young people to have fun.\" Liu says she used to pay to record her singing in a karaoke bar, but now she can do so free with the app. She also likes to hear others. However, for some, like Yang, a mobile app cannot replace the experience of singing in a karaoke bar. She likes spending time with her friends in a bar because of the relaxed atmosphere and good equipment, such as stereo sound. They often choose a place that serves food, and everyone has a good time, she says. \"It\\'s different having someone right by your side enjoying your singing, rather than receiving a \\'like\\' online. The other thing is that when I\\'m at home using the app it bothers me that my parents may interrupt. In a karaoke room there are no such worries.\" In June 2014 Changba joined with Beijing Mysong Culture Communication Co to establish Changba Mysong KTV, with a chain of more than 70 karaoke bars in 15 provinces and cities. One has 15 to 30 rooms, the idea being to maximize use and minimize overhead.    \"It\\'s karaoke combined with internet thinking,\" Chen says. \"We\\'re striving to provide a great experience for customers. The bright lights, good stereo and a small catwalk in the room make them feel like superstars.\" Guests can do many things with the Changba app, including making a reservation, requesting a song to be played and paying the bill. They can also broadcast their singing live on the app. Chen says the number of people frequenting karaoke bars is falling, but the demand for spending time with friends in such places is still robust. Apart from the popularity of mobile karaoke apps, there are other factors behind the decreasing popularity of the bars, Ji says. Among them are the many ways entertainment can now be delivered, the economic slowdown and the fact that consumers are becoming increasingly picky. \"Going to a karaoke bar is an important social activity for Chinese. Demand is weaker now, but it won\\'t disappear altogether. The best karaoke bars are not affected much and still attract regular customers, but it\\'s different for the bars that are just run of the mill,\" Ji says. Many Chinese households in the past featured lots of singing using various pieces of equipment. Ji reckons those days may be about to return. It is now possible to install a karaoke app on an android TV box. Once you have done so, the whole family can instantly be in the music business. xulin@chinadaily.com.cn   - Changba\\'s celebrity users get together for a singing party.

       " ['Give China its due; stop the protectionism nan China welcomed the 15th anniversary of its entry into the World Trade Organization on Dec 11. In accordance with Article 15 of the accession protocol signed in 2001, the surrogate country approach for calculating so-called dumping tariffs expired on Dec 11, 2016. China should have received market economy status to better protect its companies and workers from the harm of anti-dumping regulations in other markets, such as the United States and the European Union.    But those major economies, joined by Japan, have failed to abide by the rules. This will not only have a negative impact on global trade but will also worsen the global financial situation and the anti-globalization trends in some parts of the world. After joining the WTO, China has been improving its market system and level of marketization. It has also contributed a lot to the sustainable growth of the global economy. At present, it is working on further perfecting its market economy system and to shoulder more responsibility for global economic development. So it is unwise and unreasonable for the above-mentioned economies to continue to employ the tool of the surrogate approach for setting tariffs, which is based on conditions in third countries. One one hand, China has always actively participated and integrated with the world trade system, and has consistently improved its market system and marketization level during exchanges with other economies. Through many global and regional cooperation mechanisms, such as APEC, G20 and AIIB, China has advocated win-win and inclusive development concepts, and it is shouldering more responsibility in the world.    On the other hand, China has always worked on building a market economy system to higher standards to provide a more diversified development path for world economic development. Through new economic concepts such as the Belt and Road Initiative, China has been working to push globalization. It is important to clarify that there is no perfect market system in any country or region. The so-called \"full market economy country\" is also a concept with blurry standards. But whether in state-owned companies\\' reform or in building and improving multilayered capital market, China has always been open and responsive to its imperfections and keeps making progress - which I think is the essence of a market economy. Undoubtedly, as an important player in the global market economy, China has proved that it is worthy of market economy status. And it has been patient, as it has waited for what was written in Article 15 to be carried out properly. It concerns not only China\\'s development, but also the world\\'s prosperity. For other members of the WTO, respecting Article 15 and giving up the surrogate approach is not only their legal duty but also a reasonable judgment and a smart choice. For the European Union, which is now facing crises such as Brexit and other problems, it would be unwise of them to adopt protectionism.

       " ['Breaking with globalization is ill-advised nan Many countries advocating protectionism will suffer the consequences of inertia in economic and social growth structures China\\'s growth in recent decades is an economic miracle. As it lifted 728 million people above the UN-defined poverty line - contrasting with a mere 152 million in the rest of the world since 1981 - China became the world\\'s second-largest economy, contributing nearly 39 percent to global economic growth. China\\'s economic structure has evolved adaptively, from a central-government-ruled economy to a market-oriented one. Since 2001, when China entered the World Trade Organization, the world has benefited enormously from the country\\'s contribution. In return, China also significantly benefited from collaborating with WTO members in terms of improving manufacturing efficiency, technology and innovation capability, and in boosting economic power and catching up with the others. The WTO\\'s basic rule involves mutual trust, non-discriminatory \"national treatment\" and the concept of globalization, which allows members to freely trade with each other according to need. But the 2008 economic crisis created long-lasting pain for both developed and developing countries. Taking the most important indexes to evaluate an economy - GDP growth rate and unemployment - many advanced countries have shown weak capability to recover. The weakness is mainly seen in their social-economic structures\\' ability to sustain growth and well-being. In the post-crisis era, calculating the extent to which China can directly contribute to other countries\\' economic growth has become the keynote. China is no longer an economic spillover taker but an economic spillover giver.    With China\\'s strong willpower and efforts to sustainably transform its economy from one based on manufacturing and investment to a service- and consumption-orientated model, worries have been growing, especially from those who depend economically on the country\\'s economic growth. Therapies to get over economic fatigue are presented with two options: either follow the globalization concept and obey WTO rules for open collaboration in the long run, or to close the door and advocate de-globalization to protect domestic uncompetitive industries. The options are not parallel. It is known that de-globalization in a long run will hurt economic sustainability, political stability, and social advances. The purpose of the WTO is to encourage international trade and facilitate technology and social advances in order to boost each member\\'s comparative advantage. Advanced economies such as the United States, the European Union and Japan bypassed the efficiency-based economic development phrase and are now in the innovation-based stage. The focus for them should be to increase collective social welfare by moving their economies to a more equality-defined sharing economy. Denying other countries - such as China - market economy status and jumping to apply punitive tariffs will not work. Other countries\\' deliberate misinterpretation of China\\'s economic structure, identity and development model, arises from their own internal economic-political unrest. This is not only a stance against China but against globalization. China\\'s important role in the world economy will have to continue, even with some unwise noises emanating from a number of countries\\' mindset of self-interest and de-globalization. In the past decade, it has encountered numerous anti-dumping investigations from a few WTO members. Ironically, none of them would have succeeded without China\\'s contribution. By far, China has obviously raised enough manufacturing and technology capacity for taking care of world consumption - and at high-quality and with a favorable cost ratio. And it has more than sufficient domestic consumption capacity as it braces for a de-globalization phenomena. Many of those countries advocating de-globalization are suffering the consequences of their own inertia and unadaptive economic and social growth structures. The world, especially in the post-economic crisis era, must be a global economy that requires all local economies to collaborate for mutual prosperity and collectively transform to a sustainable entity. In the circumstance where a country finds it difficult to recover from the crisis, China has been acting as a responsible partner. Denying China\\'s market economy status and its role in global landscape under a de-globalization mindset is not wise and will bring our world to an even worse situation.

Their comments came on Dec 12, after China notified the secretariat of the World Trade Organization that it had requested dispute consultations with the US and the EU regarding the special calculation methodology they use in anti-dumping proceedings. Those countries already impose high tariffs on Chinese steel products, leading to a sharp fall in exports of China\\'s seamless steel pipes and tubes.   - Employees work at the factory of Anteel in Liaoning province. Ansteel Group has taken measures to avoid financial losses in exports to the European Union and the United States. Huang Xiandong / For China Daily  The European Commission, the EU\\'s executive body, conducted 15 trade remedy investigations against Chinese goods between 2014 and February this year, and eight of them involved steel products. \"We are paying close attention and are worried about the tendency of the EU and US toward steel protectionism,\" says Yao Lin, vice-president of Ansteel Group in Liaoning province. Eager to restore its earning ability, Ansteel has taken measures to avoid financial losses in exports to those markets. It opened a new plant in April to make high-end steel products for automotive and home appliance manufacturing to offset the weak demand for low-end steel. The facility, constructed in the southern metropolis of Guangzhou, is part of a joint venture with Guangzhou Automobile Group and German multinational ThyssenKrupp. The first phase cost 1.5 billion yuan ($217 million; 205 million euros; 171 million) and has an annual production capacity of 450,000 tons of steel plate. \"The EU has frequently resorted to restrictive measures since the start of 2016, as it blames Chinese steel products for its glutted industry,\" Yao says. \"It is groundless, as Europe\\'s steel woes stem from a weak economy. The EU should be rational and take an objective view, instead of adopting protectionist policies that impede competition. \"The Pearl River Delta is an important base for auto and home appliance manufacturing. Building a presence there allows us to bring our steel products to many of China\\'s most important buyers.\"    Shen Danyang, spokesman for China\\'s Ministry of Commerce, says: \"As many domestic steel-makers are expanding their export channels in other emerging markets - especially those along the Belt and Road Initiative - it is also practical for them to focus more closely on new fast-growing regions, as well as localization strategies for domestic production bases.\" The infrastructure, trade and service network proposed by the Chinese government in 2013 envisions a Silk Road Economic Belt and a 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, covering about 4.4 billion people in more than 60 countries and regions in Europe, Asia and Africa. Shen says Chinese iron and steel smelters should cut risks by further diversifying their export destinations to places such as Africa, the Middle East, South America and member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Bai Ming, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, the think tank of the Ministry of Commerce, says: \"A trade war would certainly harm all of us because it would change the method for determining a fair price. The recovery of the global economy is proving to be more complex than anticipated.\" Liu Zhenjiang, secretary-general of the China Iron and Steel Industry Association, notes that many countries in Europe are having elections soon, and because companies in their steel and solar energy sectors have reported losses in recent years, politicians are trying to use excuses such as overcapacity to subsidize certain industries to affect China\\'s lawful rights and foreign trade activities. \"If China takes retaliatory measures by imposing higher taxes on imports from the US and the EU, their manufacturers will also suffer more financial losses,\" Liu says. \"China is a large steel exporter and a big importer of special steel used in shipbuilding, weapons, automobiles and machine manufacturing. Yet import prices are three times the export price on average,\" says Xue Rongjiu, vice-director of the Beijing-based China Society for WTO Studies. Xue says the country needs to improve the quality of its steel products and move up the value chain. zhongnan@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/16/2016 page7)'],\n",
       " ['As protectionism rises, China may face new problems nan Fifteen years after its accession to the World Trade Organization, China\\'s inward foreign direct investment stock has multiplied by six times, with a compound annual growth rate of 14 percent. More dramatically, its outward FDI stock increased 27 percent per year in the same period, indicating its emergence as the second-largest source of FDI after the US. The rapid growth of China\\'s inward and outward FDI clearly contrasts with the global trend in FDI, which has experienced a significant downturn, especially since the economic crisis occurred in 2008. China\\'s success in both inward and outward FDI is strongly related to its achievements in economic transformation in general and to its efforts in deregulating FDI to meet WTO compliance in particular. Over past two decades, China\\'s FDI policies have seen continuous deregulation with regard to the ownership control, geographical location and sectoral restrictions. The accession to the WTO has led to a reduction in tariffs, elimination of quotas on exports and a reduction in barriers to the cross-border supply of services, while the transformation of the Chinese economic system has changed the competitive landscape in China and thus increased the competitiveness of Chinese firms in the world market. Access to the service sector was a focal point for the US and EU in negotiating WTO accession for China, as this has been of paramount importance to US and European companies in their dealings with China.    Recent developments show a convergence of both Chinese and Western interests in promoting FDI in the service sectors. Over the past decade, China\\'s inward FDI has declined in the manufacturing industry - especially in export processing activities - because of rising labor costs. Yet, this decline has been largely compensated by increasing FDI flows in the service industry, especially in retailing, banking and the insurance sector. Given the fact that China is rapidly turning into a service economy, foreign service multinationals are expected to further invest in projects focusing on consumer services. Another substantial change is the increasing potential for foreign multinationals to participate in China\\'s emerging sectors, which are driven by innovation and technology, such as e-commerce, medical devices and high-end manufacturing. By contrast, traditional sectors with intensive labor inputs and overcapacity, such as the steel, shipbuilding, real estate and industrial products sectors, will be restricted. With regard to the impact of WTO accession on China\\'s outward FDI, the surge of the country\\'s foreign exchange reserves and the mounting pressure of competition in the domestic market convinced the government and Chinese companies of the necessity to build up global competitive advantages in order to sustain economic growth. Actually, the \"go abroad\" strategy was initiated to anticipate and be able to cope with growing competition in domestic markets as a result of China\\'s accession to the WTO in 2001. Facing increasing competition in the domestic market and rising labor costs, it became essential for Chinese firms to move up on the value chain by upgrading their products and manufacturing technologies, and by developing their own brands. These firms, especially the large private industrial ones, backed by their large-scale production and huge sales volume in China, turned to Western countries in their search for technology, brands and markets. As part of their cost leadership strategy, these firms attempt to acquire core technology and assets (such as in the case of Kraussmaffei Group and Gimatic), to occupy key positions in the global value chain, to create (think acquisition of Syngenta by Chinachem) and to tap into global production, transportation and financial hubs (for example, COSCO in Antwerp). The WTO accession has substantially affected the Chinese inward and outward FDI landscape, while the active participation of China in global trade and investment governance has significantly contributed to its effective coordination and monitoring of both inward and outward FDI. Yet, facing increasing economic protectionism and nationalism, new challenges could be emerging for China, especially at its turning point of becoming a service-oriented and knowledge-based economy.

Usually they are the ones demanding that others obey international rules. \"China urges each party to keep their word, observe international law and fulfill their international obligations,\" said Minister of Commerce Gao Hucheng on the 15th anniversary of China\\'s entering the WTO. \"As for those who refuse to keep their promises, China will adamantly protect its legitimate interests and reserve the right to take further measures.\"    On Dec 12, the day after China\\'s WTO transitional period ended, Beijing notified the WTO Secretariat that it had requested dispute consultations with the United States and the European Union over their refusal to act on promises in the WTO accession documents. Article 15 of China\\'s WTO entry protocol allowed other members of the WTO to employ the so-called \"surrogate country\" mechanism to calculate anti-dumping penalties against Chinese products. It clearly states that the provision expires 15 years after China\\'s accession, which would be Dec 11 this year. Starting on Dec 12, China\\'s domestic prices - not those of a third country - should be used as references when WTO members calculate dumping margins, if such cases emerge. Gao said that since this obligation was written into the international treaty, each WTO member should fulfill it by abolishing the \"surrogate country\" system as scheduled. Xue Rongjiu, deputy director of the Beijing-based China Society for WTO Studies, warns that a continuation of the surrogate country system in anti-dumping investigations by the EU and US against China will damage the interests of all three parties in the long run and cost a huge amount in legal resources. Xue\\'s comments came after China notified the Secretariat on Dec 12 that it had requested the dispute consultations. Under the rule, if consultations fail to resolve the dispute, China can request adjudication by a panel. At that stage, experts say, China has a strong case. The defendant party has the right to challenge the panel\\'s ruling within a year. Under these circumstances, a final adjudication would be made by a WTO committee within 90 days. The WTO allows 15 months for the defendant to carry out the final order. If the defendant fails to do so, the aggrieved party can apply trade retaliation measures. It took three decades for China to integrate into the global multilateral trade system. It took 15 years from 1986 for China to resume its status as a party of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, known as GATT, which was converted into the World Trade Organization in 1995. After inking the deal in Doha, Qatar, in 2001, China has worked to turn promises in the lengthy accession documents into action. That involved radical domestic reforms during the 2001-16 transitional period. The figures show that China\\'s efforts have paid off as a win-win with the world economy. Yi Xiaozhun, deputy director-general of the WTO, says China\\'s historic accession has made both China and the WTO stronger and more vibrant, while China has made \"deep and broad commitments\" to reach this point. Yi says China accelerated major steps to liberalize trade before its entry into the WTO - for example, its reduction of most-favored-nation tariffs from 45 percent in 1992 to 15 percent in 2001. In 2015, the average of such tariffs was reduced to 9.5 percent. And China\\'s trade-weighted average tariff is now as low as 4.5 percent. China also has opened up more than 100 service subsectors, such as finance, insurance, legal services, telecom, distribution and courier logistics. He also says China overhauled some 3,000 laws and regulations at the central government level, and many more at the local level, to bring its legal system into compliance with WTO standards. Yi says in the past 15 years both China and the world have seen trade flows rise dramatically. \"In the absence of the surge of imports into China over the last six or seven years, it\\'s very likely the global recession would have further deepened and that Asian countries would have been more adversely affected,\" he says. Furthermore, China is one of the few major developing countries that are committed to granting duty-free treatment for up to 97 percent of products made by the least-developed countries. However, China has yet to agree to terms with many of the developed economies on how to calculate the so-called dumping prices after Dec 11.    Many WTO members fulfilled their promises just a few years after China\\'s WTO entry. Examples include New Zealand, Australia, Iceland and Switzerland, which have not only recognized China as a market economy but also signed agreements for free trade. Up to 100 countries have already phased out the \"surrogate country\" mechanism, which usually puts Chinese exporters in a disadvantageous position in calculating dumping margins. Within the EU, the UK, Netherlands, Hungary and the Nordic countries support China\\'s market economy status. Germany is supportive in principle but is interested in safeguards for sensitive industries. Italy and France are opposed. Since late 2015, US think tanks have exerted influence on the EU, warning of huge job losses if its members grant China market economy status. The EU has also linked the WTO issue to steel overcapacity, which is a global problem. In March, about 5,000 steelworkers marched on the streets outside some EU institutions in Brussels; and the European Parliament voted to refuse China market economy status, with many members saying that it had not met the five criteria set by the European institutions. The vote is not binding. All these efforts go hand-in-hand with the EU\\'s so-called legislative reform steps, which allow it to scrap the list of market economies and use the concept of \"market distortions\" in calculating anti-dumping tariffs. Some European politicians share China\\'s worries about the rise of protectionism in the West. \"Regretfully, the European Union and United States have not fully recognized the potential China would release, and instead have resorted to protectionism,\" said former French premier Jean-Pierre Raffarin during an interview in Paris. \"Protectionism is rampant and we must fight against it.\" Facing the EU and US failure to recognize China\\'s status, Gao, the commerce minister, said the country will join hands with most of the member states to protect the solemnity of the multilateral trading system. Switzerland, among the earliest countries to recognize China\\'s market economy status, has taken a similar position. On Dec 12, in a meeting with visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Johann N. Schneider-Ammann, president of the Swiss Confederation and head of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, Didier Burkhalter, agreed that the Swiss side is willing to deepen cooperation with China to maintain the global free trade system. Wang said: \"With the trends of protectionism picking up, we will take advantage of the chance to upgrade our free trade partnership to send active signals of maintaining the global trade system, while opposing any form of protectionism.\"   - Containers piled up at a port in Qingdao, Shandong province.

       " ['Expanding on a fast track nan As production abroad gains steam, rail company reaches for big share of markets China Railway Rolling Stock Corp, the country\\'s railway vehicle and equipment exporter, says it will augment overseas production and R&D to boost its overseas sales revenue. In 2015, CRRC\\'s overseas sales reached 26.57 billion yuan ($3.86 billion; 3.63 billion euros; 3.03 billion), up 67 percent year-on-year, and accounted for 7 percent of total sales. It is seeking to boost the figure to 35 percent by 2025 (that is, the end of the 14th Five-Year Plan). The goal is to grab more market share from established global rivals. Its sales in 2015 reached 243.7 billion yuan, up over 8 percent year-on-year, earning a profit of 16.3 billion yuan, up over 17 percent. Zheng Changhong, former CRRC\\'s deputy chairman, says the group expects a total of $8 billion worth of orders from overseas customers by the end of this year. \"The opportunities come from surging demand in both developed and developing countries for high-speed railroads, improved railway infrastructure, upgradation of subway systems, passenger services and regional connectivity, as well as their desire to create jobs and new commercial areas,\" says Zheng, who retired last week. CRRC\\'s main competitors are France\\'s Alstom SA, Germany\\'s Siemens AG and Canada\\'s Bombardier Inc. The other three have over 30 percent of international business in railway vehicles, related products, operations-related solutions and maintenance. CRRC\\'s biggest customer is still China Railway Corp, the country\\'s railway operator. Eager to enhance earnings from this fast-growing industry and prevent unhealthy competition among Chinese firms in overseas markets, the Chinese government decided to merge two former rivals, CSR Corp and CNR Corp, to form CRRC in 2015. The state-owned enterprise now has 190,000 employees and 430 subsidiaries, including five listed companies, throughout the world. Zheng says the merged entity has managed to cut overlapping investment worth 1 billion yuan, including building manufacturing facilities in a number of Chinese cities, and \"will gear up to export bullet trains, subway cars, rail technologies and equipment\". To date, CRRC has shipped and deployed its railway vehicles, parts, signalling systems, maintenance and other service businesses to markets in 102 countries and regions, accounting for 83 percent of countries that operate railway services in the world. \"The world\\'s rail-transport market is not as hot as in the past years, just like the global economy. Infrastructure construction needs money. The general demand is falling,\" says Zhao Mingde, director of CRRC\\'s strategy and planning department. \"Many foreign governments also ask us to build plants in their countries as part of the deal to continue the business.\" With a total asset amount of 22.6 billion yuan, the Chinese company has set up 56 branches such as CRRC North America or CRRC South America in 21 countries with 4,625 employees. In August, CRRC\\'s first joint venture plant in India/South Asia started operations. India has one of the world\\'s most extensive rail systems. The joint venture, CRRC Pioneer (India) Electric Co Ltd, is based in Bavo Industrial District, Haryana state, near the national capital New Delhi. The manufacturing base saw an investment of $63.4 million. The Chinese side holds a 51 percent stake in the venture. Even though CRRC has set goals to double its global sales to as much as $15 billion by 2020, Zhao said localization, quality after-sales services and reasonably-priced advanced products will be key to overcoming business uncertainty caused by declining global demand and trade protectionism in certain regions. \"Under such circumstances, we wouldn\\'t mind building \\'competitor-partner\\' relations with rivals to win bids in certain markets if it\\'s necessary,\" says Chen Dayong, general manager of CRRC\\'s international business department. For instance, CRRC and Bombardier agreed in September to expand their relationship and join forces on international bids. They will cooperate to develop the market of New York\\'s aging subway system. The Chinese company will also deliver its first train built at its manufacturing plant in Springfield, Massachusetts, to the Boston transit system in 2018. The construction work was completed in August. In March, CRRC also won a bid in Chicago to produce 846 metro rail cars, a record in the developed markets. The group now operates plants that produce electric locomotives, electric multiple units and subway trains in South Africa, Malaysia, Turkey and Iran. The goal is to tap key countries and regional markets around each plant. CRRC\\'s subsidiaries, including CRRC Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Co, Zhuzhou CRRC Times Electric Co and CRRC Sifang Co, have invested 3 billion yuan so far to acquire European technologies and manufacturing parts suppliers, including the United Kingdom-based Dynex and Germany\\'s Boge Elastmetail GmbH. CRRC Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Co, one of CRRC\\'s manufacturers mainly producing electric locomotives, is also in takeover talks with Czech Republic\\'s Skoda Transportation. Any deal would mark the Chinese group\\'s first takeover of a full-fledged rail transit equipment manufacturer. Skoda Transportation mainly produces trams, electric locomotives, carriages, electric buses, traction motors and complete drives for traffic systems. \"Widening the international sales network and manufacturing bases in overseas markets can help not only the Chinese rail equipment manufacturer but infrastructure and service providers, who can enhance their localization abilities. Expanded global play could also help gain political and public support through local employment,\" says Cheng Hui, a researcher at the Institute of Transportation Research under the National Development and Reform Commission. By 2015-end, China had built more than 19,210 km of high-speed railroads country-wide, building a solid foundation for an industry that can generate new market growth points during the nation\\'s 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) period. zhongnan@chinadaily.com.cn   ( China Daily European Weekly 12/09/2016 page26)'],\n",
       " ['What gets Harley chief\\'s motor running nan Classic motorcycle boss describes joy of riding in China, promises more dealerships in cities big and small Every morning Matt Levatich walks into his garage and listens to his three Harley-Davidson motorcycles to hear which one \"speaks\" to him. Then he picks the one that feels right for the day. A mechanical engineer by training, the president and chief executive officer of Harley-Davidson has a passion for engines, power and range. Growing up riding motorcycles, Levatich combined his business ambitions with his lifestyle when he joined the company in 1994.  - Matt Levatich, president and CEO of Harley-Davidson Inc. Provided to China Daily  He has been riding in many places around the world. One of the trips that most impressed him was in 2006, when Harley-Davidson first entered the Chinese market and he rode along the Great Wall with 30 other owners of the motorcycles known affectionately as members of Harley Owners Group, H.O.G. He has witnessed rapid expansion of the business in the past decade and has made frequent visits to the mainland. Levatich recently spoke to China Daily about the company\\'s strategy and China\\'s motorcycling culture. Following are edited excerpts from the interview. What kind of lifestyle does Harley-Davidson represent? How would you describe a person who follows this lifestyle? I think every culture has a slightly unique perspective on Harley. But what they all have as a common perspective is this sense of freedom, and a sense of identity that \"I\\'m a certain sort of person, and I wanna make a statement about who I am as an individual.\" We call it personal freedom and it\\'s the core of what the brand means for the riders.  How do you evaluate Harley-Davidson\\'s performance since it entered China in 2006? I am quite pleased to see the number of Harley-Davidson owners grow quickly in the past decade. The brand is widely known among consumers. Financially China, as a part of the Asian market, is also one of the fastest-growing markets, despite a fiercely competitive environment. We are pleased to see the passion from Chinese riders, and we are confident that more understanding of the riding culture will drive growth. Which Harley-Davidson models sell the best in China and why? The Harley-Davidson Street 750 and Sportster motorcycles are both best sellers in the China market. These two families appeal to young riders who are keen on agile and powerful rides in China\\'s urban environments. Moreover, the Street, Iron 883 and Forty-Eight models form the Dark Custom lineup - hard-nosed machines that offer an authentic, affordable experience to a new generation of riders who want to make the Dark Custom motorcycle his or her own with accessories, ingenuity or riding experiences. This aspect certainly appeals to Chinese riders. What is your vision and what are your objectives for Harley-Davidson\\'s business in China? Establishing the business 10 years ago and building it up carefully to have that level of passion in those numbers is quite remarkable. And to see them all come to the rallies and celebrate - it\\'s building the right kind of understanding and the right kind of momentum for us. We look at the Chinese market as being very important for Harley-Davidson in the long term. We have goals, and they certainly include sales and also putting dealers in tier 2 and even tier 3 cities over time. That will help us to expand our reach to people, to have access to our brand. How do accessories, clothing and other nonmotorcycle products contribute to the overall Harley-Davidson business? The whole package of the motorcycle, the rider, the experience, the fellow riders and those other items - clothing and accessories - helps create a real, richer experience for the rider. We have a relatively strong heritage worldwide. It is all about customization or personalization of the motorcycle. Have market conditions been more challenging in the past few years - or is it as friendly as before for Harley-Davidson in China? There is no simple answer. Even in the United States it\\'s been difficult when you look at the economic indicators, such as GDP, consumer confidence and so on. But the degree to which people want to spend money on a car, house, vacation or a Harley-Davidson is a function of many things. And there\\'s no refining it in this day and age around the world. There are lots of uncertainties, and all these things go into us being able to perform as a business in a world that is less predictable than it used to be. How does Harley-Davidson cooperate with its dealers? In China we already have 23 dealerships. In the future, there will be more dealerships in key cities, and we are also looking at lower-tier cities where there are increasing numbers of consumers who have embraced the riding culture. Opening a dealership like the massive and amazing facility in Beijing requires a huge investment, and we are making every effort to support our dealerships and provide best-quality products, to ensure that the investment is a success. How does Harley-Davidson fit in the context of increasing importance attached to the environment? In 2014, we introduced a demonstration of an electric Harley-Davidson motorcycle, and we took it around the world to give customers an opportunity to try it out. That\\'s because most people would say, \"I don\\'t understand.\" The other thing is when people think of an electric bike, they think of something maybe a little boring, underpowered and not fun, and we wanted to show people what is possible with an electric Harley-Davidson. The feedback has been just fantastic. They want it now and say: \"Why can\\'t I buy it today?\" But we know we can offer products with more range and lower cost and we are moving toward that. We are looking forward to launching the electric motorcycle in the next five years. How does Harley-Davidson cope with the changing tastes of riders? Is there any plan for new targeted groups such as young riders? We use products to increase the reach of the brand, and people can find their way to Harley-Davidson through different products. That\\'s important for us, not just in China but in markets around the world. Increasing the reach and impact that we can have with the product - to women, young adults, new riders and experienced riders - is about making sure that we capture their emotional excitement. We are a very emotional brand and we want to make sure we stay that way, because it\\'s a special place to be. How would you describe your leadership style? I don\\'t have an easy answer. I have incredibly high standards. I don\\'t usually come across as demanding. But there are things that need to be done in certain ways. High quality. High focus. High intensity. And these are the expectations I have for myself as a person doing anything. I think if you are going to do something, do it and do it well and get it done. I bring all that passion. Sometimes, I\\'m sure, the intensity is constructive; Sometimes, maybe less so. I\\'m just a true believer that the business has to be the best for the customer and then it\\'ll be good for the investors, good for the employees and good for everybody else. What routes in China would you like to ride in the near future? I would love to ride more in China. My son has studied Mandarin in high school and college. He spent two months with me one summer touring around China, and one summer living in Kunming. I flew into Kunming once and I thought how beautiful it was from the air. I always think to myself that it would be a great place to ride around. We have a dealership in Kunming, and we\\'ve had an event in Dali. The riding around was absolutely spectacular and the weather was great. So I had this instinct, looking out from the window, that it was a good place to ride. This is one of the great joys of my job - the opportunity to ride in these beautiful places around the world. wuyiyao@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/09/2016 page31)'],\n",
       " ['The British link nan Innovative Chinese telecom equipment-maker TP-Link plugs into UK market Chinese telecommunications equipment maker TP-Link is fast expanding into the United Kingdom, selling a wide range of networking products and championing the idea of micro innovation. Its wireless routers, power banks and other accessories may not represent groundbreaking technology, but with good design, reliable functions and value for money, they have proved popular with UK consumers. As a newcomer in the networking equipment sector, TP-Link is already the UK\\'s biggest seller of such products, with around a 40 percent market share, ahead of decades-old Western brands like D-Link and Netgear.   TP-Link\\'s booth at IFA in Berlin, the global trade show for consumer electronics and home appliances. Provided to China Daily  In an effort to constantly innovate, TP-Link also launched its smart plug in the UK, allowing devices to be controlled from anywhere. Developed through extensive research collaboration in TP-Link\\'s Silicon Valley research and development office, it now sells 120,000 units a month in the United States. \"Our brand\\'s development and global expansion rides on a wave of Chinese brands going global and Chinese technology upgrades, so we invest heavily in technology R&D and place a strong strategic focus on global expansion,\" says Nelson Qiao, TP-Link\\'s UK country manager. Founded in 1996 in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, TP-Link has grown into an industry leader in China. Its process of internationalization started in 2005 when it began selling in overseas markets through distributors. In Europe, it established a subsidiary in Germany in 2009, and subsequently expanded into the UK in 2010.  Globally, the company today has over 40 offices, with products sold in 120 countries and employing 23,000 staff. Earlier this year, TP-Link was ranked for the 23rd consecutive quarter as the world\\'s largest supplier of wireless local area network (WLAN) products by IDC Research, with a 41.2 percent global share. WLAN refers to any product that connects two or more devices using wireless technology within a small geographical space, such as a router. Qiao says one key advantage for TP-Link is product quality, combined with competitive cost and premium service. Many of its products are manufactured with top-quality components from established Western brands such as chip manufacturers Qualcomm and Broadcom. \"Our good supply chain management and manufacturing process management strategies enable effective cost management,\" he said. In addition, TP-Link constantly innovates its technology. Noticing that the smart home was picking up speed as a trendy concept, where US tech giants like Google and Amazon are pushing to the market their own systems, TP-Link developed a compatible smart plug. This allows users to switch electronic products on and off remotely using their phones. It can turn on appliances like coffee machines, washing machines, heaters and lights with a simple mobile phone command. As an endorsement for the TP-Link smart plug\\'s quality, Amazon sent an email to all its customers in the US in August to certify that the product is compatible with its smart home system. This led to big sales growth in the US. More recently, TP-Link\\'s smart plug became available in the UK through retailers like Tesco and Argos. Another example of TP-Link\\'s innovative product development is its wireless nano-router, which sold more than 1,000 units in the UK within a few months of its launch in 2012. With multiple functions, including transferring wired internet access to wireless and reinforcing the existing wireless signal, the TP-Link router is different from most others available on the British market. Other products the company sells in the UK are electronic accessories for cars, mobile devices and entertainment, such as gaming. TP-Link started to push for this market segment two years ago, with an emphasis on its products\\' ease of use and reliability.  For example, at the height of the game Pokemon Go\\'s popularity this summer, TP-Link\\'s power banks were completely sold out for a week in the UK across all major retail chains, including Amazon, Tesco, Sainsbury\\'s and John Lewis. As networking goods are TP-Link\\'s major products in the UK, Qiao says his team is also working hard to defend its market share while increasingly selling into the small business market segment. \"In the small and medium business sector, we\\'ve partnered up with many local network-installing companies, and leverage on their customer networks to reach more businesses,\" Qiao says. Qiao\\'s team places greater emphasis on maintaining relationships with these customers, providing after-sale customer support. The UK is a crucial part of TP-Link\\'s international strategy, because having a good reputation in a mature market like the UK helps it to expand into developed and emerging markets, Qiao says. In 2015, TP-Link generated revenue of $60 million (55.8 million euros; 47 million), representing 20 percent growth year-on-year. Its team of 50 staff in the UK is multicultural, with only six employees assigned from headquarters. \"The large number of local hires has led to a local culture, but we still champion many typical corporate values central to the TP-Link brand,\" Qiao says. In particular, the Chinese value of efficiency in responding to customer needs and a hardworking attitude are key, because TP-Link usually provides responses to customers within a day, and its customer service line is available 24 hours a day. \"When we get tasks done, we say we work at TP-Link speed,\" Qiao says. cecily.liu@mail.chinadailyuk.com ( China Daily European Weekly 12/09/2016 page29)'],\n",

The company, based in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, said in a filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that the deal, once completed, would make it the largest shareholder of Netas Telekomunikasyon AS. The Turkish Armed Forces Foundation will hold 15 percent. The acquisition is awaiting approval from the Competition Board of Turkey.   - Visitors look at smartphones at ZTE Corp booth at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain. In the first nine months of this year, ZTE\\'s revenue exceeded $10.35 billion, a year-on-year growth of 4.4 percent. Provided to China Daily  \"Netas is one of the largest telecom system integration companies in Turkey. Its abundant local client resources will help us grow a presence there,\" ZTE said, adding that the transaction will be paid for with internal funds. Founded in 1985, ZTE is the second-largest telecom equipment manufacturer in China, after Huawei Technologies Co. It supplies telecom products and services to customers in more than 160 countries and regions. Netas, founded in 1967, posted revenues of $371 million for the 2015 fiscal year. Its customers span telecom carriers, banks, and government agencies, ZTE said. Xiang Ligang, CEO of the telecom industry website cctime.com, says Turkey, given its geographic location, can serve as a steppingstone for ZTE to expand in the Middle East region, where demand for telecom infrastructure is rising. \"It is difficult for Chinese telecom companies to crack foreign markets on their own, due to concerns over information security,\" Xiang says. \"The investment in Netas will help ZTE better localize its products and reduce the trouble of directly dealing with local clients.\" Investors responded differently to the move by ZTE, which is listed in both Hong Kong and Shenzhen.    The company\\'s stock jumped 3.12 percent in Hong Kong to close at HK$12.56 ($1.62; 1.51 euros; 1.27) on Dec 6, while its Shenzhen-traded shares declined 0.24 percent to close at 16.29 yuan.

       " ['Airlines to take direct hit from rising price of oil nan Chinese airlines are expected to bear the brunt of rising oil prices after OPEC came to an agreement to limit production. In response, the airlines are likely to levy fuel surcharges on domestic and international flights, experts said. On Nov 30, OPEC reached a consensus on production cuts to ease excess global inventory, triggering a jump in oil prices. \"The oil price rise will have a negative effect on domestic airlines. Airlines have very weak abilities to resist the fluctuations of oil prices, and it will be a challenge to their business growth,\" says Li Xiaojin, a professor of aviation economics at the Civil Aviation University of China in Tianjin. \"Airlines should take some steps to hedge against the risks. They can prepare to levy a fuel surcharge on passengers and take other measures to reduce oil consumption, as the impact is likely to be long-term,\" Li says. Since February 2015, all domestic airlines have stopped levying fuel surcharges, as a result of the cost declines of fuel procurement. Li says that in the near future, oil prices are unlikely to surge further or drop significantly. Passengers may consider the total cost of flying, and some are likely to choose trains instead on some routes to save money. Meanwhile, Chinese airlines are also suffering the pain of a weakening yuan. In November, the yuan depreciated steadily against the dollar, beyond market expectations. That depreciation will cause exchange losses for domestic airlines. In the first half of this year, major domestic airlines, including Air China, China Eastern and China Southern, all recorded foreign exchange losses of another 1 billion yuan year-on-year - nearly half of their net profits in the first half, according to their earnings reports. \"The yuan is likely to stay weak against the dollar for awhile. Airlines need to adjust their liability compositions, speed up the repayment of dollar debts, and take other steps such as issuing bonds in yuan and loans in multiple currencies,\" said Su Baoliang, an analyst at Sinolink Securities Co. zhuwenqian@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/09/2016 page30)'],\n",
       " ['Insurers are thinking big on overseas investing nan Survey finds many reasons behind companies\\' plans to diversify assets beyond the shores of their homeland China\\'s insurers are keen to step up overseas investments in the next five years, a survey has found. BNP Paribas surveyed 12 leading domestic insurers and found they are eager to diversify assets and hedge their risks by looking at opportunities beyond popular options like real estate, listed stocks and private equity. Among those surveyed were senior executives and leaders of joint ventures. The respondents said insurers\\' overseas investments are still at an early stage. On average, only 2 percent of their investable capital is invested overseas.   - An outlet of BNP Paribas in Paris, France. Provided to China Daily  China\\'s insurers are expected to have assets in excess of 12 trillion yuan ($1.7 trillion; 1.6 trillion euros; 1.4 trillion) by year\\'s end, according to the China Insurance Regulatory Commission. It is estimated that they will have a total asset balance of around 20 trillion yuan by 2020. Insurers will likely have invested around $100 billion in overseas markets by 2020, or 2.7 times the amount invested at the end of 2015. China\\'s insurance regulator has stipulated that domestic insurers\\' overseas investments must not exceed 15 percent of their total asset balance as of the last year\\'s end. The current level - around 2 percent - is far below this, suggesting there is great potential for growth, the research report said. About 55 percent of respondents said they would like to increase overseas investments to somewhere between 5 and 10 percent by 2020. That would indicate significant growth, the report said. Some 45 percent of respondents were more conservative, saying they would like to increase overseas investment to somewhere below 4 percent. Reasons abound as to why insurers are looking at overseas markets. They include asset diversification, hedging risks, higher returns, a balanced debt ratio and a larger global footprint. \"Overseas investments will help us to obtain assets we don\\'t have in the domestic market. For example, assets of groundbreaking technologies, and assets in the sports industry,\" the research note quoted a senior executive respondent from Shanghai-based ICBC-AXA Life Insurance Company as saying.    According to Phillip Benoit, head of the APAC market, BNP Paribas: \"Like their global peers, China\\'s insurers are looking at overseas markets to diversify their investments, hedge risks and gain stable and steady income. But considering the uncertainty in global markets, currency risks and many other factors, China\\'s insurers are both aspiring and prudent.\" He says while the United States is still the most popular investment destination, Europe has a lot of good opportunities to offer with a number of undervalued assets. China\\'s insurers need to build up their in-house capacity to allocate these opportunities, Benoit says. Also, they should seek professional help to prevent regulatory risks and get local know-how before entering an overseas market. A separate research note from Z-Ben Advisors, an asset management research and consultancy services provider, said the China Risk-Oriented Solvency System, which was implemented at the beginning of this year, encourages insurers to improve their risk management, giving them one more reason to look for good assets in global markets. wuyiyao@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/09/2016 page28)'],\n",

A high-speed test line for a maglev train, with a length of no less than 5 kilometers, is expected to be completed in Qingdao of East China\\'s Shandong province by 2021. \"Even though our European rivals previously were trying to hold back our market expansion in developing wheel technology-based high-speed trains, they have failed and generally there is no European country capable of competing with China in this field,\" says Jia Limin, head of China\\'s high-speed rail innovation program. However, Japan remains a strong competitor not only in the areas of bullet train operation and development but high-speed maglev train technologies. The country plans to put its 500 km/h maglev trains with cryogenic superconducting technologies into operation by 2027.  \"Therefore, we must make a breakthrough as soon as possible to develop maglev trains that can run at speeds between 200 km/h and 600 km/h, to ensure we\\'ll have adequate market share in both domestic and global markets in the future,\" says Jia. The project will be led by CRRC Qingdao Sifang Co Ltd, one of the three subsidiary bullet-train makers. Investment in these projects, which include building of a research and development institute, will reach 3.22 billion yuan ($465 million; 431 million euros; 364.5 million). The railway major will also start R&D of cross-border high-speed trains that can run at 400 km/h and alternate between different track gauges, ranging from 60 cm to 1.676 meters. Compared with other types of urban rail transportation, maglev trains are quiet and can achieve high speeds because they don\\'t actually ride on rails with wheels but hover centimeters above the track through the use of magnets, avoiding speed-reducing friction, says Ren Jian, deputy director of CRRC\\'s technology management department. The world\\'s first maglev line was launched in Shanghai in 2002, connecting a metro station to Pudong International Airport. With speeds of up to 430 km/h, its 30-km route takes less than eight minutes to travel. ( China Daily European Weekly 12/09/2016 page26)'],\n",

Turnover on the board reached 4.65 billion yuan ($676 million; 628 million euros; 535 million), up 4.7 percent from a week ago. A total of 2,304 SMEs have been added to the board since the beginning of 2016, with combined market value of more than 3.74 trillion yuan. The New Third Board, or the National Equities Exchange and Quotation system, helps SMEs transfer shares and raise funds. McDonald\\'s to keep minority stake US fast-food chain McDonald\\'s Corp is looking to raise up to $2 billion (1.85 billion euros; 1.58 billion) from the sale of its Chinese mainland and Hong Kong restaurants after deciding to keep \"a significant minority stake in the business\", a person with direct knowledge of the plans said on Dec 6. The company has picked a consortium led by private-equity firm Carlyle Group LP and Chinese conglomerate CITIC Group Corp to buy the restaurants. Its decision to retain the minority stake lowered the price tag for the business from the possible $3 billion expected previously, said the person, who declined to be identified because details of the deal are not public. McDonald\\'s wants exposure to future growth in the world\\'s second-largest economy, which is why it decided to maintain the stake, the source said. Chinese company\\'s US deal blocked The Foreign Ministry expressed displeasure on Dec 5 after US President Barack Obama blocked a Chinese investment fund from acquiring the US business of German semiconductor equipment maker Aixtron on the pretext of national security. Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said the government had always supported Chinese firms investing overseas on the basis of market principles, international rules and respecting local laws. The Aixtron deal is purely a commercial matter, he said. Goldman Sachs sees slower 2017 growth Goldman Sachs expects China to register lower annual growth in 2017, as property and auto sales are likely to decelerate. The bank forecasts a slight slowing in China\\'s GDP growth to 6.5 percent in 2017, from a forecast of 6.7 percent in 2016. Although Goldman expects only a modest slowing in real estate investment in 2017, it sees both price and transaction growth slowing significantly, meaning a much lower contribution to China\\'s GDP growth from the housing sector in 2017. In a report to clients, the bank noted auto sales growth may slow sharply to 3 percent in 2017, from an estimated 15 percent this year, as the government is likely to cut tax rebates for auto purchases in half. Coal-bed methane production to rise China expects to increase its proven coal-bed methane reserves by 420 billion cubic meters during the 2016-20 period, the National Energy Administration said. The country seeks to extract 24 billion cubic meters of the clean energy source, and have three industrial bases by 2020, according to a development plan released by the NEA. Coal-bed methane will likely account for 13 percent of the country\\'s natural gas output by that time, according to the administration. Before new tax, luxury car sales increase Luxury car dealers in China made calls to their best prospects, urging them to buy to avoid paying extra taxes on their gilded rides. Some distributors sold as many cars on Dec 7 night as they normally deliver in three months, as buyers sought to beat the implementation of a 10 percent levy in the form of value-added tax on vehicles costing more than 1.3 million yuan, according to Wang Cun, a China Automobile Dealers Association official. Australia, China agree to open aviation Australia and China reached an agreement to open up the aviation markets of the two countries, Australian Minister for Infrastructure and Transport Darren Chester and Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment Steven Ciobo said in a statement on Dec 4. The new arrangements will remove all capacity restrictions between Australia and China for airlines, allowing Australian tourism businesses to take advantage of the largest and fastest-growing consumer market in the world.

Rovaniemi, capital of the northern Finnish province of Lapland that\\'s famous for its Santa Claus Village tourist attraction, is also the location Alipay chose to launch its 12.12 shopping festival, which gives discounts to Chinese shoppers between Dec 9 and 12 across 70,000 merchants in 16 countries around the globe. The launch ceremony on Dec 6 was attended by Rovaniemi Mayor Esko Lotvonen, some of Alipay\\'s local merchant partners and some Chinese tourists. Lotvonen said Alipay\\'s choice to launch the festival in Santa Claus Village was a token of friendship between China and Finland and his hopes to welcome more Chinese tourists.   - Merchants and Chinese tourists attend the opening ceremony of the 12.12 shopping festival at Santa Claus village in Rovaniemi, Finland, on Dec 6. Cecily Liu / China Daily  Alipay is the payment arm of Ant Financial Services Group, an affiliate of internet giant Alibaba Group Holding. Alipay has 450 million users in China and is expanding rapidly internationally, offering tourists easy and secure payment support. Now in its third year, 12.12 is a shopping festival that Alipay has used to encourage more purchases - similar to the 11.11 Singles Day shopping event in China. Whereas 11.11 focuses on online shopping, 12.12 offers are only available when making purchases offline. In Finland, Alipay cooperates with mobile payment provider ePassi, which currently works with about 10,000 merchants in Finland. When Chinese shoppers pay with Alipay, Finnish merchants will receive money in their ePassi wallets within seconds. \"Typically, Chinese travelers in Finland encounter two challenges: tourist information is not widely available in Chinese, and they often need to carry lots of cash. Alipay\\'s entry into Finland solves both challenges,\" says Alexander Yin, chief financial officer of TCG, the parent company of ePassi. Beyond payment convenience, Alipay\\'s app also provides practical information about its partner merchants in Finland, helping these merchants to more effectively attract Chinese tourists. It\\'s increasingly being embraced.    \"We are so glad to add Alipay as a new payment method, after having this request from Chinese shoppers for so long,\" says Tanja Keisu-Makinen, the Helsinki Airport store manager of Finnish watchmaker Lindroos. Tina Jokinen, the Helsinki Airport store manager for local glassworks manufacturer Littala, says, \"We\\'ve already had some Alipay transactions in our store, even though we\\'ve just launched it for a week.\" Alipay was used by 120 million customers overseas last year. It also cooperates with Germany\\'s Wirecard and France\\'s Ingenico, in a similar way to its links with ePassi in Finland. \"Alipay gives me so much convenience; it\\'s very easy to use,\" says Cao Binjie, 27, a tourist from Guangzhou who used Alipay to buy a deerskin mat, magnets and postcards from the Santa Claus Village souvenir shop. masi@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/09/2016 page27)'],\n",

Pay 10% surtax nan Move aims to curb lavish spending, but wealthy \\'won\\'t mind\\' China is levying an additional consumption tax on high-end luxury cars to curb lavish spending and emissions. But analysts say the move is unlikely to have a major effect on car sales. Starting on Dec 1, cars with a price tag of 1.3 million yuan ($189,000; 177,000 euros; 148,000) and above will be subject to an additional 10 percent tax, the Ministry of Finance said. That\\'s an additional 130,000 yuan.   - Visitors are attracted by a luxury car model at an auto show in Beijing. Cars with a price tag of 1.3 million yuan ($189,000) and above will have an additional 10 percent tax levied on them from Dec 1. Wang Zhuangfei / For China Daily  The move is to \"guide reasonable consumption, lower emissions and save energy\", according to the ministry. Bentley Motors China said in a statement that it respects and will abide by the additional tax policy, but \"at this stage, it is too early to assess the full implications on our operations\". Aston Martin China said the policy may have some impact on the brand\\'s performance in China in the near future, but the long-term effect may take time to appear. \"We constantly adjust to specific conditions in the markets in which we do business, and will do so for this taxation change in China,\" the British brand said in a statement. John Zeng, managing director of LMC Automotive Consulting Shanghai, says the new move is \"a little bit too mild\" and will not affect the sales of luxury brands such as Aston Martin, Bentley, Ferrari and Rolls-Royce. \"They have a relatively stable customer base and those who can afford a 1.3 million yuan car won\\'t mind paying an extra 10 percent,\" Zeng says, adding that any tax less than 30 percent, or even 40 percent, will not likely yield the desired results. Cui Dongshu, secretary-general of the China Passenger Car Association, says the tax hike is the latest move in the country\\'s structural reform, which is a sign of the government\\'s intention to stimulate mass consumption while curbing the consumption of luxury goods. But, he says the move\\'s effect on the overall auto market would be negligible because of the limited sales of such cars. Most super luxury brands do not release their sales figures, but data quoted in media reports show that Bentley Motors sold 1,600 cars in China last year, while Ferrari delivered 673 units. In the same year, 24.6 million cars were sold in China, the world\\'s largest auto market since 2009. Many super luxury carmakers have been eyeing China as one of their most important markets. lifusheng@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/09/2016 page30)'],\n",
       " ['Forex reserves decline by 2.2% in November nan The recent strengthening of the US dollar played a key role in the drop in China\\'s dollar-dominated foreign exchange reserves last month, but capital outflow pressure will not persist because market speculation is expected to wane after the US Federal Reserve makes its interest rate decision, said analysts. Official data on Dec 7 showed that foreign exchange reserves fell by $69.1 billion (64.1 billion euros; 54.6 billion) to $3.05 trillion in November, or 2.2 percent. The monthly dollar-dominated reserve drop came amid a strong US dollar rally, with a potential interest rate hike in the United States expected to come in the near future, according to Yan Ling, an economist at China Merchants Securities Co. The Chinese yuan depreciated by 1.7 percent against the greenback in November, during which the trading volume in the foreign exchange market increased for the third consecutive month - up by 9.3 percent month-on-month. \"But the decline in forex reserves is expected to slow in December when the market is expected to calm down after the US decision to raise its interest rate or not,\" Yan says. A string of measures on strengthened supervision for outbound investment rolled out by the central authorities aroused concerns over the government\\'s strong intention to curb capital outflows. Four top regulatory bodies tightened screening of overseas investment projects earlier this month. The National Development and Reform Commission and three other financial regulators said on Dec 6 that China will rein in risks in outbound investment, targeting speculative behavior trying to move money out of China. Ivan Chuang, vice-president of Moody\\'s Investors Service Inc\\'s Asia-Pacific Regional Management Group, regarded stricter supervision as a necessary move as the nation steps up the opening of its economy. Chuang said that he did not see the necessity for the government to control only outflows without regulating inflows. \"The government should be more willing to see balanced capital flows,\" he said. \"Although investors\\' appetites do become uncertain as a weaker yuan leads them to diversify their assets, it is understandable to see the government tightening control to fend off risks in outbound investment.\" wangyanfei@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/09/2016 page25)'],\n",
       " ['Ex-WTO chief lauds China\\'s trade nan The European Union will soon grant China the recognition it has long coveted as a market economy, former World Trade Organization head Pascal Lamy says. He made the prediction as the 15th anniversary of China\\'s accession to the organization approaches on Dec 11. Lamy, who was the WTO\\'s director-general from 2005 to 2013, said in Beijng recently that while the EU is likely to recognize China\\'s market economy status, it will also probably change its anti-dumping regulations in a nondiscriminatory way. As a condition for being admitted to the WTO, China agreed in 2001 that other members could treat it as a \"non-market economy\" for 15 years, ending on Dec 11 this year. This status has made it relatively easy for aggrieved parties to prosecute anti-dumping claims against China. Lamy says that changing anti-dumping regulations has long been a subject of debate in the EU, and changes that are made are likely to affect not only China but all other countries that trade with the EU. The EU will recognize China\\'s market economy status, he says, \"but in some way anti-dumping measures will be reformulated\". Lamy, who is now honorary president of the Paris think tank Notre Europe, played a key role in negotiating China\\'s admission to the WTO. Reviewing the past 15 years, he says China has fulfilled the commitments it made when it joined the organization. As globalization has proceeded, it has also increased the value it adds to the goods it produces, and that has been important in the country\\'s economic growth. \"China adds more value to what it produces. Twenty years ago it would import 60 and export 100, adding 40 of value to the 60 it imported. Today it imports 30 and adds 70, instead of 40, and that is good news for China,\" Lamy says. The country has pledged to open up more and wants to proceed with more economic reform, and that is a good signal, Lamy says, adding that he hopes more action will soon be taken, particularly regarding the services markets, which will help push domestic consumption and benefit Chinese consumers. \"Better service will come from more competition in the service industry. And more competition in the service industry will come with more services being imported or foreign service providers establishing themselves within the Chinese system,\" he says. The opening-up of trade is still the main trend in the world, he says, even if there is opposition in the EU to Chinese steel imports, and there is an anti-free-trade backlash in the United States. Protectionism cannot guarantee people\\'s livelihoods and social well-being but is in fact destructive and will not make a return, he says.    \"My understanding is that the connections in today\\'s world between production systems, between trade flows, between financial flows, between people flows are such that stepping back from openness would be damaging for everybody, much more than it was in the past.\" In Europe, despite Britain\\'s decision to leave the EU, things are stable, and notwithstanding some calls for protectionism, it will not increase, he says: \"Trade remains open. If you look at trade today, it is more open than yesterday, when it was more open than the day before, so the direction is right.\" While protectionism was not becoming a reality, vigilance was needed, Lamy says: \"We cannot in today\\'s world close our borders, build walls everywhere and go back to the Middle Ages.\" Reducing obstacles to trade, whether multilaterally, bilaterally or regionally, should be the common goal for all organizations, he says. And the major obstacles to trade in the future might be those stemming from differences in standards, packaging and safety regulations about how to protect consumers from risks such as safety, or traceability requirements. For each country to benefit from the opening-up of trade, they need to keep pushing to build global trade systems and environmental rules that are equitable, he says. chenyingqun@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/09/2016 page25)'],\n",
       " ['OPEC cut likely to affect upstream sectors nan OPEC\\'s agreement to curb crude oil production for the first time in eight years will have an impact on the upstream sectors of China\\'s oil giants, analysts say. Domestic oil companies that focus on upstream sectors - oil exploration and production - are likely to see an increase in revenue as the deal reached by OPEC on Nov 30 is believed designed to help bolster global oil prices, at least in the short term, says Wang Lu, an Asia-Pacific oil and gas industry analyst from Bloomberg Intelligence. \"The state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corp, which has more upstream business related to oil and gas exploration and production, will be more exposed to oil prices than its other two competitors - China National Petroleum Corp and China Petrochemical Corp,\" Wang says. The impact on CNOOC is likely to be the greatest of the three, with the recovery of oil prices improving CNOOC\\'s revenue and operating income, she said. CNPC and Sinopec focus more on downstream oil and gas sectors, including refining and marketing, which gives them an edge when the oil price is low, Wang says. OPEC will reduce output by about 1.2 million barrels per day, to 32.5 million in January.    Oil prices have dropped drastically since the second half of 2014. Oversupply and a sluggish world economy were among the factors that drove prices down. OPEC produces about one-third of the world\\'s oil, according to Reuters. However, Wang says it still takes time to tell how big the impact of the move will be in accelerating the industry\\'s recovery. \"A promise to cut is one thing; to deliver it is another,\" Wang says. \"The OPEC agreement to cut output has improved market sentiment and led to a price surge. It will take months to monitor whether OPEC members actually deliver on their promise.\" Li Li, energy research director at ICIS China, says that OPEC\\'s decision \"will surely have some short-term effect in bolstering global oil prices and helping oil and gas firms in China\". Analysts said soaring oil prices in the next three to five years would be unlikely, considering the current demand and supply situation in the oil market. US shale oil is likely to return to volume growth next year. \"US shale oil may serve as the stabilizer to oil prices and cap the amount of recovery,\" Wang says. \"All the moving parts, including the OPEC cut and demand growth, make the rebalancing a dynamic process and not easy to forecast.\" zhengxin@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/09/2016 page30)'],\n",

In addition to joint research projects and forums, universities will offer teaching and research activities comprising double degree programs, summer schools and research trips for prospective students. The Young Scholar Forum serves as the core cultural and academic exchange avenue for the association, with the Young Talent Program set up to encourage students to tap into innovative projects and startups. Among the latest efforts is the LSE-Fudan Institute for Global Public Policy, a school preparing future leaders, and contributing to global governance and public affairs. The double degree program to be rolled out next year will feature cross-disciplinary teaching and recruit master\\'s students from China and abroad. \"With China making strides on the international stage, we see pressing needs for talented people who will be able to properly present our stances in global arenas such as international organizations. That, in part, propels us to establish this joint program,\" says Jing Yijia, vice-director of foreign affairs at Fudan University and a professor at the School of International Relations and Public Affairs. A collection of scholarships is up for grabs for students to relieve their financial burdens, Jing says. The school is also mulling the possibility of offering students the option to take all courses in China but still be able to earn two degrees, which would further trim tuition fees and living expenses. \"I managed to access research opportunities at two institutions and diversify my education,\" says Che Rui, a recent graduate with a dual master\\'s degree in global media and communications from Fudan and LSE, a predecessor program that dates to 2007. Che, who now works for a well-known securities broker in Shanghai, says the double degree gives him a competitive edge in the job market. With the aid of the dual degree programs, universities can pool educational resources and use complementary teaching expertise to build study programs that they otherwise wouldn\\'t be able to offer, according to Katherine Morton, professor and chair of Chinese international relations at the University of Sheffield. \"Many Chinese students come to study at our university each year, and I expect the number to grow.

In China this year, it is taking $4 of debt to create $1 of GDP.\" The strategist, who was brought up in India (where he remains famous) but moved to the US 14 years ago, is now not as confident China will find it so easy to escape the middle-income trap, as he earlier predicted. The government\\'s own target is to achieve high-income status in 2020 by doubling its 2010 GDP. \"I think the target is a bit of a risk just because of the way the debt level has exploded from 2009 onward. So the probability of China achieving that target has declined. It might still happen, but the whole issue is that old driving slogan - it is better to arrive late than never at all.\" The book, which as usual is brimming with interesting perspectives, comes up with 10 criteria on which a country can be judged. They are: demographics; whether a country is ready to embrace reform; wealth inequality; the government\\'s role in economy; whether a country is capitalizing on its geographic location (\"The Geographic Sweet Spot\"); manufacturing investment (\"Factories First\"); inflation (\"The Price of Onions\"); whether its currency is over- or undervalued; debt; and the hype factor (how the country is portrayed by global opinion makers). \"Not all of them are original to me,\" says Sharma. \"There is a body of work done on things like low inflation or high investment. Some of it is original, like the entire chapter on The Kiss of Debt, focusing on the five-year time horizon and the increase in debt as being what matters. The idea of good and bad billionaires (wealth inequality) is a totally original concept I\\'ve tried to create. It has just not all been strung together in this format, and that is what I have tried to do here.\" He believes that China, in terms of its billionaires, has largely benefited, with a number - such as Alibaba\\'s Jack Ma - playing an influential role in the economy. The top 10 Chinese tycoons control just 1 percent of GDP in China, compared with 12 percent in India. \"The share of billionaires in the economy is at a manageable level. It\\'s not like Russia, India or Mexico where the share of wealth becomes just too large and sows the seeds of political resentment,\" he says. Sharma says the way the government has retreated from many parts of the economy over the past 30 years has also been of benefit to China. \"It went from being a very big obtrusive all-controlling state to one that has systematically reduced its share (of the economy) over time. And that has done very well for China. You have, however, seen an increase in state involvement to try and shore up economic growth as part of the stimulus.\" Sharma, also says that with recent moves like the Belt and Road Initiative, the government has tackled the problem that the west of the country is not in a geographic sweet spot, being handicapped by being landlocked. \"With the whole Silk Road project, China has made use of its geography. China has really been very good about opening up its borders compared to other countries in the region, such as India.\" Sharma says China, and Asia as a whole, have proved that to have a successful economy it is important to put \"factories first\" and have a manufacturing base, in contrast to Africa and South America. He does not believe, as some argue in Africa, that an economy can easily move from agriculture to services in one fell swoop. \"Although it sounds theoretically OK, we just haven\\'t seen any evidence of it so far. So, for now, I would say factories first.\" Sharma, an important Wall Street figure at the center of one of the top financial institutions in the US, says some of the rhetoric that has come out of Trump Tower about China does not stand up to scrutiny, particularly in regard to it being a currency manipulator. \"Anyone who knows the world knows that the Chinese currency is basically overvalued and not undervalued,\" he says. The investment strategist says it is difficult to know what 2017 will bring but he says it is wrong to assume that China can continue growing year after year without encountering a setback at some point. \"In the past 100 years the United States suffered from a dozen recessions and a Great Depression and has still managed to be the premier economy in the world. It is perfectly reasonable to expect that China will have downturns or even recessions. That\\'s just the laws of economic nature.\" andrewmoody@chinadaily.com.cn    (China Daily European Weekly 12/09/2016 page32)'],\n",
       " ['Of good deeds and online fog nan A father\\'s plea to help his cancer-stricken daughter embroiled him in controversy. The truth was uncovered by journalistic diligence. Within half an hour on Nov 30, I went on a personal roller coaster between feeling mildly good about myself to feeling duped. It was all because I had forwarded an article on WeChat. The article detailed the difficulties faced by Luo Er, a reporter in Shenzhen, whose 5-year-old daughter, Luo Yixiao, was in intensive care for leukemia. He mentioned the treatment could cost between 10,000 yuan ($1,500; 1,390 euros; 1,186) to 30,000 yuan a day. But instead of explicitly asking for a donation, he said forwarding his article would suffice, as a third party would pay 1 yuan each time it was reposted.    I normally refrain from doing such \"good deeds\" but Luo\\'s status as a journalist, his recounting of the details of his daughter\\'s situation and his noncoercion in seeking public support lent it credibility. Most crucial of all, my brother recently died of colon cancer, and I had a reflex of empathy for Luo. Little did I know that when I was reposting it to my friends on the app, the piece was being debunked: Luo had three properties in the city where real estate prices are sky high. He had vastly exaggerated his financial need. The whole thing was a scam concocted by a company whose goal was to accumulate eyeballs. I quickly deleted my post, feeling bad about anyone who might have lost money because of my impulsive act. But I also thought things weren\\'t as clear-cut as they were made out to be. Thanks to the timely reaction of local media and relevant organizations, the truth emerged the next day. And indeed, it was not all black and white. The medical condition of Luo\\'s daughter was accurate. In China, it would be a gross violation of ethics for a parent to make up such a claim. It would be seen as a curse on one\\'s child.    Luo indeed has three properties - one in Shenzhen, where the family resides, and two in neighboring Dongguan. The Dongguan apartments have not been issued ownership permits yet, which makes resale a bit hard. And all three units are far from being highly valued. Luo\\'s monthly salary is 4,000 yuan, and he is the only breadwinner in his household. It seems the family is on the lower end of the middle-class spectrum. Luo\\'s deal with a marketing firm was not complicated. The company would pay him a minimum of 20,000 yuan and a maximum of 500,000 yuan for the total number of repostings, accounting for the 1 yuan donation. But I still cannot figure out whether the donations from readers of the post would go to the firm or to Luo. Anyway, a total of more than 2 million yuan was raised before Luo told people to stop sending money. Now comes the part I would like to dwell on: the amount needed. The hospital has revealed that the total cost so far for the treatment of Luo\\'s daughter is around 100,000 yuan, and insurance has covered most of it, with Luo paying some 20,000 yuan out of his own pocket. This was later confirmed by Luo himself. This is an amount most Chinese families can afford - even without putting up any asset for sale. In the past year I have learned firsthand that money is often not the make-or-break factor in treating a cancer patient. Most people have the notion that the more money we can spend, the more likely our loved ones can be saved. But in most cases that I know, this is not true. Sure, some treatments are costly and not covered by insurance. But the cruel truth is, the miracle cure is simply not there yet for any amount of money. The rate of cancer survival depends on early diagnosis. I got Opdivo, a very expensive drug, for my brother two days before he passed away. The doctor told us that it works well for most patients with skin cancer. For others, the likelihood of a cure is very limited. Now, my sister-in-law wants to donate the remaining medicine to someone who cannot afford it. But the change of hands must be authorized and explained by a doctor, I insist, because I fear the recipient may be misled by the high value of the drug into thinking it is a panacea. I honestly believe that China\\'s medical system covers most who need help and the few who fall through the cracks can be helped by philanthropy, including online donations in small amounts. Judging from all the reports, I have a feeling that Luo did not set out to dupe anyone. When his daughter was taken into an intensive care unit, it was natural for him as a father to feel sudden despair. He exaggerated the amount needed probably because he was trying to cover future medical costs. Also, as he said, he never expected his article to go viral. Most such pleas never leave one\\'s circle of acquaintances. There is a streak in the Chinese mentality that favors exaggeration and simplification. Luo may be an example of it, but those who accuse him of various \"sins\" and \"crimes\" seem more culpable. They rely on hearsay instead of conducting investigations. The road to the moral high ground is always crowded with people who think in either/or terms. I salute those who uncover fabrications of \"good deeds\". About a year ago, there was a father\\'s post about his drive with his teenage son to the western part of Sichuan province. The son was suffering from altitude sickness, but the father didn\\'t understand. By the time they sought help at a local hospital, it was too late. The story was presented as a cautionary tale for travelers from low altitudes who are unaware of such risks. There was not a whiff of financial gain. But the hospital that was mentioned dutifully checked its records and found no such incident. To date, I have no idea what the hoax was about. Maybe it was a novelist who forgot to state he was writing fiction. In the age of the internet, even a token gesture of giving 1 yuan or forwarding a post requires a certain familiarity with journalistic ethics and properly vetting and double-checking things. I just don\\'t know whether this is a sad or glad turn for the public. By Dec 1, Luo, along with Tencent, the online platform where the fund was raised, and other relevant parties issued a statement that the money would be returned - every cent of it.

       " ['Village revival nan A county in East China is part of an effort to save centuries-old houses before they succumb to modern pressures Songyang does not even have a taxi. Located in Lishui, Zhejiang province, the county of 240,000 population is the exception in East China. Thanks to its well-preserved old villages, its people call their hometown the best kept secret in Jiangnan, a term used to describe the area south of Yangtze River, one of China\\'s most developed regions. Youtian village in Songyang has 312 registered residents. Its few old houses with yellow earthen walls and black tiles point to its centuries-old history. Today, about 10 old structures remain in the village, having withstood the vicissitudes of nature for about 500 years.   - Villagers dry newly harvested sweet potatoes under the sun in Youtian village in Lishui, Zhejiang province. Photos by Wang Kaihao / China Daily   - Youtian village has a history of more than 500 years and is now on the national list of \"traditional Chinese villages\".   \"Traditional landscapes cannot be allowed to be destroyed by urban lifestyles,\" says Ye Lianhan, head of the village committee. \"There are new houses amid the old ones, but we have reconstructed their roofs and repainted their walls to make them blend in.\" Once upon a time, Ye and other residents were faced with the dilemma of how to deal with the crumbling of many old houses. \"We feel terrible to see the old houses collapse,\" he says. \"They belong to our ancestors, so we wanted to ensure that they don\\'t become ruins.\" But the residents did not have enough money to renovate, and local cultural authorities were reluctant to finance the restoration of privately owned property. Fortunately, a trial project was launched in 2015 to save the houses before they fell apart. The China Foundation for Cultural Heritage Conservation, a Beijing-based public fund, offered an option to the villagers to renew their homes. \"We were provided with half the money we needed to restore the houses, and the rest we managed ourselves,\" Ye says. \"The villagers decided how to use their houses in the future, and renovation plans were adjusted accordingly.\" Fifty villages in Songyang, including Youtian, are now on a national list of Traditional Chinese Villages. This puts it at the top of county-level administrative regions in East China, and there are still dozens of similar villages that have not made the list yet. Meanwhile, the foundation plans to spend 40 million yuan ($5.8 million; 5.5 million euros; 4.6 million) in Songyang on the renovation of other houses in the area. The county has also set up a special administrative office to supervise the use of funds. More than 1,000 houses in 80 local communities will benefit from the money. The foundation wants to be sure that the money is spent wisely. \"Sometimes, when too much money is spent by the government on restoration, the result is often not ideal and does not cater to the residents\\' needs,\" says Li Xiaojie, chairman of the foundation. \"So, those who use the houses should have more say. It\\'s equally important to let residents live comfortably after the restoration.\" He also says that villagers may take things for granted if the government repeatedly takes the initiative to repair the old houses. Now, residents must apply for the funds, rather than being bestowed with largesse to restore their houses. Under the current project, there are 105 applicants, and renovations have begun on 42 houses. \"We would like the money to become a tool to mobilize more social effort,\" Li says. \"It is a move to seek the greatest common dividend for all concerned.\"    Though the project emphasizes the future functions of the houses, standards for cultural heritage site maintenance should still be followed, says Lu Yuanzheng, deputy director of the Zhejiang Provincial Institute of Ancient Architectural Design and Research, which is participating in the restoration. \"It\\'s like repairing the Forbidden City in Beijing,\" he says. \"When things can be fixed, they will not be replaced. And we cannot combine different architectural styles in the restoration, so we rely on local artisans. That\\'s a good chance to revitalize traditional craftsmanship.\" He admits that challenges remain. For instance, he says, if a house is co-owned by different families, the owners often have different views on how the house should be revamped. \"That is why we need a system to work out how much money is needed for each restoration,\" he says. \"A customized plan is needed for each case, but certain technical standards have to be set for general guidance.\" Songyang is currently listed by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development and the State Administration of Cultural Heritage as the country\\'s only trial region for the revitalization of traditional villages. Separately, creative thinking is being used in the renovation process. In Youtian, for example, an abandoned cowshed, which used to be co-owned by 14 families, was taken over by the village committee after paying 3,500 yuan to each family. After restoration, it was turned into a countryside inn. \"If it runs well, more villagers will see the benefits of restoration,\" Ye says. \"And more houses will be saved.\" According to Lei Chao, deputy head of the county government in Songyang, about 20 million yuan is now being allocated annually by the local government for the revitalization of traditional villages. Subsidies are also provided to residents who are running home inns, at up to 120 yuan per square meter. But restoring houses is only one piece of the puzzle for some. \"It\\'s easier to restore houses than to rejuvenate traditional lifestyles in the Chinese countryside,\" Lei says. \"The resumption of eco-friendly agriculture and traditional folk art cannot be absent.\" wangkaihao@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/09/2016 page20)'],\n",
       " ['Building character nan Some Chinese symbols take on whole new meanings when they\\'re multiplied It\\'s hard to learn Chinese, especially the characters. Sometimes it seems just like random strokes are jumbled together and given an arbitrary meaning. But in some special cases, you will find the construction of some particular characters follows a simple law - a character plus itself equals a new character. Let\\'s take the basic character äº?(r¨¦n, person, people) as an example. When one person meets another one, it becomes ä»?(c¨®ng), meaning follow, join, secondary or to act in a certain manner or according to a certain principle. The basic meaning is \"follow\", which is quite easy to understand when you see one person just appear along with another. If there comes a third person, it will then become ä¼?(zhÃ²ng), meaning many, numerous, or a large number of people. The logic is just as you may guess: Two may be company, but three is a crowd.    äººé\\x83½æ\\x9c\\x89ä»\\x8eä¼\\x97å\\x80¾å\\x90\\x91ã\\x80?R¨¦n dÅ\\x8du yÇ\\x92u c¨®ngzhÃ²ng qÄ«ngxiÃ\\xa0ng. People have a tendency to follow the crowd. The character å\\x8f?(kÇ\\x92u, mouth, hole or entrance) is another example. When two å\\x8f?come together, it is å\\x90?(lÇ\\x9a), which is mostly used as a surname. Though it has another meaning, \"temperament\", we can hardly say it has any connection with å\\x8f? Three å\\x8f?can also work. It is å\\x93?(pÇ\\x90n), which has a lot of meanings. As a noun, it could be an article, product, rank, character or quality. While as a verb, it means taste, which may be related to its radical å\\x8f?in a way. So here is a sentence: å°\\x8få\\x90\\x95æ\\xad£å\\x9c¨å°\\x8få\\x8f£å\\x9c°å\\x93\\x81è\\x8c¶ã\\x80?Lyu is sipping tea and tasting its flavor. XiÇ\\x8eo LÇ\\x9a zh¨¦ngzÃ\\xa0i xiÇ\\x8eokÇ\\x92u de pÇ\\x90nch¨¢.    Maybe you can also think of the character ç\\x94?(ti¨¢n), which looks like four å\\x8f? But actually it has nothing to do with å\\x8f? it a pictographic character, meaning field. This law of building a character can only be applied to a few characters, including the Five Elements - metal (é\\x87? jÄ«n), wood (æ\\x9c? mÃ¹), water (æ°? shuÇ\\x90), fire (ç\\x81? huÇ\\x92) and earth (å\\x9c? tÇ\\x94), which is a fivefold conceptual scheme that many traditional Chinese fields used to explain a wide array of phenomena, from cosmic cycles to the interaction between internal organs, and from the succession of political regimes to the properties of medicinal drugs. Let\\'s have a look at them one by one. é\\x87?- é\\x91?é\\x87?(jÄ«n) is the simplest one, because there is only the three-é\\x87?character, é\\x91?(xÄ«n), which means financial prosperity. Usually, you can\\'t find a word containing this character, but it is commonly used in personal or shop names. Since é\\x87?has the meaning of \"gold\" and \"cash\", for people who want money, é\\x91?is of course bliss, even compared with a single é\\x87? æ\\x9c?- æ\\x9e?- æ£?This is the one that makes the most sense. One æ\\x9c?(mÃ¹) is a \"tree\". æ\\x9c?is the radical of many Chinese characters, many of which are names of a certain plant. When fiveæ\\x9c?come together, it becomes the two-character word æ£®æ\\x9e\\x97 (sÄ\\x93nl¨ªn, forest). Individually, æ\\x9e?(l¨ªn) means wood, grove, or cluster of similar things. And æ£?(sÄ\\x93n) means \"trees growing thickly\", or \"gloomy and horrendous\". æ°?- æ²?- æ·?æ°?(shuÇ\\x90) is water, a common word. But two æ°?make æ²? which has two pronunciations, zhuÇ\\x90 and zÇ\\x90, meaning that sand at the beach that is under the ocean. This character is uncommon and almost never used in daily life. æ·?(miÇ\\x8eo) means \"an expanse of water\", and it is often used in people\\'s names. And when you come to ?, you have every right to doubt whether it is a character, as most Chinese do (it\\'s pretty rare). It is pronounced as mÃ\\xa0n, and means flood, given that so much water is gathered together. ç\\x81?- ç\\x82?- ç\\x84?- ç\\x87?ç\\x81?(huÇ\\x92) is fire; a pictographic character, ç\\x82?(y¨¢n) is scorching, or extremely hot; ç\\x84?(yÃ\\xa0n) is blaze, flame. The special one is ç\\x87?(yÃ¬), which means burning fiercely, an uncommon character again. å\\x9c?- å\\x9c?- å\\x9e?å\\x9c?(tÇ\\x94) is soil, earth, dust; å\\x9c?(guÄ«) is a tapering handheld jade tablet used by nobility on ceremonial occasions in ancient times. And if someone can pronounce å\\x9e?(y¨¢o) correctly, chances are they know a person who uses it as name. It\\'s rare, but for those who are interested, it means high mountains. Many of these characters are rarely used, except in names. To understand why, we need to go back to the Five Elements concept. It\\'s mentioned that ancient Chinese tended to use the Five Elements to explain everything, including people\\'s fate. And even today, when a baby is born, many parents will ask a fortune-teller to analyze their shengchen bazi (ç\\x94\\x9fè¾°å\\x85«å\\xad\\x97), which translates to \"the date of birth and the eight characters of the horoscope\", before naming the baby. After a mysterious calculation process, the fortune-teller will conclude that the baby lacks a certain element in life, which would of course affect their luck in the future, and the solution is to give them a name containing that element. So, you can tell that a man named å\\x9e?is very likely to have been diagnosed as lacking earth in his life, and a girl whose name is æ·?may be short of water. And if you search online, you will find some more interesting characters. For example, three horses (é©? mÇ\\x8e) make éª?(biÄ\\x81o), describing many horses galloping together; ç\\x8a?(bÄ\\x93n), made up of three cows (ç\\x89? niÃº), means \"run fast\" or \"super strong\". Let\\'s finish with a funny piece of internet slang -å\\x8f\\x88å\\x8f\\x8cå\\x8f\\x92å\\x8f\\x95. While this is often seen online, very few native speakers can actually say it. The first character, å\\x8f?(yÃ²u), means \"again\". The second, å\\x8f?(shuÄ\\x81ng), means \"pair\" or \"double\". These two are very common characters in Chinese. But the last two are not ordinary Chinese. å\\x8f?is the ancient version of \"å\\x8f?(yÇ\\x92u, friends)\"; å\\x8f? pronounced as \"ruÃ²\", refers to deep friendship; å\\x8f?has four types of pronunciation: zhu¨®, yÇ\\x90, lÃ¬, ju¨¦, and you really don\\'t need to learn its meanings, since it\\'s almost never used. When these four characters appear together in order, it means \"again and again and again and again and again \"? When think about the meaning of å\\x8f? you can easily figure out why. You can use it when you want to express a strong emotion'],\n",
       " [\"Season for chestnuts! nan Editor's note: To understand China, sit down to eat. Food is the indestructible bond that holds the whole social fabric together and it is also one of the last strong visages of community and culture. Roasted chestnuts are cold weather comfort food. On the streets of Beijing, tiny hole-in-the-wall shops with big black drum roasters or huge iron woks are once again sending out the tempting aroma of caramelized chestnuts. They are seasonal vendors. For the rest of the year, the drums are silent, the woks are cold and the shopkeepers sell dried fruits, melon seeds and other tidbits. Only after the autumn harvest does the roasting begin in earnest. If you take an excursion out to the Great Wall at Mutianyu, you can see native chestnut trees beneath your feet as a cable car carries you to the hilltop. Tourists visiting the Ming Tombs, too, may rest unaware beneath ancient chestnut trees.   - Chestnuts are often used in Chinese cuisine. Photos Provided to China Daily  But the trees are there, distinguished by their dark green ovate leaves with serrated edges, or their skinny catkins in flowering season. The easiest time to identify chestnuts is when the fruits ripen and fall to the ground. The reddish brown nuts, two to three in each thorny case, will peek through a prickly shell called the burr. In my old campus stomping grounds, there were plenty of stately trees in the park, and Asian students would gather the fallen fruits, stepping on the burrs to release the nuts to save their fingers from the barbs. American chestnuts are much larger and need to be sun-dried a bit to sweeten them. Otherwise they taste floury. We did not have the equipment to roast the nuts, so we simply cranked up the oven and baked them. I even experimented with grinding the nuts into powder and making bread and chestnut cookies, which worked pretty well. Strangely enough, no one else but the squirrels bothered to pick up the chestnuts, and so we were left to enjoy the free bounty. In China, not a nut goes to waste. Even wild chestnut trees are carefully monitored. When the burrs fall, they are hastily foraged. The best chestnuts are from Liangxiang in Fangshan, a southwestern suburb of Beijing. Liangxiang chestnuts have become well-known and are sold all over the country. They're even exported. Tianjin also produces chestnuts and the farmers there have carefully packaged their nuts in ready-to-eat vacuum packs that are sold in the city's souvenir shops. You can see these at airport duty-free shops all over China. But ask Beijing locals and they will swear by the chestnuts from Huairou, an outlying county that is well known for its trout farms and farmers' restaurants. Huairou chestnuts are smaller, but by all accounts the sweetest. Chestnuts are grown all over China, and the cultivars are all slightly different. Some are suitable for roasting, others are sold freshly shucked at markets for the cooking pot. Still others are harvested, skinned and dried to be sold all year long. The better-quality chestnuts are from Shandong and Fujian.    Chinese chestnuts are winter snacks. Whole nuts are snipped at bottom end to prevent them exploding during cooking, and are then roasted in a mixture of sand and sugar. They are sifted clean before being sold but are still characterized by the slightly gritty sticky shells. These sweet chestnuts, a deep chocolate brown and glistening with sugar glaze, are a real treat. They used to be hand fried in huge iron woks, with the vendors perspiring over the hot sand mixture, despite the winter chill. The sand helps to increase the heat needed to pop the nuts open. These days, chestnuts are mostly roasted in automated steel drums that rotate, rustling noisily as they turn. Holding a bag of hot chestnuts warms both hands and heart. And, because of the high carbohydrate content, the nuts also provide heat to the body. As the nuts cool quickly in the chilly temperatures of winter, they become easier to crack and peel, their dark brown skin coming away from the creamy yellow flesh like paper. Chestnuts are also used in cooking. They are one of the ingredients in the classic Eight Treasures Duck, together with lotus seeds, shiitake mushrooms, Chinese sausages, leeks, scallions, pine nuts and sticky rice. You could say this is the Chinese equivalent of turkey stuffing. Chinese chefs go one better. The duck is carefully boned before the filling is stuffed into the bird, steamed and then flash fried to crisp the skin before serving. Sometimes, the duck is tied at the neck and at the waist to shape it into a bottle gourd, or hulu, a symbol of good fortune and longevity. Another classic dish is braised chicken and chestnuts in an onion gravy. It is an extremely popular home-cooked dish when fresh chestnuts are in season. Unlike the French, the Chinese are traditionally less likely to use chestnuts in patisserie, but the new coffee clubs and cake houses in the cities are now pushing out a popular cake topped with candied chestnut puree similar to marron glac. This pastry first originated in Hong Kong and was in turn inspired by the classic French Mont Blanc. Chestnuts are also dried. Dehydrated nuts meant that chefs could use the nuts all year, simply soaking them in water before cooking. Dried chestnuts are sold in Chinatowns all over the world. During the fifth lunar month when rice dumplings are prepared for the Dragon Boat Festival, dried chestnuts fly off the shelves. Every savory dumpling will always need one or two chestnuts to complete the filling. Like most Chinese ingredients, chestnuts are valued for their medicinal value. Traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions use chestnuts for stomach ulcers and to whet appetites. They are believed to be a yang food and therefore good for virility. Taken in moderation, they aid blood flow and increase qi in the body. Chestnuts are also said to be good food for women, having the ability to combat anemia and improve complexions. That's very comforting to know, and for once, I'm sure, most will gladly take the prescriptions and enjoy them too. paulined@chinadaily.com.cn Braised Chestnuts with Chicken Serves 4: 12 chicken mid-wings 500 g fresh chestnuts, peeled 1 large onion, cut into thin rings (Or 10 shallots, peeled but left whole) 2 tablespoons oyster sauce 1-2 dried red chili Salt and pepper Place two tablespoons oil in a wok, heat till haze rises and add the onions. Stir fry until well caramelized. Add chicken wings and brown slightly. Add oyster sauce, dried chili and enough water to just cover the wings. Add chestnuts and bring mixture to a boil. Lower heat and simmer until the chestnuts are softened and the wings are tender. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. The onions will melt and thicken the gravy. I like using mid-wings for their collagen but any chicken pieces will do.

       " ['Old man\\'s brew tickles young nan As China continues to modernize at a frantic pace, traditional rice wine offers a new generation a chance to slow down and enjoy life David swipes his hand across the skyline of Shaoxing, Zhejiang province, as if to undo the cluster of high-rises that have shot up in the past 10 years. \"When I first came here, none of this existed. It was a sleepy town. Everything has changed dramatically.\" Standing in the usually tranquil Meilong Lake Park, the Englishman\\'s voice does battle with the gyrating guitar lines of an Australian psych-rock band whose performance at the inaugural Shaoxing MIDI festival has sent the crowd into raucous antics. Despite having lived in the eastern Zhejiang city for eight years, the Yorkshire native now finds himself in unfamiliar surroundings.   - Wu Hui\\'s tasty rice wine infused nougat sits elegantly beside a cup of sweet rice wine.  For Chinese people, Shaoxing is synonymous with the yellow rice wine locals have been producing since the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC). Suitably, amid the food and beverage marquees lining the festival field is a rice wine cocktail booth. The amber nectar is never far from the action in this pocket of East China. In fact, the very existence of the rock festival in downtown Shaoxing was catalyzed by the same authorities who have run the Shaoxing Rice Wine Festival for the past 22 years. Historically, the weeklong festival is the harbinger of winter, which means the start of the brewing season. This year, the celebrations bear a more expansive complexion: Local industry heads have seen Shaoxing\\'s GDP triple since 2011, and they hope to broaden the horizons of citizens and the reach of the city\\'s dominant industry through youth-oriented rebranding. \"This is a good turnout,\" David says, pointing to a gang of well-dressed twenty-somethings. \"It\\'s nice to see different kinds of young people exploring the city.\" The turnout was boosted by an unseasonably warm patch of November weather, but the bartender conjuring rice wine sangrias certainly helped. The Rice Wine Group organized the booth to show how modern flair can blend with tradition. \"They have 14 to 15 percent alcohol content and leave a nice taste in your mouth,\" a bartender says while preparing a rum-rice wine concoction. \"Rice wine cocktails attract many young people during the festival.\" That statement would certainly excite those involved in Shaoxing\\'s most famous industry, who long to lose the old image and appeal to younger taste buds. One such individual is Shaoxing native Bo Hong, vice-president of local brewing giant China Shaoxing Rice Wine Group. Bo is quietly passionate and swears by the health benefits of consuming a little Shaoxing spirit daily - he prefers the dry variety. Despite producing an industry high 5 billion tons in 2015, Bo is cautious in his optimism, believing things need to slow down for the rice wine industry to fully flourish. It\\'s a touching but somewhat paradoxical notion, given the helter-skelter nature of Shaoxing\\'s development. After strolling amid Shaoxing\\'s rustic, monochrome buildings, it is easy to grasp the allure of Bo\\'s point. From the hundreds of years spent producing some batches of rice wine, to the laid-back environment in which the drink is best enjoyed, the wine perfectly complements the meandering canals crisscrossing the city. \"The character of the wine is slow and mellow, exactly our marketing strategy for selling rice wine,\" Bo says. But his relaxed tone masks the proactive steps his company is taking in marketing, research and product development. The challenge for his company\\'s future is remaining relevant and appealing in a highly competitive marketplace. Currently, Baijiu, China\\'s ubiquitous spirit of choice, holds over 60 percent of the market in sales volume. Factor in the encroaching popularity of imported foreign alcohol - including wine, which saw 26.8 percent sales growth in 2015 - and the precarious position of rice wine becomes blindingly apparent.   - Hundreds of vats of aged rice wine pack the insides of warehouses on the outskirts of Shaoxing. Photos by Richard Whiddington / China daily  One reaction has been the creation of rice wine alcopop drinks, fruity low-alcohol beverages sold online and in local shops. The inspiration stems from European companies that have rejuvenated their image through similar drinks that are 3 to 7 percent alcohol. One resonant example for Shaoxing companies to learn from is Jagermeister, a German liqueur established in the 1930s as a semi-medicinal hunter\\'s brew that had an old man\\'s reputation. Another important avenue for rice wine is an improved online strategy. Online sales of tobacco and liquor products have increased by 13 percent since 2014. Rice wine companies need to develop a network of customers and offer an exciting interactive experience. \"If the rice wine industry doesn\\'t harness the capabilities of the internet, it will lose out in the future,\" says Qiu Han, executive president of Zhejiang Modern E-commerce Business Research Institute. Qiu is pragmatic in his assessment of rice wine companies and stresses the need to modernize not simply by \"culturally orienting a product to suit young people\" but through \"employing young talent\" capable of engaging customers and anticipating changes in the alcohol market. The e-commerce expert speculates that the most drastic shift rests in the rising popularity of the consumer-to-business model, or C2B. One growing facet of C2B is the creation of specialized and customized products based consumer demand. In 2014, Shaoxing experienced the online crowd-funding phenomenon. Ju Gang, a renowned product designer, sought to produce 1,000 bottles of homemade rice wine brewed using traditional techniques. Bottles were reasonably priced and sold in stylish Ge ware jars, a type of Zhejiang celadon ceramic. Demand for Ju\\'s concept soared like steam from a cup of warm wine. The bottles sold out in 24 hours, netting 99,000 yuan ($14,400; 13,500 euros; 11,400). Ju\\'s success was born of an ability to sell consumers something artsy, unique and divorced from anonymous large-scale production goods. \"The majority of consumers of personalized goods are post-1980s and post-1990s people,\" Qiu says. \"In the future it will be commonplace for large companies to customize.\" Qiu believes developing C2B avenues is more than a popularity gimmick. The flexible production model significantly reduces inventory and waste problems, thereby increasing profits. However, a full-bodied turn to modernity and the internet won\\'t necessarily uncork the industry\\'s future profits. After all, its chief commodity spends a lifetime inside storehouses - sometimes purchased a generation in advance by patrons who won\\'t ever sniff their investment. In short, it faces the paradox of needing to seem both culturally ancient and fashionably modern. This is the impression one has while exploring Shaoxing Rice Wine Group\\'s Central Wine Cellar, a storehouse 20 minutes\\' drive from downtown Shaoxing. The surroundings shift suddenly from cobwebbed rows of rice wine containers to plush, tastefully lit rooms with the latest audiovisual displays. A tour guide named Jin who has worked at the facility for more than 30 years, proudly introduces guests to one of the company\\'s most recent product developments: customization. Customers can have patterns, names or messages carved on a rice wine container by the company\\'s in-house artist. Although following the traditional B2C line, the new feature certainly offers a greater sense of individuality. Contrary to the tweaking adjustments of rice wine companies, however, are the drastic innovative ideas of individuals like Wu Hui, a local resident who has grown a business around rice wine since 2012. \"Young people have a mind for seeking novelty, and this is what we want to do when we develop products,\" Wu says. Milk tea, chocolate, nougat, ice cream, custard, pudding - name a sugary treat, and chances are Wu has already infused it with rice wine and sold it in artful packages at his two downtown stores. The product he is most proud of is a milk tea concoction consisting of a warm drink whose bottom is covered with grains of rice discarded during the rice wine fermentation process. The drink has a rum-raisin taste, and the rice adds a pleasing texture and slight sweetness. \"We keep the unique taste of rice wine and the sweetness of the milk tea at the same time,\" Wu says. In perhaps the ultimate compliment, major rice wine companies have begun mimicking some of Wu\\'s products with rice wine popsicles and milk teas available at the China Yellow Rice-Wine Museum. However, in crucial ways they are merely following fumes rather than making the brew. Without a traditional factory, and by building a thriving online platform, Wu stands at the vanguard of rice wine\\'s image shift. His asset-light, flexible business model is implausible for the industry\\'s big players, but if he can successfully continue his mission of novelty and creativity he\\'ll help them prove Shaoxing rice wine is so much more than an old man\\'s favorite nightcap.

       " ['Stick to the rules. Witch rules? nan Books gave birth to a sport for those who lack the magic touch One afternoon recently two young women walked into a shopping mall in the Liudaokou area of Beijing. When they arrived on the third floor, they made a beeline for a deserted corner that was being redecorated. \"This is the place,\" Li Yangdan, 26, told her companion, Liu Yiying, 22. Out of their bags they took black gowns and proceeded to put them on. Then the pair, now transformed into witches, took out their wands. That may sound like a scene from a Harry Potter novel, in which the magic world is invisible to muggles, or ordinary people who lack magic powers. But despite being muggles themselves, and therefore unable to fly on their broomsticks, Li and Liu play Quidditch. They are the founders of the Beijing Quidditch Club and were in the shopping mall to shoot a short video for a company. In late 2011, when Liu, who is from Chengdu, was still a high school student at Hangzhou Foreign Languages School, her schoolmate Wang Jiasheng returned after studying in the United States and introduced muggle Quidditch to the school. At the time, Liu had been admitted to Peking University and, like many of her schoolmates, she was not obliged to take national college entrance examinations, so they started playing the game with students from other grades. Each of the players has to ride on a broom while running instead of flying. There are seven members on each team - one seeker, three chasers, two beaters and one keeper. A team can have both males and females.    Unlike witches and wizards, muggles have to use a white volleyball to replace what is called a quaffle in the books. If chasers throw the quaffle into one of the three rings of the rival team, the team gains 10 points. Similarly, muggles use soft volleyballs to represent what are called bludges. Beaters throw the balls onto the members of a rival team to knock the targeted ones temporarily out of the game. The golden snitch is a tennis ball contained in a sock that is fastened to the waist of a person, supposedly one wearing golden clothes who is good at escaping. When a seeker catches the golden snitch, the game is over and the seeker\\'s team wins 30 points. The game, first played by students in Middlebury, Vermont, in 2005, has become popular with students in Europe and North America. It is reported that globally there are more than 4,000 Quidditch players in more than 300 teams. \"It is a very intense sport, combining American football, basketball and soccer,\" Liu says. \"A lot of universities in the US have their own team.\" Before Li met Liu in Beijing in 2012, Li was an experienced player. \"We used to play online through group chatting and instant messages. We input words stating our positions and movements, and referees would say who got the balls and who scored first by the time we sent the messages. It was awesome and your fingers and your internet had to be fast.\" In the fall of 2012, when Liu came to Beijing to study at Peking University, Li, then a graduate student at Beijing Jiaotong University, found her, hoping to be able to play Quidditch with her. That\\'s when they formed the Beijing Quidditch Club. Coincidently, a company saw Li\\'s Weibo microblog that said she also wanted to play Quidditch and decided to support her. As a result, they got the equipment for the game from the company - six hula hoops, six sticks, six parasol bases, volleyballs, soft volleyballs and tennis balls, and another 60 people who were either were curious about how to play or wanted to play. After the first event, they didn\\'t have another game until the Beijing International Film Festival in June 2013, when Harry Potter fans could watch the eight films of the series over three days. Li and Liu met many other fans at the festival, and they later became club members. In November 2014 the club organized its first league matches. Students from Peking University, Beijing Jiaotong University, Central University of Finance and Economics and China Foreign Affairs University formed four teams. After preparation and training in September and October, they played three games, and the team from Peking University won the final. Over the past two years the club has organized several activities to publicize the game. The club has more than 100 members, including students and people who have jobs. Over the past several years there have been comings and goings. \"We have become great friends and often go to other activities, such as Harry Potter fairs and parties, as well as playing Quidditch,\" Liu says. In China there are only a few teams so far, in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou. \"But our long-term goal is to bring our teams out of Beijing to compete in the international arena,\" Li says. Then the two waved their wands, and like magic, the video shoot instantly began.  (China Daily European Weekly 12/09/2016 page16)'],\n",

China made the debt cancellation move at the start of the president\\'s six-day visit to the country that marks the 45th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries. \"We welcome such a pronouncement because it is helping us out of a very difficult situation. Giving us this relief will help us address other important issues,\" he says.   - Sierra Leone President Ernest Bai Koroma says the country\\'s economy is now on target to grow 4.7 percent this year and by 5.4 percent in 2017. Wang Zhuangfei / China Daily  Sierra Leone\\'s was one of the fastest growing economies in Africa in the past decade but was hit by two devastating events, the collapse of the price of iron ore, its main export, and the Ebola epidemic, which killed 3,590 people. Its GDP contracted 21.5 percent in 2015. Koroma, who was speaking at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, says the crisis facing the country was extremely challenging. \"It has been very difficult but with the support of friends like China we have been able to roll out programs of recovery to restore our utilities, get our services back and provide support for our private sector to get the market properly operating again,\" he says. Koroma, who has been president since 2007, says the economy is now on target to grow 4.7 percent this year and by 5.4 percent in 2017. \"This shows that although, yes, it has been difficult, the measures adopted, including austerity ones, have resulted in things taking shape and in the not too distant future we will be able to restore ourselves to pre-Ebola status and become one of the fastest growing economies in the world again.\" One of the biggest investors in Sierra Leone is Shandong Iron and Steel, which owns the country\\'s Tonkolili iron ore mine. It ceased production during the Ebola crisis but resumed activity last year. The president made a visit to Shandong on Dec 3. \"We need to visit them to encourage them to scale up their activities. The projections they have made before they are not currently hitting. We are therefore looking for assurances,\" he says. Koroma welcomed China\\'s commitment to Africa and, in particular, Chinese President Xi Jinping\\'s trebling of funding support to $60 billion (55.6 billion euros; 47.4 billion) at the second Forum on China Africa Cooperation Summit (FOCAC) in Johannesburg in December last year.    FOCAC has itself enhanced the relationship between China and Africa with President Xi escalating it to the highest level of comprehensive strategic and cooperativity partnership and giving his support for Africa playing a bigger role internationally, he says. During his visit an agreement was also signed by the two sides to support the establishment of a center for disease control in the country. \"Ebola is new to us all, including China at the time, and we have learned lots of lessons and are still learning. There is no complete study on Ebola but this is an opportunity for us to continue to study the virus.\" Koroma, who was a senior insurance executive before he became president, believes in developing a market-led approach to Sierra Leone\\'s development. \"We have an open market and we want to create an environment that is friendly and supportive to external investors. We are not an exclusively a Chinese market. We have other players but it seems that the Chinese are getting an upper hand,\" he says. Koroma says he hopes some Chinese manufacturing - particularly in resources processing - will now move to Sierra Leone as it has done to some other African countries such as Ethiopia, famous for Chinese shoemaking. \"We believe that should be the next step. These are the issues we are now looking at,\" he says. The president says he is also optimistic for the future of the continent, despite the commodities recession denting the frequently vaunted \"Africa Rising\" narrative of the last decade. \"The future of Africa is still bright. We still have the world\\'s largest supply of arable land, are home to a good number of mineral resources. Oil and gas is discovered regularly and we have marine resources in abundance. We just need to develop them to the fullest,\" he says. andrewmoody@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/09/2016 page15)'],\n",

The confession in 2005 of another man, Wang Shujin, who claimed he was the actual murderer, gave her additional power and courage to continue. In March 2005, Zhang hired a lawyer and began the legal process to clear the name of her son.

A white paper released by the State Council Information Office on Dec 7 outlines China\\'s efforts to promote international exchanges and cooperation in TCM. The paper, Traditional Chinese Medicine in China, says its use has spread to 183 countries and regions. According to the World Health Organization, 103 member states have given approval to the practice of acupuncture and moxibustion, 29 have enacted special statutes regarding traditional medicine and 18 have included acupuncture and moxibustion treatments in their medical insurance provisions, the white paper says.   - Visitors at a TCM museum built by the state-owned Chinese medicine company TRT Group in the Republlic of San Marino. Xinhua  Moxibustion involves burning herbs and applying heat to the body to increase vital energy flows. TCM has gradually gained more international acceptance, and some practices have been recognized by authorities in Russia, Cuba, Vietnam, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates and other nations, according to the white paper. \"We have established 10 TCM centers outside China, and all of them are popular among locals,\" Wang Guoqiang, head of the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, said at a news conference on Dec 6. \"Governments of 86 countries and regions have signed agreements with the Chinese government on TCM cooperation.\" Many countries have expressed hopes of working more closely with China since traditional therapies are both effective and easy to apply, and the low cost means they can help control ballooning health expenditures, he said. In China, the number of practitioners and assistant practitioners of TCM reached 452,000 as of the end of last year, the report says. Medical care services provided by TCM institutions in the national total increased from 14.3 percent to 15.7 percent in the few years from 2009 to 2015.    Last year, outpatient expenses per visit and inpatient expenses per capita at public TCM hospitals were, respectively, 11.5 percent and 24 percent lower than those at general public hospitals, according to the white paper. \"Development of traditional medicine is a global trend, and it is natural that TCM is drawing more attention from the world,\" Wang said. TCM drew worldwide attention in August, when images of purple circles on the back and shoulders of US Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps were widely circulated. The circles were caused by traditional cupping therapy, practiced in China for more than 2,000 years to relieve pain and boost the metabolism. Also, Tu Youyou, a Chinese researcher, shared the 2015 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine after isolating the anti-malaria drug artemisinin from sweet wormwood, long used in traditional medicine. She became the first Chinese national to win a Nobel Prize in science. Some TCM techniques, such as acupuncture, have been adopted by many countries and are popular with locals, according to Yang Zhen, an associate professor at Beijing University of Chinese Medicine and a certified acupuncturist in California. But use of traditional Chinese medicines is not as widespread as it could be due to such factors as a lack of scientific research on the medicines and the fact that they often are not covered by medical insurance, he says. wangxiaodong@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/09/2016 page13)'],\n",

With more than $3 trillion (2.79 trillion euros; 2.373 trillion) in total market capitalization ($16 trillion for New York, by comparison) and robust trading - of which around half is by investors from the outside - Hong Kong is an important capital market in the world.    The Chinese regulatory authorities are commendable for linking up the two domestic stock markets with a more open and mature market like Hong Kong to help reform the trading culture in the domestic markets in such a way as to be closer to international rules and norms. Furthermore, the timing for setting up the stock trading connection is also important - for investors to evade some risk in currency exchanges and also to avoid putting all their eggs into one basket, meaning the basket of the US dollar and US market. At the moment, as ample signs are suggesting a rally in the dollar (against all other major currencies) and a rally in American stocks - potentially benefiting from the tax cut and investment hike in public infrastructure that Donald Trump promised - it may be hard for investors in the world to resist the temptation for converting their money into the greenback. For some time now, China's foreign exchange reserve and its renminbi's price against the dollar have both been on the decline, because Chinese money has been used for overseas buyouts of assets in large volume. But the Chinese companies' overseas buying spree cannot be sustainable, judging from the trend emerging in the United States. Assets are becoming more expensive. Government is becoming restrictive. If the American rally continues, liquidity will have dried up a few months from now and investors will be forced to give up some of their interests. Many Chinese investors are already talking about the need to deleverage before it is too late.    For them, foreign currencies, especially the dollar, will be more precious. But the renminbi won't become less significant simply because of its falling exchange rate against the dollar in recent months, because it is still relatively stable compared with other currencies' rate against the dollar. Both its economic growth rate and currency stability can make China a useful hedge against the United States, as Sun Mingchun, chairman and chief investment officer of Hong Kong-based Deepwater Capital, pointed out. In case of instability in America, either in the dollar or its stock market, investors may find China, especially its freer and more orderly market in Hong Kong, a worthy place to be - so long as China can maintain a basic balance in its own economic transition. At least in the foreseeable future, one can be almost certain that China's three stock markets combined can be a more attractive market than many other places. With Hong Kong's stock trading connections with Shanghai and Shenzhen, Chinese investors will not have to exchange all their money into dollars at this time of uncertainty but still chase the value in a dollar-denominated market - which is part of Hong Kong's uniqueness. This is because, first, the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US dollar in its exchange rate and the Hong Kong stock market is a highly international one. Second, the trading connections with the mainland don't require investors to exchange their money when they invest in Hong Kong. Given some time, the existing trading connections can easily expand their functionalities by facilitating trade in bonds and in international investment funds, thus making the entire Chinese financial system more open and more agile in correcting its excesses.

       " ['Deliver us from these robot postmen nan Dinner by automaton? Parcels by drone? It\\'ll never catch on - or will it? Maybe China has the perfect solution Driving through the east London suburb of Greenwich to pick up my wife from the station the other evening, I pulled up at a pedestrian crossing to allow a man using a mobile phone to cross, along with what I thought was his companion. However, the \"partner\" wasn\\'t anything to do with him. It was a six-wheeled fiberglass box with a whip aerial and it seemed to have a mind of its own. The pedestrian walked off in one direction and it went in the other. I sat mesmerized by this apparently remote-controlled device trundling along the pavement until it turned a corner and vanished. I didn\\'t know it at the time but I\\'d just watched part of an experiment in the high-tech Millennium Greenwich village to deliver hot food by remote control.    The idea is simple - you phone the delivery company for, let\\'s say, a Chinese meal. The food is put into the little truck and locked with a code. The truck heads off to the address, where the recipient - alerted by text message - opens the box with the code and takes out the meal. The device is steered by commands that take it to pre-programmed coordinates, and sensors make sure it doesn\\'t bump into anything en route. What could possibly go wrong? In the big wide open spaces of the rural United States, Amazon is experimenting with small drones that carry boxes, up to a certain size and weight, and deliver them to pre-programmed addresses using a sophisticated form of GPS. Given the enthusiasm in some states in the US for their right to bear arms, I think you\\'ll find these drones will make ideal targets. I can\\'t see the drone idea or the remote food buggy working in the urban jungles of Beijing or Shanghai. How on earth will a drone figure out how to reach Mr and Mrs Wong on the 64th floor of a tower block? China, however, with that brilliant problem-solving trait that seems to pervade the country, has come at the delivery problem from a different angle. If Muhammad won\\'t come to the mountain, then take the mountain to Muhammad. When I spent a few weeks in Beijing earlier this year I was fascinated by the arrival in the early morning of fleets of those pesky electric delivery tricycles that you can\\'t hear coming, pulling up outside the offices of China Daily in Chaoyang district. I was equally fascinated by the queues of employees lining up to take their parcels.    Later, colleagues enlightened me. Let\\'s say you order something online at 9 pm but you know you have to be work the next day and your boss isn\\'t going to buy the old \"I have to stay home to wait for a delivery\" line. Plus, the delivery guy isn\\'t ready to deliver to the 64th floor of a tower block. Instead, a time is designated outside the office and you collect your parcel. And it\\'s free. In the competitive world of internet commerce, that\\'s a plus. Of course, it could lead to anarchy. In Beijing, the authorities have moved to try to bring a sense of order after reports of tricycle drivers racing to meet tight delivery deadlines, ignoring red lights and riding in bicycle lanes. So although the actual status of these machines has yet to be defined - Motorized? Nonmotorized? - the authorities now require them to clearly carry a registration mark, and their appearance will be standardized, as well as the drivers being issued a card with a code of conduct on it. So far, according to a report by one of my colleagues, the authorities have so far brought 57,000 tricycles from 40 delivery companies into the scheme. Me? I have a very good relationship with my postman, who delivers on foot regularly, six days a week, come rain, sun or snow. Also, he talks. I don\\'t see him being replaced by a robot anytime soon.

       " ['Another Silk Road is needed to defeat terror nan High on the hills between Jerusalem and Bethlehem, someone has scrawled some old wisdom on the concrete barriers that slice across the old Green Line: \"All walls fall\". One can but hope. With Donald Trump now heading for the White House, there is a clear and present danger that America will double down on the neoconservative \"clash of civilizations\" philosophy that the self-styled Islamic State uses to recruit its foot soldiers of hate. IS commander Abu Omar Khorasani has already declared the \"maniac\" in the White House will increase terrorist numbers by \"thousands\". This is a dangerous moment. Figures from the Global Terrorism Index reveal IS is now the deadliest terror group on earth. Its attacks on 252 cities last year killed more than 6,000 people. Yet what we face in the Middle East is an insurgency. No-one can kill their way to victory. Peace will require politics, and good politics needs prosperity. That is why it is time for the West to take a leaf out of China\\'s book and establish a complementary vision for a new Silk Road, to match the ambition set out by President Xi Jinping in 2013. In the long term, our best defense against a fanatical Middle East is a flourishing Middle East. Today, the cancer of poverty and inequality is as dangerous as any religious division. Yet, the low long-term oil price is fast becoming an existential threat to regional stability. In many Gulf states, 60-80 percent of people are employed by the public sector. Collapsing oil tax revenues means Arab countries can no longer afford this. The International Monetary Fund forecasts that by 2021, a third of young people may be unemployed. Over the last 10 years, the United Kingdom has spent nearly 15 billion ($19 billion; 18 billion euros) in aid to countries in the Middle East and South-east Asia. But there is no strategic intent behind it, no grand effort to transform our economic relationship or to build infrastructure that might help countries trade and prosper. This is why we should learn from the first fruits of China\\'s Silk Road Economic Belt vision that we have seen this year: the new sea, road and rail connections that are transforming the costs of trade across the 65 Eurasian countries described with such wonder by Marco Polo. Many of these are nations that IS wants to sweep into a new theocratic caliphate in which it would wipe out the extraordinary diversity of modern Islam. Today, we think of globalization as something new. In fact, it was slowly invented on the trade routes that connected Europe, the Middle East and China. Along these roads moved trade, innovation, ideas, culture - and trust. As we seek new security for new times, this history has much to teach us. The author is Labour MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill.

       " ['A shift toward climate leadership nan Amid global uncertainty about future US policy, China could set the pace for environmental action Implementation was the keyword for the 22nd Conference of Parties meeting (COP22), recently held in Marrakech, Morocco. In October, 113 out of 197 parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ratified the Paris Agreement, representing 80 percent of global CO2 emissions. Following this achievement, two urgent matters lie ahead: the development of elaborate and concrete road maps to achieve the goals set in the agreement and fulfilling what is left in the Kyoto Protocol. Marrakech was, without doubt, the beginning of the post-Paris era. Climate finance was under the spotlight during the conference, discussed widely across national pavilions and at side events. Deep concerns were shared by developing countries, especially the least developed and most vulnerable. Although developed countries promised at Copenhagen in 2009 to give annual aid of $100 billion (94 billion euros; 79 billion) from 2010 to 2020 to help developing countries cope with climate change, so far there is still an annual $40 to $70 billion gap to fill. Additionally, this is only the financing shortage within the Kyoto time frame. The world is facing an even bigger challenge when it comes to the Paris Agreement. Last year, before the Paris Conference, developed countries, led by the European Union and the United States, secretly formed a \"high ambition coalition\" with 79 African, Caribbean, and Pacific countries, but excluding China and India. The group emerged at the end of the conference to push for a legally binding plan to hold the global temperature increase to within 1.5 C by 2100, instead of the former agreed target of 2 C. The final version of the Paris Agreement, therefore, states \"pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels\". This plan serves the best interests of vulnerable countries. But the climate finance conundrum dragged the ambition down to earth at COP22, with the name \"Donald Trump\" contributing to the process. Noticeably, the landscape of climate leadership is shifting toward the east. China was widely expected to play a leading role at COP22, an expectation reinforced by the pessimistic atmosphere created by Trump\\'s election. Over the years, China has indeed proactively helped other developing countries on climate change. From 2011, China has invested more than $1 billion to help African and vulnerable countries. In last year\\'s US-China Joint Presidential Statement on Climate Change, China committed to establishing the South-South Cooperation on Climate Change Fund and to provide $3.1 billion in three years. This will finance programs including infrastructure construction, personnel training and capacity building in developing countries. At COP22, this commitment was strengthened again by Xie Zhenhua, China\\'s special representative on climate change affairs, during the High-Level Forum on South-South Cooperation on Climate Change, which was the most important event in the China pavilion. During the forum, the COP22 president, UN officials and dozens of ministers from developing countries shared their views and visions on south-south cooperation and China\\'s positive role in it. By incorporating climate change in south-south cooperation, China expanded the scope for foreign aid, which is widely recognized as an important strategy in every country\\'s foreign policy portfolio. The poor and vulnerable countries cry for money, technology and expertise to adapt to climate change and develop a green economy. In this sense, conventional foreign aid targets such as poverty, health and education can be considered more broadly as climate change issues. Geopolitically, large powers compete for greater influence in global governance through foreign aid programs. The gap in climate financing therefore offers considerable opportunities for competitive donors to influence the climate agenda and international affairs more generally. In this potential competition, China has many advantages, including empathy for the need for economic development and the necessity of cooperation. This has resulted in China\\'s \"assistance-plus investment\" foreign aid model. International opinion on China\\'s foreign aid, however, is extremely polarized. Some argue that China\\'s no \"strings attached\" approach is efficient and generates win-win outcomes. Others criticize this direct, economically-driven assistance as a form of neocolonialism. Unarguably, China\\'s influence on less-developed countries has been growing rapidly, along with growing concern from the West. The reasons behind this come not only from concerns that China may undermine the democratic process of these countries but also, and more important, from the fear of losing advantages they earn from their own foreign aid programs. The elephant in the room at COP22 was the question, Does Trump fear losing these advantages? He claimed on the campaign trail that he would halt US funding for UN climate change programs, seemingly undermining US President Barack Obama\\'s original commitment of $3 billion. What he will actually do once in office remains to be seen. Regardless, China is taking on a growing leadership role in global climate governance. It is inevitable that the shifting landscape toward China\\'s leadership will put pressure on the US in terms of its global image and influence. The world can only hope that, as a self-proclaimed successful investor, Trump will come to agree with Obama that climate finance is \"a smart investment for us to make\".

       " [\"Tell Santa you want something Chinese nan Strong tradition of family togetherness means Asian products make perfect Christmas gifts More and more Chinese brands are now positioned as Christmas gifts. Not only are increasing numbers of Chinese companies building brands around the world, they are increasingly tuned in to the festive mood across Europe at this time of year. Leading the pack, by a country mile, is London-based Chinese luxury brand Shanghai Tang. Just a cursory glance at the Shanghai Tang website reveals a clear shift in brand positioning, with Christmas gift-giving central to its current theme.    Most prominent on the website is the Christmas Gift Collection for 2016, which presents an amazing array of luxury clothing and accessories. Shanghai Tang sets a fine example of the highest quality and presentation levels we now see across European markets where Chinese brands are concerned But crucially, Shanghai Tang leads the way in pursuing brand building via Chinese associations, many of them traditional. European consumers are now aware of this Chinese theme and will, without hesitation, purchase a Christmas gift with a Chinese image. Shanghai Tang has, in effect, uncovered and ignited a hitherto dormant desire among European consumers. Not that this desire extends only as far as clothing with traditional Chinese patterns, which are very much the cornerstone of Shanghai Tang's brand strategy. The company currently offers a full range of luxury fashion accessories and even traditional Chinese tea, all very much presented as Christmas gifts. But why does it appear that European consumers are eager to buy Chinese brands as Christmas gifts? Of course, it may just be a trend, a new way of finding interesting gifts for friends and family. But it is a finding of my ongoing research on the changing perception of Chinese brands across Europe and the West generally that European consumers are increasingly attracted to China - and Chinese culture in particular. I strongly suspect that it is admiration and respect for traditional Chinese culture and family cohesion that has led to the ready and enthusiastic acceptance of Chinese brands as Christmas gifts. Furthermore, Europeans are envious of the cohesive and caring nature of extended Chinese families, where several generations maintain unbreakable bonds.    Across Europe, gift-giving at Christmas often revolves around families, and extended families in particular, where an annual coming together takes place. It may well be that the handing-over of Chinese brands as gifts at this time to family members, especially infrequently visited distant family members, goes further toward a more close-knit family and brings extended families closer in a far more meaningful way. While Shanghai Tang and many other Chinese brands that position themselves as gifts for European consumers at Christmas time have made great progress in recent years, there is room for far more emotional meaning here. Shanghai Tang and others should be providing clear visual traditional Chinese associations alongside their brands and highlighting clearly the family togetherness - extended family in particular - that these brands represent. Often the most valued Christmas gifts are those that are consumed more or less immediately and shared among the family and extended family. Such gifts are even more valued as contributors to family togetherness when they also contribute to a relaxing, happy atmosphere. This brings us on, rather naturally, to Chinese green tea. Often touted by leading authorities, such as the World Health Organization, as one of the healthiest dietary accompaniments, Chinese green tea also carries an unrivaled image of peace and serenity. What a perfect opportunity for an extremely highly valued family Christmas gift where the vast majority of European families could accept and enjoy Chinese green tea consumption as a major part of their Christmas family fun and relaxation. Disappointingly, to date very few genuine Chinese green tea brands have found their way to prime locations among major European retailers. But for European Christmas gift-givers there are numerous specialist retailers online who provide a wide choice of some of the finest Chinese green tea brands. European retailers have ventured into the green tea market but, despite impressive efforts, they can't seem to match the emotional association and quality of the best Chinese brands. European retailers sell their own label green tea products. Chinese providers offer the most emotionally associative brands worldwide. Some of the best known brands in Chinese mainland would probably find European market penetration easiest, given their rich history and associations. These brands also possess the financial muscle to build brand awareness across very competitive European markets. Long Jing pan-fried green tea from Hangzhou, capital of eastern China's Zhejiang province, ranks as one of the brands that enjoys top awareness. Not far behind are Chinese Bi Luo Chun, from central China's Jiangsu province, and Tie Guan Yin, a type of oolong tea from East China's Fujian province. It is these brands, and not the craftily contrived Western retailer versions, that will attract European consumers in search of that perfect Christmas gift to be enjoyed by the entire family, in much the same way as it is across Chinese mainland on a regular basis. Chinese brands as Christmas gifts, therefore, deserve to take pride of place at a time of family togetherness. But Christmas is also a time for romantic, gifts and Chinese brands also have competitive offerings here. The perfect romantic gift for European female loved ones at Christmas is the traditional Chinese dress known as the qipao. This elegant item is also symbolic of traditional China and Chinese culture, something that European consumers perceive as increasingly sophisticated and stylish. The qipao, which dates back to 17th century China, is traditionally made of silk with decorative and ornate embroidery. Trimmed at the collar and sleeves, this is the dress of empresses. Opportunity also knocks for romantic Europeans searching for that perfect Christmas gift for male loved ones. Often cited as the male version of the qipao, the changshan presents an opportunity for style and sophistication in the form of a traditional male Chinese clothing item. Even though traditional Chinese clothing has not found its way into European shopping centers and the best-known fashion stores, the qipao and the changshan can be found very easily with a quick and simple online search. There is a significant overlap between the emotions aroused at Christmas time in Europe and traditional Chinese culture. Both revolve around family togetherness, belonging and romantic feelings for loved ones. Chinese brands, especially those infused with traditional Chinese associations, possess a considerable and natural competitive advantage, therefore, when positioned in the minds of European consumers as Christmas presents. For European consumers, the perfect Christmas gifts that will lead to the most meaningful family experience have to include more than a few Chinese brands. Christmas gift-giving and traditional Chinese culture share many similarities. Chinese brands, therefore, could be part of that perfect family time.

       " [\"China, EU should team up on internet security nan Did Russian government hackers influence the outcome of the presidential election in the United States? Or are the allegations just another urban legend, launched by Americans unhappy with the outcome? There will probably never be certainty. What is certain, however, is that the internet is much more vulnerable than we used to think. Cybersecurity is rightly one of key topics for discussion at the Internet Global Forum, the annual get-together of all internet stakeholders, in Guadalajara, Mexico. Cybersecurity is a global issue; it requires a global response. In the early 2000s, the European Union set up a specialized agency to promote common approaches and to exchange best practices in the EU - the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security, or ENISA. The ENISA worked closely with the governments of EU member states and the private sector to deliver advice and solutions. For example, it hosted the pan-European Cyber Europe Security Exercises in 2010, 2012 and 2014. It also advocated the development of national cybersecurity strategies, which are now mandatory in the EU under the recent Network and Information Security Directive. In parallel, ENISA developed a methodology to identify critical communication networks, links and components - dependencies on communication networks of critical infrastructure, such as electrical grids.    ENISA disseminates its cybersecurity expertise through studies. For example, it published a study on secure cloud services, addressing data protection issues, privacy enhancing technologies and privacy on emerging technologies, electronic identity cards and trust services, and identifying the threat landscape. Another example is the report Communication Network Interdependencies in Smart Grids, which was published in January. It's mainly directed at smart grid operators, manufactures and vendors, as well as tool providers. The mandate of the ENISA will lapse in June 2020 and the EU is reflecting on its future mandate. Most of the reflection is focused on ENISA's future tasks, now that the network of national computer security incident response teams is in place. Insufficient attention was given to the possibility of widening the geographic scope of its mission, in view of the global nature of internet security.    At the Trust Tech event in Cannes, the China Information Technology Industry Federation, or CITIF, highlighted the urgent need to establish a professional and perfect information security personnel training mechanism in China. The federation also bemoaned the fact that China's information security awareness lagged behind the world average, and that very few countries purchase information security services. The Chinese government pledged to make network and information security a national strategy and has already introduced a series of policies and taken other steps to strengthen information security and promote the development of an information security industry. But why do it all alone? Why not make use of the re-evaluation of the ENISA to transform it into a Chinese-European agency for network and information security, or CENISA? The legal basis of ENISA could evolve from an EU regulation to an international agreement between the European Union and China, which could eventually be joined by other countries, for example the UK after its exit from the EU. The new body would build on the current practice and expertise of ENISA to promote network security through: Recommendations; Activities that support policy-making and implementation, such as exchanging best practices and coordinating global security exercises; Hands-on work, where CENISA would collaborate directly with operational teams in China and the EU. Such reforms would be only first steps toward greater internet security, but would confirm the commitment of the EU and China to work together for a more secure internet.

       " ['Europe\\'s shaken belief in its stability nan Contradictory poll results sow seeds of doubt throughout a continent more accustomed to predictability Looking back over 70 years of post-war history, most Western Europeans would conclude that political instability is something that happens somewhere else. Now, however, following the Brexit vote in Britain, a referendum upset in Italy and the prospect of untested populist politicians coming to power elsewhere in Europe, a mood of uncertainty has gripped the continent. Europeans look warily across the Atlantic to assess the possible consequences of a Donald Trump presidency, and toward Asia, where the rising power of China has surpassed that of the old continent. We have short memories, of course. The postwar era was not quite the steady ride toward the golden uplands that is now recalled by those who yearn to go back to it.    In the early 1970s, the Western world was facing the economic consequences of an oil price shock that quadrupled the cost of energy and stalled a period of rapid growth. In Europe, Spain and Portugal were still run by anachronistic dictatorships, while a junta of incompetent colonels was in power in Greece. Germany and Italy were threatened by domestic terrorism of the left and right, and even in sedate old Britain a group of superannuated officers and spies plotted a military coup against the Labour government of the day. And, for a further decade and a half, Europe was to remain divided between East and West, living under the threat that a false step or a miscalculation could lead to nuclear war. At the end of the Cold War, the now much-criticized European project led to a period of cooperation and integration between the previously divided halves of the continent. The current received wisdom is that Europe is now facing a widespread revolt by those left behind in this period of rapid change. A populist, nativist sentiment is said to be replacing the liberal internationalism of those who have governed the continent for a generation. It is a theory, of course, that is only as good as the latest election result. Brexit and the failure of Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to gain backing this month for his constitutional reforms appear to affirm the strength of a Europe-wide populist backlash.    But, if the narrow defeat of far-right presidential candidate Norbert Hofer in Austria is followed by election victories for Angela Merkel in Germany and a centrist of the left or right in France next year, the picture might look very different. Whatever the outcome of another year of political uncertainty after the shocks of 2016, Europe\\'s leaders, whoever they turn out to be, will have to face the challenge of changing geopolitics. European strategists believe the relationship with China will be crucial, particularly in view of the antagonistic tone Trump has adopted toward Beijing even before he enters the White House. Sebastien Goulard, a French consultant on China-Europe relations, recently wrote that candidates in France\\'s election next April must pay more attention to links with China. He said the favorite, the center-right\\'s Francois Fillon, had mostly portrayed China as a threat. \"Although he is regarded as a supporter of economic liberalism, Fillon wants Europe to pursue anti-dumping policies toward China,\" Goulard wrote in the Asia-Pacific magazine The Diplomat. \"Furthermore he fails to see China\\'s investments in the innovation sector as an opportunity for France and Europe.\" Meanwhile, Alexander Stubb, a former Finnish prime minister, noted recently that Europe was coming to terms with the fact that China is buying European businesses in all shapes and forms. \"Europe should not complain,\" he wrote in the Financial Times. \"Europe should not burn bridges by taking knee-jerk protectionist measures,\" he wrote. \"Few predicted that the Chinese would emerge as advocates of free trade while the US turned inward.\" These are sentiments that would be widely shared in China. Whether they prevail will depend on the choices made by Europe\\'s increasingly divided electorates. The writer is a senior editorial consultant for China Daily UK.

However, the obesity rate of males aged 7 to 22 in urban areas increased 25-fold from 1985 to 2014, reaching nearly 15 percent, while males in rural areas increased 45-fold. Little spent on public promotion of science China has been gaining international recognition for its scientific research thanks to significant government investment, though authorities seem not as generous in promoting science to the general public. Survey results released on Dec 7 by the Ministry of Science and Technology show that last year, special government funding for science promotion was 4.63 yuan ($0.67; 0.63 euros; 0.53) per capita, a 0.05 yuan drop from the previous year. The fund is mainly spent on sponsoring government organs or semiofficial organs to carry out science promotion projects, such as publishing books, holding lectures and organizing exhibitions. PISA scores for Chinese students fall Chinese students\\' scores fell across the board in science, reading and mathematics, in a global study conducted every three years by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. The so-called PISA test for 2015 found that 15-year-old students\\' scholastic performance weakened, compared with 2012, although they were able to stay in the top 10 in science and math, according to an assessment of results released on Dec 6 by the OECD. Students in Beijing, Jiangsu, Guangdong and Shanghai scored a median 518 and were ranked 10th in science, compared with the 580 score of students from Shanghai in 2012. Industrial park signs Oxford University deal     Jiansu-based Suzhou Industrial Park and the UK\\'s Oxford University signed a deal establishing a joint research center, officials said on Dec 8. The Oxford Suzhou Centre for Advanced Research will be a multi-disciplined research, innovation and technology centre; it will initially focus on biomedical engineering, biomedicine, advanced function material, energy, environmental technology, financial mathematics, computer science and the health industry. The agreement, which took five years to negotiate, was signed by Suzhou Industrial Park\\'s chairman, Yang Zhiping, and Professor Donal Bradley, head of the Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences Division of Oxford University. Small firms should create jobs, Li says Premier Li Keqiang called on the owners of small private businesses to build their brands and contribute to employment and the national economy. At a ceremony on Dec 5 marking the 30th anniversary of the China Privately Owned Business Association, Li met with more than 200 representatives of the group. Such businesses now provide 40 percent of the country\\'s jobs and have played an important role in boosting economic growth, vitalizing the market and meeting the public\\'s diversified demands, Li said. The government will further streamline administrative processes and strengthen public services to protect their rights and legal property, he said. Protection of pandas, big cats to improve China is set to establish a national park system to beef up the protection of giant pandas, Siberian tigers and Amur leopards, according to a decision made by the country\\'s leading group for overall reform. A pilot program for a national park system will help increase the integrity, connectivity and coordination of the habitats of the three at-risk animal species in China, according to a statement released on Dec 5, after a meeting of the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms. New drone adds to PLA\\'s aerial toolbox The People\\'s Liberation Army will soon have a new drone with an unusual shape. It is expected to strengthen the Chinese military\\'s aerial reconnaissance capabilities. An unknown number of Xianglong, or Soar Dragon, high-altitude, long-endurance drones have been produced by Guizhou Aviation Industry Group, which is part of the state-owned aircraft maker Aviation Industry Corp of China, according to aviation sources. The aircraft is believed to be undergoing testing and is expected to be delivered to the PLA soon, sources said, adding that it is likely to become China\\'s answer to the United States\\' Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk, the best-known unmanned surveillance drone in the world. Delivery tricycles get more oversight Beijing recently introduced a registration system for express delivery tricycles that standardizes the appearance of such vehicles. The city also issued safety instruction cards to couriers, officials said. Insurance policies for the tricycles have also become a must for express-delivery companies. About 57,000 tricycles had been repainted as of early December, including those of 40 delivery companies. Some old tricycles do not meet the standards, and companies are being urged to discard them, according to Niu Jianming, office director at the Beijing Express Association. Ancient high-level sacrificial site found Archaeologists recently discovered a government-level venue used by ancient emperors to participate in sacrificial offerings. The Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Archaeology announced the discovery on Dec 5 on its official website, saying the find had great academic value for in-depth research on social institutions and politics of the Qin (221-206 BC) and Western Han (206 BC-AD 24) dynasties, as well as ancient Chinese ritual culture generally. The old sacrificial site, named Yongshan Blood Pool, is located in Fengxiang, about 15 kilometers southeast of the Yongcheng ruins, which is believed to have been the capital of the state of Qin (770-221 BC). Sale of old painting sets price record Five Drunken Kings on Horses, a Chinese classical painting of the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), sold for 303.6 million yuan ($44 million; 41 million euros; 34.6 million) at a Beijing auction on Dec 4, a record high for a Chinese painting so far this year. The color painting drew a packed room of bidders at Beijing Poly Auction\\'s sale of ancient Chinese paintings and calligraphy. The bidding started at 68 million yuan and lasted about 40 minutes. The painting was created by Ren Renfa (1255-1327), a high-ranking official in charge of water conservancy in the Mongol-ruled court. In his spare time, he achieved prominence as a painter of horses and grooms. Xi: Constitution is fundamental President Xi Jinping called for enhanced public awareness of the Constitution and its implementation as the country observed its third National Constitution Day on Dec 4. The Constitution contains the fundamental rules of the nation, and it must be adhered to while implementing the rule of law, Xi said in a message marking the opening of an exhibition hall in Hangzhou. The hall features documents on the first Constitution of the People\\'s Republic of China, which was drafted in Hangzhou and enacted in 1954. China\\'s top legislature adopted the current Constitution on Dec 4, 1982, based on the 1954 version. New hardy rice strain resists cold Yuan Longping, a scientist known as China\\'s \"father of hybrid rice\", has developed a new strain that could enable the plant to adapt to more varied growing environments at a significantly lower cost. The strain, the third generation of hybrid rice that Yuan has developed, is designed to be hardier and able to withstand lower temperatures during the plant\\'s reproductive phase. Yuan said the cost of breeding the new strain has also decreased significantly, making its commercial use viable in the short term. However, he declined to disclose the expected average unit yield of the new rice strain. CFLAC appoints new chairwoman     Writer Tie Ning was elected as chairwoman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, replacing Sun Jiazheng. Tie was also re-elected chairwoman of the Chinese Writers Association. The 10th National Congress of the CFLAC and the Ninth National Congress of the CWA wound up on Dec 3.

       " ['Green bond drives yuan to go global nan China\\'s green bond is becoming a big driver for future renminbi internationalization, effectively linking Western investors\\' strong appetite for investment with green credentials with China\\'s need to channel funds to clean up its environment. As of September, China issued $17.4 billion (16.2 billion euros; 13.8 million) of green bonds, making it the biggest global source of the securities. Green bonds in China have gone from nothing two years ago to accounting for 41 percent of the global market. An example of high profile issue is the New Development Bank\\'s issue of 3 billion yuan ($448.37 million) of yuan-denominated, green bonds in China\\'s interbank market in July. The NDB was established by the BRICS group of emerging nations.   - As of September, China issued $17.4 billion of green bonds, making it the biggest global source of the securities. Provided to China Daily  For the first time this year, green finance also gained a significant place on the agenda of G20 Global Leaders Summit through China\\'s leadership, giving political support for the growth of this market. \"Renminbi green bonds can be attractive to overseas institutional investors because of the extra transparency in the use of proceeds,\" says Sean Kidney, CEO of the non-profit organization Climate Bonds Initiative. Green bonds have more transparency because the money raised needs to be spent on energy and sustainability projects, which is often monitored and certified by third parties. For this reason, European institutional investors looking for long term return, such as pension funds, find green bonds desirable for the safe long term return they generate. \"There is clearly a big demand from European investors for green bonds, supported by political and regulatory push. As things move forward, having green renminbi bonds and therefore a more diversified portfolio will be an attractive opportunity for European investors,\" says Andrew Carmichael, a partner at the law firm Linklaters. Green bonds are not only effective in financing China\\'s domestic sustainable projects, but can also finance infrastructure projects along the Belt and Road initiative. \"Currently there is a huge amount of capital looking for yields, and projects along the Belt and Road strategy are very attractive in providing these desirable yields. \" Kidney adds that the fact that the China-backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has positioned itself as a green bank and said it will prioritize green investments means many of the projects along the Belt and Road will have a green and sustainable focus, and the fact they are likely to be financed in renminbi means investment into those projects by global investors is helpful for the renminbi internationalization process. Despite huge potential, the growth of renminbi green bonds still faces two issues, says Carmichael. \"The first is the depreciation of the renminbi over the past year, creating some reluctance in the market to do renminbi deals, but this should be short-lived. The second issue, which relates to the fact China\\'s own green bond standards are different from Western standards, may take some effort and education to solve,\" he says. Currently Chinese green bonds follow standards set by the Chinese central bank, which are different from global green bond standards in minor ways. For example, funding of clean coal through green bonds in China is allowed, but not internationally. Luckily, harmonization of standards is already happening as an increasing number of bonds issued by Chinese entities fit both the Chinese and international standards. One key example is a $500 million Bank of China bond listed on London Stock Exchange in November. Significantly, this bond is a covered bond, giving investors dual recourse: allowing claims over a dedicated \"cover pool\" of assets, and the usual claim against Bank of China. Carmichael says covered renminbi bonds should be a great opportunity for future renminbi internationalization. \"There is already a big appetite for covered bonds in Europe, so if there is an increase in issuance of renminbi green covered bonds, that will really help renminbi internationalization.\" cecily.liu@mail.chinadailyuk.com (China Daily European Weekly 12/09/2016 page7)'],\n",
       " ['Yuan in demand nan European financial centers seek renminbi business, as Chinese currency gains momentum With the Brexit vote in Britain raising uncertainties about London\\'s leadership in Chinese currency trading, other European financial centers are trying to get a piece of the action. Already the world\\'s third-largest trade finance currency after the US dollar and Euro, the yuan\\'s reserve currency status was boosted by its inclusion in the International Monetary Fund\\'s basket of special drawing rights currencies in October. The inclusion allows the yuan to sit alongside the dollar, euro, pound and yen in a basket that asset managers globally follow for asset allocation. The yuan makes up 10.9 percent of the basket.    To facilitate Western investors\\' increasing yuan asset allocation, the Chinese government also significantly opened up its domestic bond market to foreign access this year and encouraged the issuance of offshore bonds denominated in yuan, also known as dim sum bonds. The Chinese Ministry of Finance issued its first sovereign offshore bond in yuan in London in May, in an effort to boost market confidence by providing liquid and safe bonds against which all other offshore yuan assets can be priced. Miranda Carr, senior analyst at Haitong Securities in London, says the sovereign bond and subsequent offshore renminbi bonds made it easier for international investors to access investment opportunities in Chinese currency. \"Due to the growing prominence of the renminbi globally and its inclusion into the SDR, investors globally are trying to increase their portfolios\\' weight of renminbi assets,\" Carr says.    Jan Dehn, head of research at London-based Ashmore Investment Management, says the increasing issuance of offshore bonds reflects China\\'s decision to open its capital account. \"This decision has enormous significance,\" Dehn says. \"Clearly, an open capital account exposes the country to more foreign exchange volatility, so it is highly advantageous that the renminbi becomes a global reserve currency, since global reserve currencies tend to be more stable than other currencies.\" Dehn added that the issuance of dim sum bonds reflects market demand for yuan, particularly for hedging purposes by corporations. \"Most issuers of overseas RMB tend to be highly solvent institutions that could easily finance in their own currencies or the established global reserve currencies. Hence, they tend to issue in order to meet a specific demand,\" Dehn says. More issuance of RMB bonds abroad also helps to \"populate the offshore renminbi yield curve\", meaning future issuers can more easily find the prices of RMB bonds, Dehn says. In yet another milestone, in April the government of Hungary became the first Eastern European sovereign to issue a dim sum bond. In the first seven months of 2016, 68.3 billion yuan ($9.9 billion; 9.3 billion euros; 7.85 billion) of dim sum bonds were issued. Meanwhile the London Stock Exchange is on track to produce a feasibility study on a link between London and Shanghai stock markets, which over the long term could help Western investors buy A-shares listed in China. Brexit uncertainties Currently, London is the dominant European center for offshore RMB activity. The city overtook Singapore to become the largest yuan clearing center outside China in April, and London\\'s yuan activity has continued to grow despite Brexit uncertainties. The People\\'s Bank of China shows London\\'s yuan-denominated business transactions in August were 60 percent above those in July. Between June 2014, when an official RMB clearing bank was designated, and August 2016, a landmark 10 billion yuan were cleared in London transactions. Brexit - the June referendum in which British citizens voted to leave the European Union - has injected an element of uncertainty. Even so, European financial centers outside of London are competing for RMB activity. Germany\\'s Deutsche Borse made an announcement in October in London that it would establish a D-share market in the second quarter of next year for Chinese companies to raise euro-denominated funds for local acquisitions. Meanwhile Luxembourg Stock Exchange\\'s CEO Robert Scharfe visited China in October to strengthen collaboration with Chinese financial institutions, including Bank of Communications and China Merchants Bank. The Luxembourg exchange currently has the largest listing of offshore RMB bonds in Europe. \"We have witnessed increasing efforts from other European centers to attract offshore renminbi business,\" says Andrew Carmichael, a partner at the law firm Linklaters. He says each European center has its respective strengths. For example, Luxembourg has strength in funds, and Frankfurt is backed by the largest European economy and enjoys proximity to the European Central Bank, Carmichael says. Currency convergence China\\'s journey to internationalize the RMB started after the 2008 financial crisis, when significant quantitative easing by the US government caused China\\'s US dollar-denominated foreign reserves to lose value. Traditionally, because the Chinese government encouraged export-led economic growth, it fixed the renminbi to the US dollar for its exchange rate, which resulted in the accumulation of a large quantity of US dollar foreign reserves. After setting its RMB internationalization agenda, China allowed the renminbi\\'s exchange rate to gradually move toward a managed float coherent with the market equilibrium exchange rate, and encouraged the renminbi\\'s increasing use internationally for trade and investment financing. According to November figures from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, the RMB is the third-most-active currency in trade finance, after the US dollar and euro, with a share of 4.61 percent. SWIFT data also show that 57 countries now use the yuan for more than 10 percent of direct payments to China. Offshore yuan use grew significantly in recent years, but one key development for 2016 is an offshore-onshore convergence facilitated by a growing number of onshore RMB bonds issued. Known as panda bonds, these onshore bonds in China are increasingly sought by global investors as China\\'s domestic bond market liberalizes. Convergence between the onshore and offshore markets is significant in helping the renminbi to move more swiftly across borders, and facilitate liquidity growth in its international use. Sales of panda bonds in the first seven months this year totaled 55.6 billion yuan. Significantly, Poland became the first European country to issue government debt in China\\'s bond market in August. In September, the World Bank issued the first renminbi-settled special drawing rights bonds in China. Panda bonds like the Polish sovereign bond and the World Bank bond will be traded in China\\'s $7 trillion interbank bond market. Despite being the world\\'s third-largest bond market, the foreign investor share there is only 2 percent so far. One key reason is the previous lack of access, but in recent months a significant opening-up has been achieved, and the creation of more international products in this market, like the World Bank bonds, is expected to increase foreign investors\\' interest. Ivan Chung, associate managing director at Moody\\'s, says the simplification in the panda bond issuance procedures is a big driver for more panda bonds and onshore-offshore renminbi market convergence. \"The onshore market has undergone considerable reforms in the area of market liberalization over the past 18 months, integrating it more with international investors and issuers. We are seeing considerable progress in onshore and offshore market convergence this year,\" Chung says. Carr says more international organizations will be issuing and buying RMB denominated bonds in the future, encouraged by the World Bank initiative. But she also warned that in the shorter term there are still challenges for foreign investment in China\\'s bond market, especially unfamiliarity with this new asset class that has only recently opened to international investors. Aside from high-profile financial reforms and RMB financing deals, Chinese shoppers\\' increasing spending in Europe is becoming a significant driver of RMB internationalization, thanks to payment systems like UnionPay and Alipay, which allow Chinese tourists to pay for goods and services in yuan. In 2015, Chinese outbound tourists spent $229 billion overseas, according to research firm GfK. UnionPay already has a network involving 2 million retailers across 39 countries in Europe, where Chinese shoppers can use their Chinese bankcards to pay for shopping, and the card service is rapidly expanding its network. Cui Zhijian, an associate professor of operations management at IE Business School in Spain, says the initiative will facilitate the internationalization of the yuan and will enhance the position of the Chinese financial industry in the world market.

       " ['International yuan boosts Belt and Road nan The next phase of the internationalization of China\\'s currency, the renminbi is progressing rapidly. Market participants are witnessing major steps, such as CIPS, the cross border payment structure, continued expansion of market access programs connecting China and the rest of the world, and the RMB\\'s recent inclusion in the International Monetary Found\\'s special drawing rights basket. That occurred shortly after the first SDR bond issuance by the World Bank in the onshore Interbank Bond Market. There are hundreds of specific projects, the importance and often local relevance of which will evolve over time. Significant trade volumes between China and various European countries, as well as increasing Chinese mergers and acquisitions activity in Europe, contribute to a need for an increased internationalization of the renminbi. RMB Clearing Banks in London, Frankfurt or Luxembourg, and financial institutions such as CEINEX have in Europe, in earlier years, been perceived as steps on the way to the internationalization of the RMB. The Belt and Road Initiative is a Chinese government development framework focused on promoting cooperation and boosting trade through policy coordination, better and more connected infrastructure, lowering or eliminating barriers to trade. From a European perspective, it goes far beyond the ostensible aim of building a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along the ancient Silk Road and maritime routes. The initiative creates corridors for trade and interaction, and overall a conceptual framework beyond infrastructure. As a result, the Belt and Road forms a significant development strategy with the intention of promoting economic cooperation as well as enhancing the orderly free flow of economic factors and the efficient allocation of resources. Trade and investment along the Belt and Road will, in effect, facilitate the overseas use of RMB. The acquisition of Greece\\'s Piraeus Port by Cosco is one example for the interplay between the Chinese and the European economies. Other examples include the New Eurasia Land Bridge (an international railway line running from Lianyungang in China\\'s Jiangsu province to Rotterdam in Holland), an international freight rail route linking Chongqing and Duisburg in Germany; a direct link between Wuhan, Melnik and Pardubice in the Czech Republic, a freight rail route from Chengdu to Lodz in Poland and a freight rail route from Zhengzhou to Hamburg. These new rail routes promote trade by offering \"one declaration, one inspection, one cargo release\". Recent European studies have reviewed how much trade might be created among Belt and Road countries because of the reduction in transportation costs and found that European countries, especially landlocked ones, should benefit considerably. The European Union, originally created as a European Free Trade Zone, was established to ensure peace in Europe by way of promoting free trade among nations. So the Belt and Road Initiative could have a similar, game-changing relevance, as well as an impact on RMB internationalization. RMB\\'s evolving role, both as an international investment currency and as a reserve currency, helps companies working on the Belt and Road projects to get better exchange rates and better financing terms. In this context, the IMF\\'s recent inclusion of RMB in its SDR basket of currencies may form a tipping point in China\\'s role in the world economy. Yet regional economic cooperation is still the most effective way to promote cross-border circulation of RMB. The yuan is now regarded as a very strong and liquid currency in the major Belt and Road regions. In order to facilitate unimpeded trade, various steps will be required to resolve investment and trade issues, reduce investment obstacles and trade barriers as well as lower trade and investment costs. Many Europeans are aware of this and many European countries and institutions want to participate in and benefit from the various projects initiated under the Belt and Road Initiative. In this context it is important to emphasize that the European financial markets may actually support RMB\\'s use in the Belt and Road strategy, as a number of projects may be partly financed outside China - and better interlocked financial Eurasian financial markets may well be one outcome. In Europe it is widely expected that China may enlarge the scope and scale of RMB settlements with countries along the Belt and Road routes, cutting exchange rate risks and transaction costs for trade and investment. The People\\'s Bank of China has signed more than 20 bilateral currency swap agreements with central banks along the Belt and Road routes and China has also designated five RMB clearing banks along the routes - while at the same time other RMB hubs have been established in Luxembourg, London and Frankfurt.

       " [\"Assessing the RMB's multinational role nan When it comes to the clout of its currency, the world's second-largest economy punches significantly below its economic weight Of all the important spheres of economic influence, the international monetary system has been the most rigid in responding to China's unprecedented growth and development. From the absolute level of annual GDP growth and the scale of foreign exchange reserves, to the share of global investment in renewables and other technologies - and countless other metrics - China has risen to occupy the top spot globally. Yet when it comes to the clout of its currency, the world's second-largest economy punches significantly below its economic weight. While the renminbi has gained ground over the past decade, it is still only the fifth-most-used currency in terms of payments, making up just 2 percent of the global total. The picture for reserves is similar. Only 38 countries hold renminbi in their official reserves, with the total value of renminbi holdings equal to $75 billion (70.5 billion euros) - equivalent to just 1.1 percent of total official reserves globally. This discrepancy, far from being accidental, is the result of the cautious attitude of Chinese policy-makers in terms of aligning the country's rapid economic growth with the opening of its capital markets. This approach is now changing. As both a political and an economic tool, the internationalization of the renminbi is becoming a key policy objective. This is reflected in several initiatives, including the creation of new multilateral investment banks such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the New Development Bank, as well as the proliferation of central bank swap agreements. These agreements enable central banks to exchange local currency at fixed rates, ensuring that they can withstand balance of payments pressures when facing market shocks and destabilizing currency fluctuations. This is particularly important for economies that have (or want to build) strong trade and investment links with each other. China is now the largest or second-largest trading partner for most of the world economy.  This creates important incentives for many central banks to hold greater amounts of renminbi in their foreign reserves that can be supplied to domestic banks and to companies that face short-term funding constraints for their foreign currency activities. Since late 2008, 36 central banks have signed currency swap agreements with China, totaling $500 billion. (3.3 trillion yuan). These include central banks in major advanced-economies - the European Central Bank, Bank of England, Bank of Canada, Swiss National Bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Reserve Bank of Australia - but also central banks in emerging economies such as Argentina, Pakistan and Thailand. The renminbi's entry into the International Monetary Fund's special drawing rights currency basket on Oct 1 was an important milestone in consolidating the currency's status as a reserve currency, joining the dollar, euro, pound sterling and yen. Apart from acting as a ceremonial seal of approval, a practical implication of the renminbi's SDR inclusion is to elevate the importance of China's swap agreements. Under existing SDR arrangements central banks that draw renminbi under swap agreements can subsequently convert it into SDR and then into dollars, which means that swap agreements with China now grant these central banks access to international liquidity via an indirect channel. Although such international considerations are important to the growing appeal of the renminbi, the currency's fate crucially remains tied to that of the Chinese economy. While fears over a hard landing have abated compared with the periods of high financial market volatility in mid-2015 and early 2016, China's success in rebalancing its economy, deflating its high debt pile and avoiding the middle-income trap without experiencing a recession, is far from secured. Despite these doubts, the momentum of the renminbi remains strong. Another expansion area in the infrastructure for internationalization is the promotion of the renminbi as a benchmark currency for commodities. This includes an already launched renminbi-denominated benchmark price for gold. Oil could follow next, as China seeks to avoid exchange rate risks and to hedge against shocks in oil-exporting regions, which in turn would see increased incentives for raising their renminbi holdings. This multitude of initiatives to actively promote the internationalization of the currency, together with the growing foreign acceptance and interest in the renminbi as reflected in its SDR inclusion, sets the scene for a new era in Chinese policy-making where the rise of the renminbi will be one of the principal, if not the most important, characteristics in a phase of rebalancing and transition. In turn, China's growing monetary influence will with time come to challenge the dollar's hegemony, consolidating a new era in the global monetary landscape, that of the multicurrency system.

       " ['China is nutty about Potter nan Enthusiasm unabated in China nearly 20 years after the schoolboy wizard first cast his spell on the world Late at night in Beijing on Nov 24, as the temperature continued to fall to its forecast -5 C, and as the usual din in the streets of the city\\'s Sanlitun area began to abate, an unusual scene began to unfold. Every now and then, strange figures in twos and threes strolled into the square, in the middle of which was a giant brown suitcase in front of a billboard for the movie Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Almost all these people wore black gowns, striped scarves of scarlet - and gold, green, silver, yellow, black, blue and bronze - and ties in the same matching patterns. Some wore carrot-shaped earrings, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows necklaces, or silver badges saying \"Head Boy\" or \"Head Girl\". Tucked inside their bulky sleeves and bags were exquisite wands. The square was abuzz with their chatter, and they eventually headed for the warmer confines of an underground cinema, the Megabox, where they lined up to get preordered tickets for Fantastic Beasts from a group that calls itself the Room of Requirement. The film premiered on the Chinese mainland after midnight.  - Harry Potter fans gathered in Beijing to watch the movie Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Photos Provided to China Daily  - Lin Pin, a cosplayer and PhD student at Peking University.  - Harry Potter fans help each other adjust their fittings.  - Fellow Harry Potter cosplayers at a wedding of one of their members in November 2015.     Once they had secured their tickets, these die-hard Harry Potter fans chatted with one another and took photos. A total of 102 fans from all walks of life attended the premiere that night. Some traveled from Tianjin especially for the party. It was the third activity this year organized by the Room of Requirement, a society named after the room in the Harry Potter novels. It was started in February, when fans from all over China gathered in Shanghai for a memorial event for Alan Rickman, the British actor who played Professor Snape, and who died in January. \"It\\'s amazing to make so many friends who love Harry Potter books,\" says Zhang Ruoxi, 26, one of the organizers of the activity. \"It feels like a lot of witches and wizards hide among ordinary people, and when you raise your wand they will respond to you.\" Zhang is an engineer. Other Potter fans included an architect, a doctor, an editor, a student and a traffic police officer.  \"When you put on the gown, no matter who you are or what you do, you are just one of us, equal and being cared for and loved as a Harry Potter fan,\" says Liu Zhujie, 18, another organizer of the activity. Liu, from Shanghai, recently started university studies in Beijing. It is difficult to say how many Harry Potter fans there are in China, but since 2000, when the Chinese version of the first book came out, nearly 20 million copies of the series have been sold. When the last book of the series Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was published nine years ago, there were 1 million copies in the first print run of the Chinese version. The Chinese version of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was published on Oct 29, and since then all 300,000 copies have been sold and the publisher is printing more. British author J.K. Rowling\\'s Potter novels have played a significant role in the lives of many Chinese readers, especially those of the only-child generations. Not only did they grow up with Harry, Ron and Hermione, but they have also formed great friendships as a result of a shared enthusiasm. One of the most outlandish things that Lin Pin, now 28, has done relating to Harry Potter was in 2003 when he started high school in Fujian province. Lin had special feelings for Harry Potter because when he was attending middle school a close family member died, reflecting the experience of the fictional British schoolboy Harry, both of whose parents died when he was an infant. \"Rowling\\'s stories gave me very important comfort and accompanied me as I went through pain and sadness,\" Lin says. In the summer of 2003, Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix was published. To read the story as early as possible, Lin went online for the first time in his life to buy his first English novel, and he devoured it no time. In the book, his favorite adult character Sirius Black, Harry\\'s godfather, dies. Lin was so saddened by this that he wrote a poem in memory of him. At high school, Lin took part in a poetry recital contest. All the other students chose well-known classic poems, but Lin recited the poem he wrote for Sirius Black. Not only that, but he bought a gown online and was dressed like Harry Potter when he was stepped onto the stage.  \"It was the first time that I cosplayed Harry,\" Lin says. \"It was also the first time that anyone had done cosplay in our county.\" Lin says the sincerity in his poem touched many in the audience, whether they had read the books or not. But his antics were regarded as offbeat, particularly because many teachers and students at the time knew nothing of the stories, let alone the fictional character Sirius Black. \"For me, it is a very precious memory. Although the character is fictional, I expressed sincere feelings in my poem that touched many in the audience,\" he says. Later, he often cosplayed Harry Potter with other fans, especially after he went to Beijing. Some say he is the person in China who looks most like Harry Potter. Lin is now a PhD student at Peking University and will graduate next year. As a student in the Chinese Department he wrote a paper on Harry Potter when he was a junior undergraduate. In nearly 40,000 characters he analyzed the reasons for the popularity of the novels worldwide, rejecting the view of many critics that Harry Potter books are children\\'s books that are either too naive for adults or too dark for children. He dug out the deeper meaning behind the metaphor of the magic world Rowling had created. Lin says her books have helped form his worldview. With characters like crazy girl Luna and the twins Fred and George, the books have encouraged him to be himself regardless of what other people think, he says. \"Luna is my favorite character in the novels. She shows us there are so many different kinds of people in the world. We should respect people who are different from us, embrace diversity and treat others fairly.\" That worldview and ethos is shared by many Harry Potter aficionados, among them Yin Pingping, 29. \"After I finished reading The Casual Vacancy I was very much touched by Rowling\\'s humanist spirit,\" she says. \"She is so consistently sincere with herself and readers. In the Harry Potter series she writes about discrimination against non-pureblooded witches and wizards, and the slavery of house elves. She expresses her opposition to racism, sexism and hierarchy through the stories in the magic world. And in The Casual Vacancy she expresses such ideas more directly.\" Like many Harry Potter fans, Yin was immediately drawn into Rowling\\'s magic world once she started reading the first book in the series.  In 2003, when cases of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) were reported in Beijing, Yin was a high school student in the capital. Because of SARS schools were closed, so Yin spent six months studying at home and communicating with schoolmates on the school\\'s bulletin board system. \"We built a section especially devoted to Harry Potter and made a lot of friends,\" she says. Three years later when she arrived at Fudan University in Shanghai, she felt lonely because many of her schoolmates in the city had known each other since primary school. At the suggestion of a roommate, Yin printed some advertising fliers in an effort to gather Harry Potter fans, but without success. So she knocked on dormitory doors, one after another, looking for \"comrades\" in different classes. Finally she recruited about 30 first-year students, a number that narrowly passed the requirement of the university to set up a new club. Despite some skepticism, the university eventually granted Yin\\'s application and she became the leader of the Harry Potter Fan Society at Fudan University, the first in China. To better organize activities for members, she had to give up training with the women\\'s softball team at the university and the Japanese course she had planned to take. Before the last Harry Potter book came out in 2007, the society had more than 400 members. Regular activities included the annual performance of a play adapted from the novels - or an original play - in November, a reading club each week and a costume ball on Halloween. \"Unlike many other societies, we gathered together because we love the books rather than to build up relationships for our future, as many students do at university,\" Yin says. \"So I am glad that our society kept a space for people like us. And it also showed how tolerant the school was. We received a lot of interviews, including some by foreign media.\" The society gave Yin many things, including a romantic relationship. But what she cherished above all, she says, was the spirit she got from the books of Harry Potter: courage, responsibility, love and friendship. \"I started reading Harry Potter when I was 11 years old. At the most important moments of my life, when I was disappointed in love, failed in examination, or couldn\\'t find a job, I would always go back to the books, where all the questions have solutions.\" Lin\\'s feelings are similar. \"I read Harry Potter stories from the spring of 2001 to the summer of 2007, between the ages - 12 and 18, while characters in the books Harry, Hermione, Ron and Luna - grew up from 11 to 17. In my youth their company was irreplaceable.\" So irreplaceable that some diehard fans have used Harry Potter as the theme for their weddings, with Harry Potter books or stuffed owls as decorations, and borrowing from the book for their marriage vows. Lin analyzes the popularity of the Harry Potter series from another perspective, saying: \"It\\'s very precious because many die-hard fans, including me, are the only child of our families, without brothers or sisters.\" \"But we have made many friends because of this common interest. We communicate both online and offline, transcending the limit of space or the connection of blood.\" The Room of Requirement is a good example. Zhang and Liu have made more than 270 friends online. \"When you go traveling, just put on your gown and you will be received by friends in every city,\" Zhang says. \"When I decided which university I wanted to go to in June, I found the gate of the world was open wide to me. Instead of remaining in Shanghai and spending my whole life there, I decided to come to Beijing. And when I arrived I didn\\'t feel lonely at all, because I knew there was a group of people like me living here.\" yangyang@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/09/2016 page1)'],\n",

On Nov 30, the company launched its map services for more countries and regions. The services will cover countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, North America, South America and Oceania, and provide services for 99 percent of the world population. \"This signals that we will finally transform from a Chinese map provider to a world map provider and become the Chinese brand that provides global services for mobile travel applications,\" says Li Dongmin, general manager of Baidu Map. Currently, Baidu Map claims to account for about 70 percent of domestic market share, with more than 300 million active monthly users and about 100 million car owners using its mapping service. At the beginning of the year, Baidu Map initiated its internationalization strategies and has been expanding rapidly around the globe. On Nov 28, Baidu Map started strategic cooperation with the tourist administrations of four northern European countries - Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. The two sides will exchange data, share resources, and jointly develop more events to improve the travel experiences of Chinese visitors.    \"The cooperation signals a further step forward in the localization of Baidu Map in the course of its internationalization, following our cooperation with the tourist administrations of South Korea and Thailand,\" Li says. In the first half of 2016, Chinese people made 59.03 million trips abroad, up 4.3 percent year-on-year, according to the China National Tourism Administration. Baidu Map says it has covered 25 percent of Chinese outbound tourists and, by 2020, it aims to have overseas users accounting for half of its total users. \"We will strengthen in-depth cooperation with overseas governments and leading enterprises and choose some key countries to provide mapping services in local languages and increase our local impact,\" Li says. zhuwenqian@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/02/2016 page26)'],\n",
       " ['Rent-a-bike: High hopes for emerging sector nan In the 1980s, a bicycle, a radio and a sewing machine were considered the top three necessities for young Chinese couples contemplating marriage. At the time, China was the \"Kingdom of Bicycles\" - bikes were key to people\\'s daily transportation. Now, the country boasts the world\\'s largest automobile market. There are more cars than bicycles on the roads. Yet, ambitious entrepreneurs keep attempting to restore the lost glory of bikes. Their strategy, however, is changing.   - A student uses an ofo bike on the campus of the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. Zhu Xingxin / China Daily  While continuing to advice every family to own at least one bike, they are also attempting to persuade people to share bikes. Welcome to bike-on-demand services, the latest segment in China\\'s booming sharing economy. They are not very different from ride-on-demand apps, which changed the way people hail cabs in China. Sensing potential for a similar success story, venture capital firms are betting big on bike-on-demand apps. Since August, two Beijing-based startups - Mobike, which enables people to rent the nearest available GPS-enabled bike via smartphones, and its rival ofo - have been locked in a race for funding. New investors have poured cash into them every two weeks on average. Newcomers such as Hello-bike and Ubike are emerging. However, catching up with Mobike and ofo, which also make bikes, may prove easier said than done. Mobike\\'s two kinds of signature black-and-orange bikes are already ubiquitous in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Chengdu. Ofo\\'s shiny yellow bikes are gaining visibility on university campuses in 18 cities, and all over Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou. Mobike has so far deployed around 100,000 bikes across the five cities. There are more than 190,000 ofo bikes out there. Each of its bikes costs Mobike hundreds to around 2,000 yuan ($290; 273 euros; 231); for ofo, a bike costs between 200 yuan and 300 yuan, depending on bells and whistles like a vegetable basket in front. Hu Weiwei, the founder of Mobike, says there is a certain rationale to the investment spree in bike-sharing firms. \"People have always had a need for bikes, to cover short distances of less than 5 kilometers. With the development of mobile internet technology, we can now make it happen.\" While cab-on-demand services such as Didi Chuxing meet people\\'s demand for quick long-distance rides, bike-sharing firms serve urban citizens seeking to reach a bus stop from home, an office from a subway station or a neighborhood vegetable market from their apartment. Li Xiangyu, 20, a student at Beijing-based University of International Business and Economics, says he instantly took a shine to Mobike after trying out the 1/2-yuan-per-hour service. \"I ride their bike every time I need to go from the university to the nearest subway station. Unlike the bike-rental services that require users to borrow bikes from (and return them to) certain locations, services like Mobike allow users to borrow and return bikes wherever and whenever they want,\" says Li. Because Mobike\\'s bicycles are GPS-enabled, the next borrower will be able to find them using his/her smartphone. In Mobike\\'s case, after users locate the nearest available bike, they can reach it and book it by scanning its ID or QR code. Payments are done online using apps such as WeChat and Alipay. There is no time limit for a ride. Li Hao, an analyst at Beijing-based internet consultancy Analysys, says: \"There will be many bumps ahead, such as how to lower the cost of the high-tech bikes and how to cooperate with local governments.\" Contact the writers at mengjing@chinadaily.com.cn and ouyangshijia@chinadaily.com.cn  (China Daily European Weekly 12/02/2016 page25)'],\n",
       " ['Meet the real-life robocop nan Mechanical workers are playing an ever-increasing role in Chinese life Security officer AnBot, on patrol at the Shenzhen Bao\\'an International Airport, stands out from the other security officers at the scene. They are tall - and cool. In contrast, AnBot is just 1.5 meters high, portly and oval-shaped. But it\\'s AnBot that attracts the attention of passers-by. AnBot is no ordinary security officer. It is China\\'s first \"robotcop\" and came into service in August. The smart machine can move on wheels at speeds of up to of 18 kilometers per hour. Equipped with four cameras, it can automatically map the best routes for itself to move, communicate with people and recognize and track faces. When its battery is about to die, it can find the nearest charging point, enabling it to patrol nonstop for eight hours.       More important, in an emergency situation, human officers can guide the robot by remote control to disable or disarm a target. According to the Shenzhen Municipal Public Security Bureau, AnBot can patrol 24 hours a day and is of great help at the short-staffed airport. The smart machine, developed by China\\'s top military academy, the National University of Defense Technology, is part of the country\\'s effort to develop service robots for both professional and personal use, amid the dual challenges of an aging society and rising labor costs. \"Though China became the biggest market for industrial robots as early as 2013, its service robot industry is still at a very early stage,\" says Luo Jun, CEO of the Asian Manufacturing Association. In 2014, 212,590 service robots were sold in China, accounting for less than 5 percent of the global market, according to the Shenzhen-based Forward Business Research Institute. But that is changing rapidly, partly fueled by strong policy support from national and provincial governments, and rising demand from China\\'s swelling middle class. In April, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology unveiled an ambitious plan to sell more than 30 billion yuan ($4.4 billion; 4.1 billion euros; 3.5 billion)-worth of domestic service robots by 2020 to meet demand from the healthcare, education, entertainment, medical and defense industries. \"If you ask me to describe the development of China\\'s robotics industry in one word, I\\'d choose \\'explosion\\',\" says Zhao Jie, a professor of mechanical engineering at Harbin Institute of Technology. According to Zhao, investment and talent are flooding into the industry, with the involvement of giants as well as startups. In line with the trend, the institute\\'s startup HIT Robot Group was launched in 2014, in partnership with the Heilongjiang provincial government. The university has done years of cutting-edge robot research. It is the maker of China\\'s first space robots and lunar vehicle. One of its priorities now is to develop service robots for professional use, such as defense robots. Some of its anti-terrorism robots, which can sniff out bombs, climb slopes, monitor the environment and operate guns, have been exported to countries in the southern hemisphere already, an employee at HIT Robot says. \"Universities and enterprises are working closely on the research and development of robotics technology, which is pushing China\\'s service robot industry forward,\" says Hao Yucheng, deputy director of the China Robot Industry Alliance. According to Hao, the professional robot industry is investment-intensive, highly risky and generates slow returns. Any breakthrough demands long-term effort. Shortsighted strategies will lead to failure, he says. Zhejiang University, in association with Nanjiang Robotics, a startup that was created in 2014, unveiled Chitu - China\\'s first four-legged robot, that can jump and run - at the recent Third World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province. The mid sized, spider like Chitu can walk upstairs step-by-step, just like human beings, and can carry a load of up to 50 kg. \"In the future, Chitu could be used to carry goods in earthquake-stricken areas and outdoors where the roads are pretty bumpy,\" says Li Chao, a member of the research team from Zhejiang University. A vacuum cleaner robot outsold TVs to emerge as the top-selling electronic appliance on Alibaba\\'s Tmall.com on Nov 11, China\\'s annual Singles Day online shopping festival. Online sales of DeeBot, the vacuum cleaner developed by Ecovacs Robotics Co, generated 200 million yuan. Such an encouraging consumer response is pulling new players into the industry. Xiaomi Corp, which has evolved from a smartphone maker to a tech giant, unveiled an automated vacuum cleaner in September. This explosion of service robots is spawning unlikely uses beyond households, in places like cemeteries. In central Henan province, a cemetery deployed a humanoid robot in October to escort female patrol guards on night duty, local media reported. Winnie Tang, a founding member of the Hong Kong Professionals and Senior Executives Association, an organization to promote communication between the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong, says in a column for the South China Morning Post that there are three stages in the evolution of the service robots in China: tool, governor and companion. \"China is still at the \\'tool\\' stage, where robots are mainly used to do household chores. To progress, the country must enter the \\'governor\\' and \\'companion\\' stages, where the main objective is social interaction,\" she says. masi@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/02/2016 page28)'],\n",

The newly separated pipeline company will be responsible for all pipeline-related operations, while the corporation will establish five individual natural gas sales companies. The pipeline unit of the major oil and natural gas provider was previously responsible for both natural gas pipeline operations and sales.   - Workers replace a pressure meter on a section of natural gas pipeline in the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai province. Xinhua  Xu Wenrong, vice-president of CNPC, says the move is significant in accelerating market reform in the natural gas sector. An analyst also says the spinoff of the natural gas pipeline operations and sales business will move the company in the direction of a more subdivided natural gas sales organization and let the market play a decisive role in resource allocation. According to Sun Yang, an analyst from Zhongyu Counsel, a counseling agency in the fields of coal, steel, oil and natural gas, the separation of natural gas sales and pipeline units will help speed up market reform in the natural gas sector and help formulate market-oriented prices for clean energy. The company recently raised non-residential natural gas prices in the country\\'s northern regions to help manage peak demand during a winter expected to be the coldest in four years. It raised prices by 10 percent in Shandong province, and gas prices were also increased in the northeast to deal with a \"very tight supply\" in the peak winter period. The state-owned company said earlier that it would increase investment in natural gas pipeline construction and gas sales in the coming decade. The company, Asia\\'s biggest oil and gas producer, currently allocates 70 percent of its total budget to natural gas production and around 10 percent to gas pipeline construction. It is expected to increase these figures as it focuses more effort on its gas business, says Hou Qijun, head of CNPC\\'s planning department. Hou says the firm will expand its annual gas output to 180 billion cubic meters by 2020 from the current capacity of 120 billion cu m. PetroChina Co, CNPC\\'s listed arm, says its profits from natural gas and pipelines slumped nearly 36 percent to 4.7 billion yuan ($703 million; 663.2 million euros; 561.6) in the first four months of 2016. The 2050 energy outlook report, released by CNPC\\'s research institute, shows that China\\'s natural gas use will surge to 510 billion cu m by 2030 and 710 billion cu m by 2050. zhengxin@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/02/2016 page25)'],\n",

The 2,197-meter bridge will link Nizhneleninskoye in the Russian Jewish region with Tongjiang, Heilongjiang province, at an estimated cost of nearly $230 million (216 million euros; 183 million), according to Gurevich. The bridge was designed by Russia\\'s Giprostroymost Institute, meeting both Russian and Chinese standards. It will have both a standard gauge (1,435 mm) track and a Russian gauge (1,520 mm) track, with the two tracks offset by 800 mm, so that only one can be used at a time. Coordination of the Belt and Road Initiative with the Eurasian Economic Union is promising and historic, experts say. The Silk Road Economic Belt was initiated by President Xi Jinping in 2013, first in Kazakhstan, which is a key member of the Eurasian Economic Union, and he paid a state visit to Uzbekistan in June, on the path of the ancient Silk Road. Shakhrat Nuryshev, Kazakhstan\\'s ambassador to China, said China was the first country, in 1992, to recognize the independence of Kazakhstan and to establish diplomatic relations with the former Soviet republic. Nuryshev says the Belt and Road Initiative, Shanghai Cooperation Organization and EEU can be more connected and provide a clear direction for multinational cooperation.    Kerry Brown, of the China Studies Center at Sydney University in Australia, says China would like to provide opportunities for EEU countries, especially those that are involved in the Silk Road Economic Belt, with long-term, low-interest loans similar to those given in Africa for big infrastructure projects. Kamel Mellahi, professor of strategic management at Warwick Business School in the United Kingdom, says: \"Regional connectivity is the main objective of the strategy of China\\'s Silk Road. There is little doubt that it\\'s a win-win project for all countries involved.\" Yang Cheng, deputy director of the Center for Russian Studies at East China Normal University in Shanghai, says most EEU countries have resource-based economies whose energy sectors suffered from the rapid downturn in oil prices - even though the lower prices brought opportunities for cooperation with China in other sectors. Yang says the coordination of initiatives provides opportunities for countries that want to raise their competitiveness in international markets. Such coordination could result in constructive reforms of their resource-based economies and also see China and EEU countries build an efficient industry chain, allowing greater capital input. He says that to coordinate the two initiatives, \"all countries need to establish greater industrial cooperation - and not only industrial cooperation but capital, talent, technology, market and cultural cooperation\". renqi@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/02/2016 page30)'],\n",

The fund is a $10 billion (9.4 billion euros; 8 billion) pool established by the Russian government in June 2011 to make equity investments in high-growth sectors of the Russian economy. Both the Russian and Chinese governments are pushing coordination of the Eurasian Economic Union with China\\'s Belt and Road Initiative. Dmitriev says the support from leaders stimulates business development by minimizing additional risk and reducing red tape around Sino-Russian economic cooperation.    \"If our leaders continue to inspire and promote this cooperation, governments and companies will follow suit,\" Dmitriev says. \"However, to achieve this we need specially designed vehicles, such as the Russia-China Investment Fund and the Russia-China Intergovernmental Investment Cooperation Commission and the Russia-China Business Advisory Committee, to be successful in converting the positive and proactive attitudes of our leaders into real and trangible mutual benefit for both the Russian and Chinese economies.\" The Russian fund, together with China Investment Corporation, established the Russia-China Investment Fund, or RCIF, in 2012, which received $2 billion in commitments from the Russian Direct Investment Fund and China Investment Corp. Dmitriev says the RCIF has identified five key focus areas in which lie considerable potential for generating returns that include natural resources, infrastructure, food and agriculture, and consumer goods and services. \"We target opportunities created by the rapid development of economic cooperation, fast-growing trade and the increasing purchasing power of the middle class in Russia and China,\" Dmitriev says. \"The approach allows the fund to generate attractive returns for investors.\" He adds that RCIF projects in China include investments in Didi Dache, Tutor Group and the Russian-China Bridge across the Amur River. Just recently, RCIF and Tus-Holdings, an integrated enterprise that owns Tsinghua University Science Park, agreed to establish a joint Russia-China Venture Fund. The fund will promote the development of trade and economic investment, as well as scientific and technological cooperation between Russia and China. \"The fund target size will be up to $100 million and may be further increased,\" he says. \"The RCIF and Tus-Holdings will be anchor investors. There will likely also be participation from other Russian and Chinese institutional investors.\" \"The One Belt, One Road Initiative is very important for Russia, because it has the potential to provide sources of additional economic growth,\" Dmitriev says. \"Russia\\'s strategic location between China and Europe means we are ideally situated to support this initiative and improve the connectivity between East and West.\" At present, the Russian Direct Investment Fund is actively looking for more Belt and Road-related investment opportunities and has signed a partnership agreement with the Silk Road Fund of China, a state-owned investment fund of the Chinese government, to foster increased investment in countries along the Belt and Road route and is actively pursuing related investment opportunities. Dmitriev says the railroad bridge across the Amur may serve as and example of a potential Belt and Road connection with the EEU. The bridge - called the Amur International Rail Bridge or the China-Russian Tongjiang Rail Bridge - links Nizhneleninskoye with Tongjiang. Dmitriev says the bridge will be greatly beneficial to both countries as it creates a new export corridor and alleviates transport infrastructure constraints between new fields being developed in Eastern Siberia and the Far East. It will also allow for a significant increase in the turnover of goods and the competitiveness of Russian exporters and producers when entering Chinese markets. renqi@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/02/2016 page30)'],\n",
       " ['Shanghai increases down payment requirements nan Shanghai\\'s housing authorities have announced that they are stepping up limitations on home purchases in the city. In particular, they are raising down payment requirements as part of an effort to restrain fast-rising house prices by limiting speculative buying. Analysts say that more measures could be taken since policy-makers have not exhausted the many tools they have in the box. In the process, the city\\'s housing market may see fluctuations in both trading activities and average prices, they say.   - Buyers select apartments at a real estate fair in Shanghai. Provided to China Daily  The new measure, announced Nov 28, says that the required down payment for first-home buyers is raised to no less than 35 percent of the total price, compared to the previous requirement of no less than 30 percent. The definition of first-home buyer has also been narrowed to those who do not own a home and also have no record of a housing loan from any bank nationwide. Previously, the definition looked only at housing loans from banks in the city. Homebuyers who have previously applied for a home loan and have cleared their debt are not defined as first-home buyers, according to the new measure. Other buyers are required to pay at least 50 percent as a down payment, and buyers of nonstandard apartments, such as villas and luxury apartments, are required to pay at least 70 percent down, according to the new measure. \"The move totally rules out speculative buyers in the housing market in Shanghai, giving no chance for them to leverage home loans to buy more apartments than they actually need,\" says Feng Shuguang, a realty agent at Shanghai Dongyun Real Estate. These policies could have a significant impact on transaction volumes as many recent deals have been households upgrading properties, with many of these purchasers taking advantage of the 30 percent to 40 percent down payment requirements. The implementation of the new measures means many of these purchasers may no longer have the requisite capital for the increased down payments of 50 to 70 percent, says James Macdonald, head of Savills China Research. \"While this is unlikely to have an immediate impact on pricing, reduced transaction volumes will most likely cool price growth further. Additionally, if transaction volumes remain low for a sustained period of time, this will result in an increase in downward pressure on pricing,\" says Macdonald. Since the beginning of 2016, Shanghai has launched a slew of measures to cool its overheated residential market. wuyiyao@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/02/2016 page26)'],\n",
       " ['Electric bus pioneer pulls into wider European market nan As environmental regulations tighten, manufacturer is well placed to meet growing demand Chinese vehicle manufacturer BYD is playing a major role in meeting Europe\\'s demand for environmentally friendly transport. The company is competing with Western producers such as Volkswagen, Renault-Nissan, and General Motors for a slice of the growing market for electric vehicles. As the producer of Europe\\'s largest fleet of all-electric buses, BYD recently announced it was setting up a new factory in Hungary to produce electric vehicles in preparation for even faster expansion.  - BYD\\'s electric single-deck buses on display in London. Photos Provided to China Daily  The assembly plant in the northern Hungarian city of Komarom, to be built with 20 million euros ($21.3 million; 17 million) of investment, will employ up to 300 people over two shifts and will be capable of assembling up to 400 vehicles a year. With a research and development center and battery-testing facility, it will begin production in the first quarter of 2017. \"There is literally no limit to our ambitions in the UK and Europe,\" says Isbrand Ho, managing director of BYD Europe. \"We plan to roll out more business-to-business products and then will come our passenger cars.\" BYD started selling buses to the UK three years ago, initially as a trial run. After proving its technology, it rolled out 51 all-electric versions of the iconic London red bus in September, to operate between London Bridge and Waterloo. That is so far Europe\\'s largest pure electric bus fleet, and it is estimated that it will reduce London\\'s CO2 emissions by 700 metric tons a year.  In addition to the London buses, BYD has supplied fleets to Merseyside and Nottingham. It sold 50 taxis to British company Thriev two years ago and is now partnering with the popular taxi hailing app Uber for a trial of 30 electric taxis. Although it\\'s a newcomer to the UK, BYD has made a big name for itself in a market where its competitors have supplied only 22 electric buses to London. The market potential is huge because the Greater London Authority aims to make all 300 of the city\\'s single-deck buses that travel through central London zero-emission by 2020, and all its 3,100 double-deckers by 2019. BYD\\'s electric buses in the UK are made in partnership with Scottish company Alexander Dennis. BYD supplies the chassis, which holds the core technology and powertrain, and Alexander Dennis manufactures the body, which includes innovative features such as USB charging points and Wi-Fi. To service the new buses, 43 charging points were supplied by BYD and installed at the Waterloo garage, with another five located at the nearby Mandela Way depot. BYD worked closely with Scotland\\'s SSE energy group and UK Power Networks on providing power. About 7 million passengers a year use buses on the routes, covering more than 1.1 million kilometers to April 2016. BYD has also supplied vehicles to other countries, including Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium and Spain. The company has already produced 10,000 buses, which are sold across 50 countries and operate in 240 cities. BYD was founded in Shenzhen in 1995. It\\'s European headquarters is in the Netherlands. Originally a battery maker, it became the world\\'s largest rechargeable battery manufacturing firm. Battery technology remains its core competitive advantage for electric vehicles. \"We understand batteries better than anyone else,\" Ho says.  This technology gave BYD a big head start when it started to make electric vehicles. Unlike competitors, who buy batteries from third parties, BYD can use its in-house iron phosphate battery, which is known to be safe, reliable and long-lasting. \"Every competitor has to acquire this technology from third parties and try and integrate the related components, while we produce all these in-house,\" Ho says. With a team of 16,000 research and development engineers, BYD has ambitions to increase the power density of its batteries by 10 percent per year. \"This means more powerful batteries offering even longer range, or lighter, smaller batteries offering more carrying capacity for people and goods,\" he says. Perhaps as testimony to its battery technology, BYD\\'s buses in London have proved that they can run reliably and consistently for a 16-hour shift without charging. BYD\\'s strategic position as an electric vehicle maker has come at an opportune time, because over the next few years global emission standards will become increasingly strict. In BYD\\'s home market the government has announced big plans to encourage electric vehicle growth. By spring this year, BYD was producing more than 10,000 electric buses worldwide. With the Chinese government\\'s goal of having 5 million all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids on the roads by 2020, China\\'s electric vehicle market has boomed. Sales of electric and hybrid vehicles reached 206,000 for the first eight months of 2016, a 160 percent increase from 2015, according to JATO Dynamics, a research firm. Globally, 1.79 million electric and hybrid vehicles were sold the same year, JATO says. With such huge opportunities, it is a competitive market. Chinese carmaker Zhejiang Geely is building electric taxis, known as TX4 Euro 5 London taxicabs, after its acquisition of the London Taxi Co three years ago. They will be launched in mid-2017 and, which shifting from diesel to electric power, will also be more spacious. Chang\\'an Automobile and SAIC Motors are also selling electric and hybrid vehicles in response to Chinese policy initiatives to support the sector. Felipe Munoz, global automotive analyst at JATO, says BYD\\'s position as the leading Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer gives it on edge over Western competitors. \"China wants to lead global markets with electric vehicles. To be local to China is its major advantage because it will be part of the accelerated growth that will bring more technologies and expertise,\" Munoz says. Munoz says BYD\\'s presence in Europe means it can benefit from various European laws and government incentives. To encourage the increased use of electric cars, European regulators have set a goal of turning 10 percent of parking spaces in new buildings in the eurozone into recharging points. Norway and the Netherlands, two countries leading electric vehicle growth in Europe, have plans to completely phase out diesel vehicles by 2025.  Munoz says BYD\\'s main challenge in Europe is gaining recognition and combating the bad reputation Chinese cars have there. \"The European market is very competitive, with very little space for newcomers, as the local players are very well positioned in their markets,\" he says. \"All electric vehicles face problems trying to gain the trust of consumers, who worry about their range, recharging and efficiency issues. And this is even more of a problem if the brand is unknown to most of the public.\" In this respect, perhaps BYD\\'s strategy of establishing a name in the public transport sector before rolling out cars is smart. Looking into the future, Ho is optimistic about growth in the use of electric vehicles in Europe, because cities are becoming increasingly densely populated, creating a big demand for public transport. And the environmental credentials of electric vehicles are a big factor, as European cities move increasingly to reduce pollution, he says. cecily.liu@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/02/2016 page29)'],\n",

Miao Wei, minister of industry and information technology, says these platforms will change production and management. They will be able to attract both small and micro businesses as well as big companies. \"It allows employees within the company to get rewards in addition to their salary by sharing creative ideas online. It will also offer opportunities to manufacturers outside the company to take part in innovation and share the benefits,\" he says.   - An advertisement in the Zhongguancun incubation area, which offers startup companies breakfast to see other companies\\' roadshows. A Jing / For China Daily  The \"Made in China 2025\" initiative is a 10-year national plan designed to transform China from a manufacturing giant into a global high-tech manufacturing power. Robots and high-end numerically controlled machine tools are among the 10 key fields of the initiative. With more capital and technology supporting models, the minister says, a large group of micro businesses will be incubated, and cooperation among research institutions through internet technologies will upgrade their innovations in a more efficient manner, in particular in industries such as e-commerce, telecommunication and other types of service businesses. Eager to upgrade the country\\'s manufacturing ability, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology launched 46 intelligent manufacturing pilot projects in 2015 and started 63 projects in industries such as bullet trains, 3D printing, construction machinery and electric vehicles.    The Central government has allocate 5.2 billion yuan ($755 million; 710 million euros; 605 million) to promote 133 key projects in 25 provinces and autonomous regions involving intelligent manufacturing this year, which is nearly 1.5 times the capital invested in the projects in 2015. \"China is experiencing a new type of industrialization, IT application, urbanization and agricultural modernization, which can generate strong domestic demand,\" Miao says.

Please push the \\'open\\' button to receive your present.\" That was the human-like voice of a robot - waist-high, cylindrical, mobile, wearing a bow tie and behaving gentlemanly - speaking to Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, on his recent visit to China. The robot gave the prince a notebook with an embroidered cover and the royal visitor appeared pleased with both the gift and his new Chinese friend who, avoiding the crowds and obstacles, guided him through the hall to the exhibition stand. Designed by Yunji Technology, a Chinese startup, Run is the latest in a series of robots that have been impressing VIPs. Pitt, Run\\'s predecessor, had interacted with Premier Li Keqiang and then became an online celebrity. Yunji has multiple patents for artificial intelligence in China. The company focuses on the development and commercialization of autonomous robots, especially for delivering goods. Zhi Tao, co-founder and CEO of Yunji, says he believes the key is to make every robot move freely. \"In order to bring robots to the masses, it is important to make them move easily. Once a robot is not fixed to one physical location, just like a human, its ability will be enhanced and then it can serve us better,\" Zhi says. \"We are committed to making the robots move easily within 1 kilometer for use in both indoor and outdoor scenarios, including hotels, office buildings, shopping malls, hospitals, communities and so forth.\" Founded in 2014, the company currently has nearly 40 service robots operating in hotels, offices and office buildings. They work at almost 30 high-end hotels. Equipped with advanced positioning systems, bellhop can automatically identify and avoid obstacles and people. Once a robot becomes part of the Internet of Things, it can communicate with elevators, move between hotel floors, arrive at the door, notify guests of telephone calls, deliver items they need, such as food, water and towels. In July, Yunji signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Changcheng Property Group, a leading Chinese property enterprise. The two companies will conduct research on possible applications of service robots in communities. It is expected such robots will materialize by the end of this year or at the beginning of next year, and become operational in the middle of 2017. \"It is a huge industry,\" Zhi says. \"The Chinese commercial-use robotics market will reach tens of billions of yuan by 2018.\" Wang Tianran, an academician at the China Academy of Engineering, told Xinhua News Agency earlier that China\\'s demand for service robots had grown rapidly.

Although China experienced a continuous economic slowdown for 24 quarters, the growth of the Producer Price Index has recently turned from negative to positive, showing an increase in Chinese companies\\' sales revenues and their ability to pay interest on loans. Meanwhile, the profit growth of industrial enterprises is accelerating, also indicating an improvement in companies\\' debt-repayment ability, according to Cao. \"We think the Chinese growth rate may have reached its bottom, so China will not ease monetary policy further to give a large-scale stimulus to the economy.

       " [\"The fine art of selling culture nan Leading international auction chief says Chinese collectors will play a pivotal role in future market Jussi Pylkkanen is the president of Christie's, one of the two biggest auction houses in the world. But he sees himself as more of an aficionado and part of the cultural landscape that connects museums, foundations and art dealers from all parts of the globe. A fan of Chinese porcelain and English glass, the 53-year-old Pylkkanen is the auctioneer at the center of the art world's biggest sales.  - Jussi Pylkkanen, global president of Christie's, takes a bid on a painting by Georges Seurat entitled Attelage Rural during the Impressionist and Modern Evening Art Sale in February 2015 in London, England. Getty Images  He believes China has a pivotal role to play in the global market as its collectors show an ever-growing interest in art, and auction sales in China continue their inexorable rise. Under Pylkkanen's leadership, Christie's recently opened its new central Beijing flagship center, part of a continued expansion in China. It is the second Christie's venue on the Chinese mainland after its Shanghai branch, which opened in 2014. According to Pylkkanen, the auction house is continuing to grow and invest in China and the new Beijing space is not only an important milestone in the auction house's 250-year mission to connect art and collectors but also illustrates its resolve to continue expansion in the country.  Pylkkanen recently spoke to China Daily about his China strategy, leadership style and personal life. The following are edited excerpts from the interview: Art collecting has been popular and auctions have done well in China over the past few years, as Chinese moguls have splashed out money on masterpieces. How would you describe the Christie's business in China in recent years? China is an absolutely critical part of the international art market today. Over the last three years, since our Shanghai office opened, we have witnessed huge growth in interest from Chinese collectors in all areas of the international art market - in Hong Kong, New York, London, Geneva and elsewhere. There is no question that in years to come the number of Chinese buyers - and Western buyers showing an interest in buying Chinese art - will grow very rapidly. We have witnessed this before, when we opened our business in North America in 1977. Quickly the US became a critical part of the market for us. As well as being a London-based company, we are also a multicultural company with significant operations across the world. How has the Christie's expansion in China been going so far? What strategies will you adopt to expand further? We already have three exhibition bases in China, which I am very proud of: the one in Hong Kong, which we have continuously developed over 30 years, a historical location in Shanghai and the new space in Beijing. We have the kind of exhibition spaces that no other businesses, other than the local Chinese ones, have. We are pleased to be the first Western company to have a broad, structured footprint in China and we will continuously grow. Is there a leadership style that is particularly effective in China? What is the proportion of Chinese and expats in your management team? We are trying to make Chinese collectors comfortable to work with our business. We have opened many relationships over the past 250 years. We have strong resources and love to get very close to museums, collectors and young artists. It's a combination of the classical and the new here in China. And Christie's gives collectors an international platform, which is very important. The management team in China is 100 percent Chinese. We have a staff in China of almost 50. They are all from the Chinese mainland. We want to build a business, which is all about being in China and run by Chinese. How hot is the competition that Christie's faces in China? What do you do to distinguish Christie's from competitors? We don't see anybody working in the art market as being a competitor. We see them as part of the art landscape that includes the museums, the foundations and the art dealers. It's one big community of art and culture. The more people dealing with art and culture, the better. We are leading our business with a team of many creative minds. What is your competitive edge in this community you describe? We have very high selling rates. We deliver what we promise. We like to do things well. Our exhibition spaces in Beijing brought out the exhibition on Pablo Picasso and other Chinese artists, and when we opened the space in Shanghai in 2014 we did the same thing. People know we take our responsibilities seriously. We make sure the culture and art of every nation is well represented. I'm currently on a tour, visiting museums, collectors and foundations and looking for exhibition spaces, and with all of them we want to reach out to the community. What are the biggest achievements, opportunities and challenges for Christie's in China? If we look at the commercial side, 28 percent of our buyers last year came from Asia, and 40 to 50 percent of those were from China. We sold around $6 or $7 billion (6.6 billion euros; 5.6 billion) -worth of artwork last year. It's a very healthy environment and many people want to create relationships with us. Some of them are buyers, some want to come and learn about the art market, and some come to the education courses provided by Christie's. In China we are launching a new education course with Yale University, based in Beijing. As more Chinese moguls buy world-famous works of art, do you think there's now a trend for art collections to house a major portion of global wealth? People have been collecting artwork for over two centuries. People have been collecting as a symbol of their wealth and their position for many years - hundreds of years - and it continues today. It's normal. It's part of a culture that we are all in. Some compare China's current art-collecting phenomenon with that of Japan in the mid '80s, when wealthy Japanese were chasing impressionist masterpieces. What do you think? Japanese collectors have fantastic taste. They bought beautiful things and continue to buy beautiful pieces. The Chinese collectors are doing the same. There are sometimes financial ups and downs and I wouldn't call it a Japanese issue. The Japanese are continuing to collect art pieces and the Chinese are now, too. The Chinese just arrived more recently in the market than the Japanese. The Japanese have had a long time to collect. Japan's economy subsequently went into deep recession due to the bursting of an asset bubble, and the art market followed. Will China experience a similar fate and how can it avoid that? I don't think so. The Chinese economy is very strong. As long as the Chinese economy, or any economy in the world, is strong, there will be individuals able and wanting to collect works of art. During your trips to China, is there a place that particularly impressed you? Of all the places I have ever been to, the Forbidden City stands out as incredible. I was able to go with our top specialist who showed me the wonderful pieces and porcelain in the museum. That was really a highlight for me. They are magnificent. What are your hobbies? How do you spend your time off-duty while in China? I collect contemporary art from across the world. But I also collect artwork, like glass from my home country, England. It's very close to the porcelain in China. What's your favorite piece of artwork? I love collecting artwork and I'm a passionate collector of Scandinavian and modern British glass. And one of my favorites is Modigliani's painting Nu Couch, Reclining Nude. In recent years we have created very meaningful relationships with collectors in China, and the Long Museum in China bought it last year. zhengxin@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/02/2016 page31)\"],\n",

The opening of the operating theatre has been-delayed due to staffing issues. An RT? Investigates programme, Living On The List, broadcast last night revealed that the number of patients waiting for operations or medical procedures was significantly higher than published, and highlighted shortcomings in the way waiting lists were being processed. In the D¨¢il this evening, Mr Harris repeated that he was ashamed and said the RT? programme brought home the genuine pain and suffering of patients who are waiting far too long for treatment. The minister said the theatre would carry out 194 spinal operations. Mr Harris also said that by June an additional orthopaedic surgeon will be in place at the hospital.

News (@rtenews) February 7, 2017 Agreement with the HSE was also reached that paediatric scoliosis waiting times will be a maximum-of four-months by end of the year. The Minister for Health has also directed that the National Treatment Purchase Fund audit the practices in the hospitals highlighted in the individual cases in last night\\'s programme. It is very important that lessons are learnt to see exactly how each of those cases were handled, he said. The minister met the Health Service Executive-and the NTPF today about the disclosure that many more patients were awaiting treatment than had been thought. The D¨¢il is to hold a special debate on the programme on Thursday morning. Politicians and medical experts are demanding that the waiting list scandal be brought to an end. Political-reaction to waiting list figures The minister told the D¨¢il that the-day case waiting list of over 18 months will be eliminated by the end of June for all day case procedures through the NPTF. Mr Harris said that this will see over 2,000 patients begin to receive their treatment from March. - RT? broadcast evidence-showing-there are at least two other significant waiting lists that are not published by the-NTPF, which has responsibility for collating waiting list data. The documentary also dealt with difficulties encountered by patients, adults and children, in need of operations. The HSE-has apologised to patients and accepted some delays were unacceptably long. Following the programme, Minister Harris-said he was-\"ashamed\" and \"heartbroken\". Speaking on RT?\\'s Claire Byrne Live, Mr Harris said: \"I don\\'t think there\\'s any sugar-coating of this, I don\\'t think there\\'s any possibility, or any point in anybody saying anything other than that this is ... this is wrong, this is something that as a country we can\\'t stand over. It\\'s something that I as minister for health can\\'t stand over and it does make me feel ashamed.\" Mr Harris said extra capacity was needed in the health service - citing staff numbers, beds and building new hospitals. \"I feel ashamed. I feel heartbroken\" - Minister for Health Simon Harris tells #CBLive. #RTEInvestigates pic.twitter.com/4PSDvkPM1x \"?RT? News Now (@RTENewsNow) February 6, 2017 The Department of Health has confirmed that the current system for waiting lists was put in place in 2002 when the NTPF was established. Fianna F¨¢il-has said there is a need to get patients moving through the health system. The party\\'s health spokesman Billy Kelleher said \"we are exhausted from talking about reform\" and what is needed is output and delivery of service that puts patients first. Speaking on RT?\\'s Morning Ireland, Mr Kelleher said while there are clear management issues in the HSE, the lack of capacity in the-hospital system is the real problem. Mr Kelleher added that over recent years there has been a downgrading in the HSE in terms of capacity, out-put and productivity and it has resulted in the waiting lists growing longer and longer. Sinn F¨¦in\\'s health spokesperson Louise O\\'Reilly said \"the sad reality of these figures is that this is endemic of perpetual health crisis and one which is being concealed from public view by creative accounting and massaging of figures.\" Labour\\'s Alan Kelly said the public were tired of the lack of accountability and the minister needs to take a hard line with the HSE.- He also called for a full investigation of how the waiting lists were established. Hospital beds - the numbers The PA Consulting Report on Bed Capacity for the HSE in 2008-said that Ireland would need to have 17,843 public hospital beds by this year. Department of Health statistics show that the system currently has about 12,400 public inpatient and day beds. The PA study projected that the health service would need 19,822 public hospital beds, including critical care beds-by 2020. However, it said that if Ireland moved to a system where care shifted from large hospitals-to more community and home care, the acute bed need would fall to about 8,800 by 2020. That system was termed a \\'Preferred Health System\\' which the HSE called an \\'Integrated Health System\\' and which it said it would move towards. At the time, the HSE said that if the shift was fully achieved, Ireland would need 8,834 public hospital beds by 2020. However, if it was only 25% achieved, Ireland would need 16,174 public hospital beds by 2020. Ten years ago, the number of people on the national surgical and medical waiting list was 22,747 - according to NTPF figures. By 2011, the number had increased to 28,850 patients. At the end of last year, the national waiting list-for inpatient-or day case treatment had increased to 81,015. System is 2,000 beds-short, consultant says Professor Paud O\\'Regan, Consultant Physician at South Tipperary General Hospital in Clonmel, said the national system is about 2,000 beds short and as a result cases are being delayed and beds are being lost by acute admissions. Prof O\\'Regan said the end result is the awful stories that were on television last night. He said that if enough money was being put into the system, it was being extremely badly managed and-denied that consultants were not always available because they were occupied with private practices. He said consultants were always available but they were not being-given the opportunity to look after patients properly. Orthopaedic Surgeon at-Mayo General Hospital-Derek Bennett-has said that Ireland has produced-some of the best physicians, nurses and health care professionals and-exported them. Speaking on-RT?\\'s Today with Sean O\\'Rourke, he said-there are low numbers of specialists in Ireland and it was not simply a question of throwing more money at the jobs, but rather making them attractive to those applying. This included, he said, ensuring that surgeons have a staffed operating theatre and an outpatients\\' clinic available to them.- Meanwhile, Orthopaedic Surgeon at Crumlin-Children\\'s Hospital Pat Kiely-said none of the stories he saw on the RT?-investigates programme surprised him. He said Ireland is probably the lowest staffed country in western Europe when it comes to orthopaedics and population. He said there is not the staff to deploy the two orthopaedic theatres in Crumlin fully and there are two days this week where the spinal surgery in the hospital is not in use. Separately, there are 587 patients on trolleys, or wards, today waiting admission to a hospital bed, according to the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation. The hospitals worst affected are University Hospital Limerick with 46 waiting, University Hospital Galway with 44 and Beaumont Hospital with 40.'],\n",

The revelations have been pounced upon as evidence that the Government\\'s Brexit strategy is faltering, fuelling calls for a dedicated Brexit minister and a special status for Northern Ireland. The view from Brussels, and from officials with a keen knowledge of the EU\\'s customs rules, is more nuanced. But there is a distinct sense that Ireland should move up from the \"sympathy\"-gear it has-been operating, and to start making concrete solutions. \"There\\'s no doubt that people are sympathetic,\"-says one well-placed EU source. \"But sympathy only gets you so far. You may not find sympathy when you start proposing solutions. Will those solutions be acceptable to the other 26 member states?\" The reality is that Britain will be what is called a \"third country.\"- Since London wants to sign trade deals in other parts of the globe it will have to leave the customs union. That means it will be subject to tariffs on goods and services (unless there is a tariff free trade agreement with the EU after the two-year divorce negotiations). It also means the EU\\'s-external border will run through Ireland. To protect the EU single market from goods and services produced in the UK without the same regulatory and standards regime, there will have to be a customs regime between the two territories. Ireland is trying to fight its case against that brutal reality. EU officials say the Government has been extremely active in raising awareness about the key concerns: the trading relationship, the Common Travel Area, the Irish peace process (the Commission\\'s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has publicly asserted his deep knowledge, when he was regional affairs Commissioner, of European funds administered through the PEACE programmes for Northern Ireland). While Taoiseach Enda Kenny will carry Ireland\\'s flag once the negotiations start, the first line of defence is Ireland\\'s Permanent Representation to the EU, effectively Ireland\\'s embassy. The staff level has been boosted to around 90 officials to cope with the Brexit workload. Government ministers have also been fanning out across EU capitals to make Ireland\\'s case. Another line of defence is the Irish civil service. Officials have been making regular trips to Brussels since the autumn for highly technical discussions with officials from European Commission\\'s Task Force on Brexit (also known informally as TF50, after Article 50) who in turn call in experts from the commission\\'s Directorate Generals (DGs). One such meeting took place on Tuesday 24 January. Officials from four Government departments - Department of the Taoiseach, Foreign Affairs, Agriculture and the Revenue Commissioners \"?held long discussions with members of the Commission Task Force, which was joined by officials from the commission\\'s health, taxation and agriculture divisions. They worked on some of the key issues that will dominate the Irish debate on Brexit: customs checks, the movement of foodstuffs and live animals back and forth across the border post-Brexit, and energy issues;-including, among others, the implications for Ireland\\'s single electricity market, and for how Ireland\\'s energy security will be affected long-term, given that our future energy supply from the UK may come with tariffs attached. Lobby groups make their case on Brexit Lobby groups such as Ibec-have also been making their case, independent of government. On Thursday, the President of the Irish co-operative movement ICOS, Martin Keane, and chief executive TJ-Flanagan will meet two members of the commission\\'s Task Force --Tadhg O\\'Briain, who handles Irish and energy issues, and Nina Obermeier, an experienced commission official --as well as two officials from the commission\\'s-agriculture division, Bence Toth and Michael Niejahr. The nature of the ICOS meeting actually tells us a lot about the heightened concerns in Ireland. Many of these concerns are complicated, because they involve the disentanglement of complex supply chains running North and South, that have evolved over the years of Britain\\'s EU membership. \"We currently estimate that the adjustments needed to \\'detangle\\' these supply chains and reorganise business structures would take approximately ten years,\"-according to an ICOS briefing note. One of the key problems is the milk sector, especially given the heavy investment producers and processors have made to take advantage of the ending of milk quotas. Every year, 600 million litres of milk produced in Northern Ireland are carried by tanker across the border to be processed in the Republic. Of this, 120 million litres is sold as liquid milk. That accounts for 25%-of the Irish milk supply. Part of the reason northern producers supply so much is because they are incentivised to produce milk during the winter months, something not done in the Republic. Brexit will have a serious impact on this trade thanks to potential tariffs and customs controls. It could also require a shift in southern milk production to winter supply. More seriously again, recent investments in processing facilities could be undermined. The other problem is that milk from Northern Ireland may have to be kept out of dairy production in the Republic of Ireland, which is sold across the EU single market and beyond to global consumers. If milk from Northern Ireland is not EU milk then, under origin labelling rules, it would not be acceptable to the rest of Europe and beyond. Animal movement could be affected by Brexit Live animal movement could also be devastated by Brexit. Every week around 10,000 pigs, and 1,000 bovines move back and forth across the border as part of the normal slaughtering and processing activity. This can currently operate unhindered because operators on both sides of the border comply with EU rules on animal safety, animal health and welfare, disease control and traceability. But once Brexit happens, Northern Ireland farmers and producers will-not be covered by those rules \"?unless Britain agrees at the end of a tortuous negotiation process to bind itself to such regulations (politically a very hard sell for Brexiteers). ICOS will propose to the commission, for example, that milk from Northern Ireland be designated as \"Irish\"-milk, to get around these issues. But that could invite a host of problems, not least a backlash from both Dublin and Belfast. Again, this is instructive as to how difficult things will become for the Irish Government once the negotiations get under way. Part of the critique of the Government\\'s approach in Brussels is that Dublin has felt it must first secure an understanding with the UK on the monumental border and trade problems, and that the other 27 member states will fall into line, because Ireland is a \"special case\". \"We\\'r trying to remind them,\"-says one EU official. \"This is not just a common travel area between Ireland and the UK, this is a common travel area between a third country and the EU. \"One cannot assume there won\\'t be a problem simply because Britain and Ireland issue a statement saying there won\\'t be a problem.\" The official continues: \"Food standards will be the big issue. We have to protect [EU] food standards. Arguments that Ireland is a special case are all very fine. Will they fit into a European context? Irish stakeholders claim they have a special case. How do you think that will travel? \"If there are protections for Irish farmers it\\'s not much consolation to a beef producer in France who sells into the UK market and who wants to compete on a level playing pitch. \"If you have a special deal for Ireland which discriminates against other producers in other countries it simply isn\\'t going to fly.\" Irish sources reject any idea that the Government has been naÃ¯ve in the whole question of how \"seamless\"-or \"frictionless\"-a post-Brexit border will be. \"There is a border, and there will be customs checks,\" says one source familiar with the technical discussions between Dublin and Brussels. \"Nothing has changed. The public debate is, however, becoming more focused. \"There is an EU customs code and we need to operate within that. But just because there will be customs checks it doesn\\'t mean that it will be a military style border.\" The technical discussions, which are happening now at least once a month, are a chance for the Government to \"educate\"-commission officials, who will feed the intelligence into the negotiating process once Article 50 is triggered. But with each meeting, new technical issues arise, and officials have to drill deeper into the dark seams of EU expertise. Where the technical ends and the political begins is another issue. Minister for Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan has been charting a more political course, meeting his counterparts across Europe (this week Finland, Italy and Belgium), either in foreign capitals, Brussels or Dublin. The Taoiseach has met the Spanish prime minister in Madrid and will meet his Polish counterpart this week. In both cases one can assume that Mr Kenny is both explaining Ireland\\'s issues, and reassuring his counterparts over their\\'s (Gibraltar-for Spain, and the rights of Irish citizens in the UK for Poland). The Government has to be delicate, however. It cannot push hard position papers over to the commission\\'s Task Force which might immediately be rejected. But at a certain point, Dublin will have to spell out how it wants the problems posed by Brexit on the Irish border to be fixed. \"[Chief negotiator Michel] Barnier is not going to come up with solutions,\"-says one EU source. \"Ireland needs to come up with solutions. The problems are understood, and the circumstances are understood. But Ireland needs solutions, it will have to come up with solutions.\" Will there be a \\'frictionless\\' border?- Another reason Ireland will need those solutions is more prosaic. If a new customs regime has to be installed in Ireland, it will take time. Much of the focus has been on using technology to deliver that \"frictionless\"-border: a crude example would be the way licence plate scanning technology facilitates the proxy payment of tolls on the M50. There is no doubt that customs registration can be done electronically in advance of trucks crossing a border. But there will still have to be checks. \"You can\\'t do it without physical controls,\"-says one EU source familiar with customs operations. \"Sure, there aren\\'t as many checks, there are computer programmes assessing risks. But you can\\'t get away from physical inspections.\" What that means is that there will be the illusion of frictionless travel. Sources suggest that, post-Brexit, not all trucks will be stopped, and they will not necessarily be stopped on the actual land border. Figuring out how to set up a customs post on the M1 Belfast to Dublin route is the stuff of nightmares. The checks might be more discreet, and a road station \"?where trucks are checked - might move to Balbriggan or Swords, for example. \"If you are a haulier you are still likely to end up in a 40 acre road station,\"-the source says. \"There will still have to be a physical examination. There may be less pain and paperwork, but the notion that it can be done without physical inspections is fanciful.\" This brings to mind the \"Brexit Fairy\" - memorably conjured up by Steve Peers, Professor of EU Law at the University of Essex --\"who will magically solve all problems which Brexit might create.\" There are 300 roads crossing the Irish border and no-one is suggesting there will be checks on each one. But if the UK is out of the customs union and if there are two-way tariffs, customs and excise duties between what will be EU territory and \"third country\"-territory, then it will be a criminal offence to bring certain kinds of goods, or a certain value of goods across the border without customs clearance. What causes most concern is how co-operative the UK will be on the infrastructure front, once the new system is required. \"Ireland will operate its rules,\"-says another official familiar with EU customs rules. \"But how close will the UK come to what Ireland is doing? Will they want to build glass customs posts ... or concrete ones?\" All these things will need planning. But the Government, and therefore Irish customs officials, are effectively hamstrung, not just before the negotiations start, but before there is a shape on how they will end up. The new systems will also have to be backed by EU legislation. \"That will be difficult. You\\'ll need staff operating the new regime. They\"\\x99ll need to be trained, and to be familiar with each other\\'s systems. It will be a challenge. How smoothly can we do this?\" But there are other scenarios that will have to be confronted. A haulier driving from Dundalk to Letterkenny will cross the EU border twice before reaching his or her destination. In theory the driver could have to make two customs declarations. Here is where we get into the realm of TIR carnets. For those of you, myself included, who have ever wondered what those initials on the back of a truck stand for, now is the moment of revelation. Transports Internationaux Routiers derive from a 1975 convention that allowed truckers to transit their goods across territories without making any deliveries there. A TIR carnet is a customs document which describes the goods, the shipper and the destination. It is a financial guarantee that the driver is not going to surreptitiously deliver goods in a country he is only supposed to be transiting. When he arrives at a customs post the import duties and taxes are suspended, and if he passes through (to Letterkenny, say), no taxes are due. If, however, he delivers in Northern Ireland, then the taxes are billed to the importer and the financial bond backstops the importer\\'s obligation to pay the taxes. The lorry must also be sealed as well as carrying the bond. As well as applying to transit from Dundalk to Letterkenny, it will also affect a huge proportion of Irish exports which transit through Liverpool and Dover to the European continent, or via air freight from Gatwick. This procedure most often happens in countries like Russia and Ukraine, Turkey and countries in the Middle East. The TIR procedure became unnecessary for intra-EU transport once the EU created the single market. But Britain is leaving the single market.'],\n",
       " ['No renegotiation on Brexit deal if rejected by MPs nan Britain will not seek further talks with the European Union if parliament rejects the exit deal it reaches, the British government said in a statement, as ministers resisted pressure to give politicians more say on the terms of the final agreement. The statement, which echoes British Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s stance that \"no deal is better than a bad deal,\" came as parliament debated a law that would give her the power to begin exit negotiations with the EU. Last month, Mrs May promised to ask parliament to approve the final exit terms, but said that even if it rejected the deal, Britain would leave the EU, raising concern among some politicians that their vote would be purely symbolic. Asked whether the government would go back to the negotiating table if parliament rejected the deal, junior Brexit minister David Jones said: \"I can\\'t think of a greater signal of weakness than for this House to send the government back to the European Union and to say we want to negotiate further ... therefore I can\\'t agree with it.\" Mr Jones also said that if Britain and the EU could not come to a Brexit deal within the two-year timeframe allowed under Article 50 of the EU\\'s Lisbon Treaty, Britain would ultimately fall back on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms of trade. Opposition politicians want to use the bill going through parliament as a way to attach extra conditions to Mrs May\\'s plan to trigger Brexit talks by 31 March. The most contentious focus on calls for a \"meaningful vote\" on the final exit deal and could see an embarrassing defeat for the government if enough members of Mrs May\\'s Conservative Party defy their leader\\'s wishes. That vote will take place later today. Seeking to allay any such rebellion, Mr-Jones said that parliament would be given a vote on the final deal before the European Parliament debates and votes on the agreement. MPs reacted angrily when it emerged they would not be able to force the government back to the negotiating table. \"MPs must not be duped by the government\\'s attempt to quell unrest on their back benches,\" said one Green Party MP. \"The vote they\\'re offering - which will give MPs a choice between an extreme Brexit and falling off a cliff edge into WTO trade rules - isn\\'t a concession, it\\'s an ultimatum.\"'],\n",

Mr Trump has called for an additional 5,000 Customs and Border Protection agents and 10,0000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in an executive order, but he did not specify a timeline. Mr Kelly told a congressional hearing that he would not \"skip on training and standards\" to speed up the pace of hiring. He also said the US-is not considering adding any countries to its list of seven whose nationals were temporarily banned-from entering the country on visas. Mr Kelly was responding to reports that the Trump administration was considering adding 12 countries to the list. The US-Justice Department will face off with opponents in a federal appeals court today over the fate of President Donald Trump\\'s temporary travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries, his most controversial act since taking office last month. Last Friday, US-District Judge James Robart suspended Mr Trump\\'s ban, opening a window for people from the seven affected countries to enter the country. The 9th US-Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco will hear arguments over whether to restore the ban from Justice Department lawyers and opposing attorneys for the states of Minnesota and Washington at 3pm Pacific time. Today, Mr Trump said that he needed the appeals court to go his way, saying a lot of \"bad people\" are thinking of going to the United States. The US president made the comments during an appearance at the White House in which he also criticised Senate delays of his cabinet nominees, including Scott Pruitt for the Environmental Protection Agency.

Donal Scanlon was working for Bryan and Coakley Ltd., trading as B&C Services of Marlhill Court, Foxhole Industrial Estate in Youghal, when the incident occurred on 18 November 2015. The court was told that Mr Scanlon, who was employed as an apprentice fitter, was cutting an oil drum with a plasma cutter when the lid blew off and struck him in the head. He was airlifted to Cork University Hospital, where he later died. Waste oil and fumes inside the drum were ignited by the plasma cutter causing the explosion. The drum was being prepared to be used to store scrap metal and Judge Se¨¢n Ã\\x93 Donnabh¨¢in said:-\"There is invariably going to be waste in the drum. This is fairly fundamental. It is a fundamental breach of safety\". The company has two directors, Mark Coakley and Ivan Bryan, and a guilty plea was entered by Mr Coakley on behalf of the company to a charge of failing to provide a safe and well-organised system of work. Judge Ã\\x93 Donnabh¨¢in said the explosion was \"entirely preventable\". He added: \"The culpability of the company is high.

The Ministry of Public Health said that 41 others were wounded and taken to Kabul hospitals. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, in which police said an apparent suicide bomber targeted Supreme Court employees leaving their offices at the end of the working day. The bomber appeared to have entered an area where guards were performing security checks when he detonated the explosives. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack as a \"crime against humanity and an unforgivable act\". The Supreme Court was the target of a bomb in June 2013, when a suicide bomber drove an explosives-packed car into a bus carrying court employees, including judges. The Taliban claimed responsibility for that attack, and since then security near the court has been increased with large concrete blast walls. In 2015 a Taliban bomber killed five prosecutors from the office of the Attorney General in Kabul, and last year Taliban gunmen stormed a legal office in Logar province, killing seven people, including two prosecutors. The same militant group killed four people at a provincial courthouse in Ghazni in 2016. Last month, bombers killed more than 30 people and wounded about 70 in twin blasts in a crowded area of Kabul during the afternoon rush hour. The Islamist militant Taliban, fighting to oust foreign forces and bring down the US-backed government, claimed responsibility for that attack on 10 January. Afghan government forces control no more than two-thirds of national territory, and have struggled to contain the insurgency since the bulk of NATO soldiers withdrew at the end of 2014. Several thousand foreign troops, most of them Americans, remain in training and counter-terrorism roles.-'],\n",
       " ['Man sentenced to three years over social welfare fraud nan The largest known social welfare fraud case uncovered with the use of facial recognition software has led to a man being sentenced to three years in prison. Adrian Vaduva, 44, who pleaded guilty, obtained more than \\x80180,000 in fraudulent social welfare payments over a 16-year period. He was only found out when a picture taken of him was matched with the picture of another man also claiming social welfare. It proved that they-were one and the same and that Vaduva had been using a false name to claim double benefits. Wexford Circuit Court heard that Vaduva, who has an address at Riverchapel,-Gorey, came to Ireland from Romania in 1999.-He was refused asylum but returned five months later with a false birth certificate and ID and gave his name as Eduard Preda. He was granted asylum and started claiming social welfare payments and allowances under the false name. Romania joined the EU in 2008 and Vaduva then began claiming social welfare payments under his own name, while also collecting payments as Eduard Preda. The fraud was carried out at various post offices in Dublin, Cork, Kerry, Arklow and Wexford. Up until the summer of 2015 he had collected a total of \\x80180,828 using the two identities. The court heard that a relatively new Cogent Facial Imaging Matching Software (CFIMS) system used by the Department of Social Protection was instrumental in detecting the fraud. \"Eduard Preda\" was invited to have a photograph taken of himself in 2015-under department guidelines and \"Adrian Vaduva\" was invited last summer. Breda Murphy of the department\\'s staff in Wexford alerted Garda Kevin Heffernan to the case last June after the software matched the two photos and showed that both Vaduva and Preda were in fact the same man. Garda Heffernan, on secondment to the Department of Social Protection, told the court it was evident \"Eduard Preda\" and \"Adrian Vaduva\" were the same person. Vaduva was arrested in Arklow last summer and-admitted the fraud, including renting a flat in Wexford which was supposed to be the address for \"Eduard Preda\". He was paying \\x80100 a month in rent but receiving almost \\x801,000 in payments and Garda Heffernan described it as an elaborate scheme. Vaduva co-operated fully with the investigation and garda¨ª-say it would have been difficult to prove the case back to 1999 if he had not been so upfront. The court was told Vaduva had not accumulated any of the money but was using it to live on. He also paid money for his sick mother and he had three children in Romania, one of whom is seriously ill. He only had \\x8010 on him when arrested and had no money in his bank accounts. Vaduva cried throughout the court hearing and the court heard he sobbed throughout his interviews with garda¨ª. Describing him as an emotional man, Judge Barry Hickson said the new CFIMS software had been instrumental in this case. The judge said the social welfare system has been deprived of almost \\x80100,000. He sentenced Vaduva to three years in jail and suspended the last nine months, backdating the sentence to last June when he was first arrested.'],\n",

Facilities would be-staffed by medics trained to deal with overdoses where users can access sterile needles and rooms to inject drugs they have brought with them. It would effectively legalise possession of heroin in the unit, but it would still be illegal to sell or supply drugs inside or outside the facility. The first pilot injecting centre is due to be opened in Dublin city centre in the autumn. The locations of the other facilities have not yet been decided. The legislation is expected to be introduced in the D¨¢il in the coming weeks. The Department of Health-said the experience from 90 facilities around the world showed a reduction in fatal overdoses and transmission of blood-borne diseases, less drug-related litter and no increase in drug usage or drug-related crime. Speaking on-RT?\\'s News at One, Minister of State Catherine Byrne said that injection centres should not result in more drug use or drug related crime. However, she said they would reduce the risk of fatal overdose and blood borne viruses. Ms Byrne said there is already a cohort of people injecting openly in Dublin.

Any decision on the location of the pilot facility will be informed by the outcome of this consultation process.\" A company representing businesses and cultural centres in Temple Bar said the decision effectively is a decriminalisation of drug use in certain areas of Dublin city. The Temple Bar Company said it does not believe a measured approach has been taken, saying that injection centres are implemented as part of a unified approach to tackling addiction in other countries. It said in other countries, \"adequate policing is in place to manage additional numbers of addicts into these areas and drugs are safely dispensed and medically supervised unlike the Government\\'s proposals where people will carry drugs to and from centres\".- Separately, Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform-Paschal Donohoe brought a memo to Cabinet on a new approach to review certain day-to-day expenditure by Government departments over a period.

       " ['Assad says \\'defending\\' Syria more important than UN tribunal nan Syria\\'s-President Bashar al-Assad has said that \"defending\" his country in a time of war was more important than any international tribunal that may be brought against his government later. His comments to Belgian media came as rights watchdog Amnesty International accused the regime of hanging 13,000 at an infamous prison near Damascus. According to an English-language transcript of the interviews published by Syrian state news agency SANA today, Mr Assad accused United Nations institutions of acting unfairly towards his country. \"We all know that the United Nations institutions are not unbiased, they are biased because of the American influence and the French and British, mainly,\" he said. \"They are only politicised to implement the agenda of those countries,\" he added. Syria\\'s conflict first broke out in March 2011 with widespread protests that descended into violence. Asked whether he was concerned about a potential court case brought against the regime at the UN\\'s highest court in The Hague, Mr Assad said he and other Syrian officials \"don\\'t care\". \"For me, as president, when I do my duty, the same for the government and for the army, to defend our country, we don\\'t look to this issue, we don\\'t care about it,\" he said. \"We have to defend our country by every mean, and when we have to defend it by every mean, we don\\'t care about this court, or any other international institution,\" Mr Assad added. The UN General Assembly in December agreed to begin gathering evidence on war crimes in Syria as a first step towards prosecuting those responsible for atrocities there. At the time, Syria\\'s Ambassador Bashar Jafaari slammed the measure, calling it a \"flagrant interference in the internal affairs of a UN member-state\". But in a new report published today, Amnesty International said Syria\\'s government had carried out a deliberate \"policy of extermination\" at the Saydanaya military prison. The report found that as many as 13,000 people were killed in mass hangings at the facility between 2011 and 2015. The rights group accused-the regime of a \"policy of extermination\". The report on Saydnaya prison is based on interviews with 84 witnesses,-including guards, detainees, and judges. Warning: Disturbing content It found that at least once a week between 2011 and 2015, groups of up to 50 people were taken out of their prison cells for arbitrary trials, beaten, then hanged \"in the middle of the night and in total secrecy\". \"Throughout this process, they remain blindfolded. They do not know when or how they will die until the noose was placed around their necks,\" the rights group wrote. Amnesty said the practices amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity, but were likely still taking place. Thousands of prisoners are held in the military-run Saydnaya prison, one of the country\\'s largest detention centres located 30km-north of Damascus. Amnesty accused the Syrian government of carrying out a \"policy of extermination\" there by repeatedly torturing detainees and withholding food, water-and medical care. Prisoners were raped or forced to rape each other, and guards would feed detainees by tossing meals onto the cell floor, which was often covered in dirt and blood. A twisted set of \"special rules\" governed the facility: detainees were not allowed to speak and must assume certain positions when guards enter their cells. The group has previously said that more than 17,700 people were estimated to have died in government custody across Syria since the country\\'s conflict erupted in March 2011. The figure of 13,000 deaths in a single prison, therefore, is a marked increase. \"The horrors depicted in this report reveal a hidden, monstrous campaign, authorised at the highest levels of the Syrian government, aimed at crushing any form of dissent within the Syrian population,\" said Lynn Maalouf, deputy director for research at Amnesty\\'s Beirut office. \"The cold-blooded killing of thousands of defenceless prisoners, along with the carefully crafted and systematic programmes of psychological and physical torture that are in place inside Saydnaya Prison cannot be allowed to continue,\" she said. A probe by the UN last year accused Mr Assad\\'s government of a policy of \"extermination\" in its jails. More than 310,000 people have been killed and millions have fled their homes since the conflict began with anti-Assad protests.'],\n",
       " ['French ex-president Sarkozy to face trial over campaign nan A magistrate has ordered former French president Nicolas Sarkozy to stand trial over irregularities in the funding of his failed 2012 re-election bid, a judicial source has said. The charge against Mr Sarkozy, who led France for five years from 2007, exposes the 62-year old conservative politician to a one-year prison sentence if convicted. One of two magistrates handling the case ordered the trial on the charge that Mr Sarkozy spent way more than he was entitled to, despite warnings from his accountants. The source, who was speaking on condition of anonymity as is often the case in France when initial announcements of trials are made, said 13 others would also face trial over the affair. The source said it was still possible that an appeal could be lodged against the trial order because it was signed by only one of the two magistrates in charge of the case. No comment could be immediately obtained from Mr Sarkozy\\'s aides. The trial order comes at a time when French politicians face growing scrutiny over their personal and political finances in the build-up to this year\\'s presidential election in April and May. Mr Sarkozy\\'s conservative predecessor Jacques Chirac was convicted in 2011, after his retirement, of misusing public funds to keep political allies in phantom jobs. That was the first conviction of a French head of state since Nazi collaborator Marshal Philippe Petain in 1945. Conservative Francois Fillon, who beat rivals including Mr Sarkozy to become the centre-right\\'s candidate in this year\\'s race, has been engulfed by a scandal over payments of public funds to his wife and children. Far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen is also being pursued by the European Parliament to refund money paid to her bodyguard and another person. Meanwhile, the other presidential candidate, Emmanuel Macron, has denied a gay-ex-marital affair with Radio France chief executive Mathieu Gallet. Late last night, Mr Macron sought to quash the rumours, saying: \"If you\\'re told I lead a double life with Mr Gallet it\\'s because my hologram has escaped\". A spokeswoman said the comments were \"a clear denial of the rumours about his private life\". French politics has a long history of financial and personal scandals, and the country\\'s media has become less shy about reporting the private life of public figures in the social media age. Revelations about the love child of former president Francois Mitterrand took years to come out in the press, even though the facts were widely known by journalists while he was in power between 1981 and 1995. - - - - - - But photographs of current president, Francois Hollande, arriving outside the flat of actress Julie Gayet on the back of a motor scooter were splashed across front pages while he was officially still in another relationship.- - --'],\n",

Dublin City University Professor Colum Kenny said while he did not view the potential take over in personal terms, he said he had \"difficulties\" appearing before a committee looking at the take over of INM on which Mr Lowry sits.- \"I think there\\'s a conflict of interest\", he said. He also expressed concern over the lack of \"firm details\" regarding the takeover and said such circumstances made it difficult to give an informed position. Prof-Kenny said he did not understand how the committee had been asked to make a consideration of a matter before the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland had considered it and described the procedure as \"awkward\". The business model in local newspapers is broken according to the chief executive officer of CMNL. In his opening statement to the Oireachtas Communications Committee, Frank Mulrennan said the company and the jobs of 98 people earning \\x801.8m-in salaries almost went out of business in 2012, due to the weight of bank debts and continuing falling revenues. Mr-Mulrennan said his colleagues were hugely supportive of the management buyout, which he said he led in June 2012 because their jobs, and 950 years of newspaper history was secured. He said 25% of the equity was allocated to editors, sales managers and production managers.- Mr Mulrennan said Celtic Media Newspapers borrowed \\x801.5m-in 2012, but five years later, the company is faced with a \"broken business model\" in terms of publishing local newspapers. He requested that the committee approach the sale with an open mind, ignoring the very considerable noise around the issue in the national media, but a noise he said that-had nothing to do with the job security of workers.'],\n",

Conway, a counselor to the president, made the remarks on Fox News on Thursday morning, responding to the recent decision by Nordstrom to remove Ivanka Trump items from its shelves. \"This is just a wonderful line. I own some of it, I fully \"?I\\'m going to give a free commercial here,\" Conway said. \"Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online.\" Former White House ethics officials and other legal experts said her endorsement appears to be a clear-cut violation of an ethics regulation barring executive branch employees from endorsing products and using their public office for the private gain of friends. Kathleen Clark, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis and a member of the D.C. Bar rules of professional conduct review committee, told ABC News, \"It is accurate to say that she broke the law. It\\'s not a criminal law. It\\'s a regulation.\" Clark added that the action would normally prompt some type of \"employment discipline\" within the White House.     Norm Eisen, who was an ethics czar for the Obama White House, said on MSNBC that the comments amounted to \"a violation of the rules, pure and simple.\" \"I imagine that you are going to see complaints flowing in,\" Eisen said. \"The responsibility to oversee this in the first instance is with the White House counsel, Don McGahn. He is going to need to look at the rules, look at the president and decide what range of penalties might apply.\" Richard Painter, who was an ethics lawyer for George W. Bush\\'s White House, would not say in an interview that Conway broke the law, but he spelled out what the regulation clearly prohibits. \"It is a violation of federal ethics regulations prohibiting use of public office for private gain for any government employee in an official speech, an official capacity TV interview or any similar communication to promote the products or services of a particular private business belonging to the employee\\'s own family, the president\\'s family, a friend, a campaign contributor or anyone else,\" Painter said. \"That was strictly forbidden in the Bush administration because it is illegal.\" The nonprofit watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington said Thursday it has already filed a complaint with the Office of Government Ethics and the White House counsel\\'s office over Conway\\'s comments. \"This is just another example of what looks like a disturbing pattern of this administration acting to benefit the businesses of the president\\'s family and supporters,\" the group\\'s executive director, Noah Bookbinder, said in a press release. \"Americans are unfortunately at the point where they have to question who the Trump administration is looking out for, the American people or the Trump family.\" Former White House Cabinet secretary Chris Lu said on Twitter that if officials in the Obama White House had been caught making similar comments, it likely would have cost them their job.  My Obama WH colleagues can chime in. If we did what @KellyannePolls did, we would\\'ve been fired. Then again, our boss cared about ethics  ABC News has requested comment from the White House, the Office of Government Ethics and the office of House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz but did not immediately receive any responses. Nordstrom has said its decision to remove Ivanka Trump\\'s clothing line is related to sales and was not politically motivated. From his personal Twitter account, President Donald Trump on Wednesday tweeted that Nordstrom treated his daughter \"unfairly.\" That was retweeted by the official POTUS account. Ivanka Trump said in an earlier statement that she would no longer be \"involved with the management or operations of\" her brand or the Trump Organization. On Wednesday, Eisen criticized Trump for his tweet about Nordstrom and suggested that Nordstrom should sue under unfair competition laws that prohibit the type of behavior displayed in Trump\\'s tweet. \"I do believe Nordstrom has a colorful claim,\" Eisen said. \"This will be another place where the courts will remind him he\\'s not above the law.\" On Twitter, Eisen even offered to help Nordstrom should the company decide to file a suit.

Spicer first made an Atlanta reference during a Jan. 29 appearance on ABC\\'s \"This Week,\" telling chief global affairs correspondent Martha Raddatz, \"What do we say to the family who loses somebody over a terroristic \"?to whether it\\'s Atlanta or San Bernardino or the Boston bomber?

       " ['ANALYSIS: Trump White House Plays Terrorism Blame Game nan The Trump administration has a blunt message: Be afraid. And if something goes wrong, blame the third branch of government and the fourth estate. That\\'s the message emanating from the White House, starting with President Trump, just three weeks into his hectic presidency. The president is arguing that the terrorism threat is far worse than most people imagine -\"?and that forces, including the judiciary and the news media, are potentially making the United States less safe. \"Believe me,\"?the president told a law enforcement gathering in Washington Wednesday morning, \"I\\'ve learned a lot in the last two weeks, and terrorism is a far greater threat than people understand.\"?And, as he\\'s done multiple times over the past week, he turned his attention to a federal judiciary, which has put the brakes on his executive order limiting migration from seven predominantly Muslim countries. \"right now, we are at risk because of what happened,\"?Trump said. As scrutiny has grown over his travel ban, Trump has cast it as central to his mission of keeping Americans safe. He\\'s lashed out at the federal judge who effectively put the policy on hold with a temporary restraining order, tweeting that \"if something happens blame him,\"?and saying that even a \"bad high-school student\"?would understand that the president\\'s order is legal. He also has taken his attack to the media. A \"lery, very dishonest press\"?is failing to report on terrorist attacks in Europe, the president said. His White House put out a typo-ridden list of attacks the administration believes demonstrates that some were under-covered, which included several incidents with tenuous links to terrorists, as well as incidents that were widely covered: Orlando, San Bernardino, Paris. Along the way, the warnings coming from his administration have become more urgent and ominous. \"What we can\"t do is wait for the next attack to come,\"?White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Wednesday. \"not until the boom,\" warned Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly on Tuesday, when pressed by a member of Congress on what proof the administration has that people are coming to the U.S. with the intent to harm Americans. \"the world is an angry place,\"?the president himself told ABC News\\' David Muir, in the first major television interview of his presidency. It\\'s a rhetorical break with the main message coming from the last two presidents, one a Democrat and one a Republican. Their general stance even after 9/11 was to reassure Americans and urge them to go on about their daily business. For Trump, the tone appears to have policy implications. A president who claims to know the public\\'s sentiments without polls is seeking to claim the mantle of public support for an agenda that aims to be more aggressive in combating threats. If, to Trump and his allies, the ends justify those means, it\\'s instructive to game out how Trump might cast an attack on Americans under his watch. The president appears to see enemies everywhere, including inside the country he leads.'],\n",

McCain, the head of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told NBC on Wednesday that when a mission leads to the loss of life, \"I don\\'t believe you can call it a success.\" \"My understanding of the parameters of the raid were that they wanted to capture individuals, and obviously they didn\\'t want to kill children or women,\"?McCain said.

       " ['Republican State Lawmakers Push for Restrictions on Voting nan As President Donald Trump hurls unfounded allegations of colossal fraud in last fall\\'s election, lawmakers in at least 20 mostly Republican-led states are pushing to make it harder to register or to vote. Efforts are underway in places such as Arkansas, Iowa, Maine, Nebraska and Indiana to adopt or tighten requirements that voters show identification at the polls. There is a move in Iowa and New Hampshire to eliminate Election Day registration. New Hampshire may also make it difficult for college students to vote. And Texas could shorten the early voting period by several days. Supporters say the measures are necessary to combat voter fraud and increase public confidence in elections. But research has shown that in-person fraud at the polls is extremely rare, and critics of these restrictions warn that they will hurt mostly poor people, minorities and students \"?all of whom tend to vote Democratic \"?as well as the elderly. They fear, too, that the U.S. Justice Department, under newly confirmed Attorney General Jeff Sessions, will do little to intervene to protect voters. Some election watchers see voting rights under heavy attack. \"What is really happening here is an attempt to manipulate the system so that some people can participate and some people can\\'t,\" said Myrna Perez, director of the Voting Rights and Elections project at New York University\\'s Brennan Center for Justice. Even so, there are more bills around the country aimed at making it easier to vote, according to the Brennan Center. Starting or expanding early voting and creating automatic voter registration are two popular proposals. Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, for example, is backing a proposal to automatically register people to vote using their motor vehicle paperwork and to offer early voting for 12 days before Election Day. Many of the restrictive laws became possible after the U.S. Supreme Court in 2013 struck down a key provision of the federal Voting Rights Act that required certain states and counties, largely in the South, to get Justice Department approval before changing their election laws. The 2016 presidential election was the first without those protections, and voters in 14 states faced new restrictions on voting or registration. Kevin Hall, spokesman for the Iowa Secretary of State, said proposed legislation would provide non-photo identification cards to anyone who doesn\\'t have another acceptable form of ID, such as a driver\\'s license or passport. The bill would also update voting system technology. \"This is a commonsense approach just to protect the integrity of our election,\" he said. \"We want to make sure it\\'s secure and boost voter confidence as well.\" Other states such as Maine and Nebraska, meanwhile, are looking to require photo identification for voting. In addition to eliminating same-day registration, New Hampshire Republicans want to add a residency requirement that critics say could prevent college students from voting. People can now vote in New Hampshire if they consider it their home. Proponents say the new measure would ensure that only people who truly live in the state can take part in elections. Many of these measures are certain to face court challenges. Before the presidential election, federal courts rolled back some of the toughest restrictions in North Carolina and Texas. Those cases are still working their way through the legal system, and voting rights groups are worried the new attorney general will abandon efforts made under the Obama administration to fight the restrictions. Over the past few years, \"states and localities were emboldened unlike ever before in employing a wide range of tactics to deny voting rights to people of color and people with disabilities,\" said Scott Simpson with the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. \"We expect that this will get much worse with a Justice Department that is hostile to voting rights.\" Trump has claimed without evidence that as many as 5 million people voted illegally in the presidential election, complaining that the voter rolls include dead people, non-citizens and people registered in multiple states. He has called for an investigation. Election experts are more concerned about the age of the nation\\'s voting systems and their vulnerability to tampering. A federal commission responsible for working with states on those very issues is facing an uncertain future, after a House committee this week voted to eliminate it. The Election Assistance Commission was created after the \"hanging chad\" debacle in Florida during the 2000 presidential election. Republicans say the agency is a prime example of government waste. The commission is scheduled to make recommendations later this year on new standards for voting equipment. \"?This story has been corrected to show that the Iowa legislation would provide non-photo identification cards, not photo ones, to people who do not have a valid ID for voting purposes. \"?Cassidy reported from Atlanta.

       " ['Labor Secretary Nominee Addresses Conflicts of Interest nan President Donald Trump\\'s nominee for secretary of labor has proposed avoiding conflicts of interest by resigning as CEO of his fast food empire, selling off hundreds of holdings and recusing himself from government decisions in which he has a financial interest, according to his ethics filings with the government. \"I will not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter in which I know that I have a financial interest directly and predictably affected by the matter\" without a waiver from government ethics officials, Andrew Puzder wrote in the nine-page filing, dated Tuesday and obtained by The Associated Press. Puzder is CEO of CKE Restaurants Inc., which owns such chains as Hardee\\'s and Carl\\'s Jr. Asked on a separate Senate questionnaire obtained Thursday whether he would \"sever all connections with (his) present employer\" if confirmed, Puzder answered, \"Yes.\" A spokesperson for Tennessee GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander, whose committee will handle Puzder\\'s confirmation hearing, confirmed that the panel had received the agreement with the Office of Government Ethics required of all presidential Cabinet nominees. The hearing was set for Feb. 16. Democrats are questioning how well Puzder could advocate for American workers atop the agency charged with enforcing protections, given his business empire. They are publicizing several unflattering stories from current and former employees of Puzder\\'s company, and his hearing had been postponed several times. Despite the plan to divest, Puzder represents to them the face of corporations who aren\\'t giving workers their due. Trump, meanwhile, has not said he would divest from his business empire. Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer Thursday called on the administration and Puzder to withdraw his name from consideration \"before he further embarrasses this administration and further exposes the hypocrisy of President Trump.\" Puzder said on the questionnaire that from 2014 through 2016, he personally lobbied lawmakers and their staffers \"to advocate on behalf of issues that are of importance to the restaurant industry.\" Puzder cited his firm\\'s interest in menu labeling, franchise regulations, the Affordable Care Act and an Obama administration labor ruling that companies can be held responsible for labor violations committed by their contractors. Although not listed on the committee\\'s questionnaire, Congressional lobbying disclosures show that Puzder\\'s company, CKE Restaurant Holdings Inc., spent $220,000 on lobbyists who contacted legislators and federal officials on workplace, agriculture and franchise regulation issues. The fast food executive promised in his ethics agreement that he would sell off his CKE Restaurant Holdings partnership stock shares to his company. Puzder estimated the worth of those stock holdings at between $10 million and $50 million, according to his financial disclosures. Unlike the OGE-approved agreements of several other Trump Cabinet nominees, notably Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\\'s, Puzder\\'s does not include language that would place his sold-off holdings in a trust administered by an independent trustee. Such \"blind trusts\" are frequently used to wall off top federal officials from decisions made about their financial holdings. Instead, the government appears to be allowing Puzder to use an alternate route of insulating himself from his holdings by converting them into \"non-conflicting assets\" approved by ethics officials, such as government bonds or diversified mutual funds. Puzder said he was due a promised 2016 bonus, which he estimated in his disclosure to be worth between $1 million and $5 million, and said he hoped it would be paid \"before I assume the duties of the position of secretary.\" But Puzder said he would forfeit that bonus if his company did not pay it to him before he took office. Puzder\\'s agreement indicated that he sought extra time to sell off some of his assets and that government ethics officials gave him only cautious allowances to do so. Puzder said he expected to be able to sell more than 200 stocks, bonds and mutual fund holdings within 90 days but warned that more than a dozen other investment funds with multiple underlying assets could take longer to sell. Puzder said selling off those investment funds could take up to a half-year and his agreement indicated that Labor Department ethics officials might give him up to two months more but only if he shows \"substantial progress\" toward completing the divestiture of all of these entities within a half-year. Two of those complicated investment funds are vehicles run by Solamere Capital, an investment team headed by former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his son, Tagg. Puzder said he held up to $1 million in one of those funds, Solamere Capital Fund ll LLP. Puzder promised to work with government ethics officials \"to develop an effective recusal mechanism\" for any decisions affecting those corporate entities. The AP obtained the documents from a government official who was not authorized to release them before they are made public.'],\n",

Last week saw a surge in fighting between government forces and Russia-backed separatist rebels. The fighting, which killed more than 30 people, came amid concerns that President Donald Trump\\'s stated desire to improve relations with Russia could lead to lifting of U.S. sanctions against Russia connected to its interference in Ukraine. Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists Thursday that Russia wants the United States to pressure Ukraine to fulfill the terms of a two-year-old agreement on ending on the war and that the conflict \"can hardly be a subject for some kind of deal.\"'],\n",
       " ['Roberts, Judiciary\\'s Leader, Silent on Trump Criticism nan President Donald Trump\\'s unusually personal criticism of federal judges has drawn rebukes from many quarters, including from Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, but not much from the judges themselves. The leader of the federal judiciary, Chief Justice John Roberts, has himself been a target of Trump\\'s attacks. But Roberts has refused to comment on Trump\\'s remarks, including recent criticism of judges who are dealing with the president\\'s executive order on immigration. And that\\'s not likely to change, even if the tweeter in chief keeps up his attacks on judges. Bolstered by lifetime tenure, independent judges should not respond to criticism, no matter how harsh or that its source is the president, said a former judge, a law school dean and a constitutional law professor. Judges \"should basically give the tweets the attention they deserve, which means they should be ignored. This is basically a childish tantrum from someone who didn\\'t get his way. And the judiciary should go about its business and decide cases, including cases involving him,\" said Vanderbilt University law professor Suzanna Sherry. Trump\\'s style may be different and his language more coarse, but the comments themselves are not the \"threat to judicial independence that some commentators have made them out to be,\" said University of Pennsylvania law school dean Theodore Ruger. Former U.S. District Judge Paul Cassell said judges would find themselves in unfamiliar territory \"if they start critiquing the Twitter feed of the president.\" Among sitting judges who have commented in some way is Gorsuch, who has been meeting on Capitol Hill with senators who soon will consider whether to confirm him to the Supreme Court. On Wednesday, Gorsuch said he found the president\\'s attacks on the judiciary \"disheartening\" and \"demoralizing,\" according to Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. Trump took to Twitter to question the veracity of Blumenthal\\'s account, but Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., each confirmed that Gorsuch made similar comments to them. Sasse told MSNBC\\'s \"Morning Joe,\" \\'\\'Frankly, he got pretty passionate about it,\" said Sasse, adding that Gorsuch said any attack on the \"\\'brothers or sisters of the robe is an attack on all judges.\\'\" Former Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a Republican who is helping with Gorsuch\\'s confirmation and attended the Blumenthal meeting, issued a statement acknowledging that Gorsuch said he finds any criticism of a judge\\'s integrity and independence to be \"disheartening and demoralizing.\" But Ayotte said the nominee also made clear he was not referring to any specific comment. Also Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Dan Polster said during a speech in Cleveland that questioning the legitimacy of a federal judge is a line that shouldn\\'t be crossed. Polster, a nominee of President Bill Clinton, did not mention Trump by name, according to a report on Cleveland.com. Polster said that a public office holder who makes those types of comments \"calls into question his or her own legitimacy.\" Roberts was the first judge to incur Trump\\'s wrath. During the presidential campaign last winter, Trump called the chief justice \"an absolute disaster\" and \"disgraceful\" mainly for the two opinions Roberts wrote that preserved President Barack Obama\\'s health care overhaul. Next in Trump\\'s sights was U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who was presiding over fraud lawsuits against Trump University. In June, Trump called Curiel \"a hater of Donald Trump\" who couldn\\'t be fair to him because Curiel is \"of Mexican heritage\" and Trump had proposed building a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border. Last week, Trump called U.S. District Judge James Robart a \"so-called judge\" after Robart imposed a temporary halt on Trump\\'s executive order barring people from seven predominantly Muslim countries from coming to the United States. On Sunday, Trump renewed his Twitter attacks against Robart: \"Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!\" On Wednesday, he said the \"courts seem to be so political,\" in reference to the three federal appeals court judges who are considering the administration\\'s plea to enforce the order. Trump is not the first president to object to court decisions or to opine about how a court should rule, said Paul Collins, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Obama used his 2010 State of the Union message to assail the Supreme Court\\'s Citizens United campaign finance ruling, with several justices in the audience. Obama also delivered a lengthy pitch for his health care law while the court was weighing the case in 2015. With the exception of John F. Kennedy, every president since Dwight Eisenhower has been critical of some Supreme Court decisions, said Collins, drawing on research he did with co-author Matthew Eshbaugh-Soha of the University of North Texas. But past presidents did not make their displeasure known by \"attacking judges ... or by questioning the decision such that there\\'s a possibility of undermining faith in the judicial system,\" Collins said. \"I get this uncomfortable sense that the president may be trying to lower confidence in judges in anticipation of defying a ruling.\" Ruger said Roberts, as the head of the judicial branch of government, or another justice might feel compelled to speak up about the importance of an independent judiciary if the attacks continue. But Cassell, a law professor at the University of Utah who was a judge from 2002 to 2007, said Trump has the right to voice his disagreement. \"We live in an age now where, for better or for worse, the language we use is getting rougher in a variety of contexts,\" he said.'],\n",

EDF said the staff at the Flamanville plant in Normandy immediately brought the fire under control. The cause of the fire, in the machine room of the No. 1 reactor, was under investigation. The machine room, which houses turbines that produce electricity, is a non-nuclear area of the plant. There was no radiation leak as a result of the fire or blast, EDF said. Fire officers checked five of the plant\\'s workers to see if they were suffering from smoke inhalation but they did not require further medical attention, said Olivier Marmion, a regional official. Foul play was ruled out as a cause of the fire, with initial suspicions focusing on a possible electrical short-circuit, Marmion said. EDF said the plant\\'s No. 1 reactor was subsequently disconnected from the grid \"?a normal operating procedure in such circumstances. Flamanville has two 1,300-megawatt reactors, in operation since 1985 and 1986. Nearly 80 percent of France\\'s electricity production is generated from nuclear power.'],\n",
       " ['Russian Hackers Get Burned in Deal With Russia\\'s Spy Agency nan For several years a group of Russian hackers have been posting letters and documents stolen from senior Russian officials with impunity. And then the nation\\'s spy agency tracked them down and offered them a deal. A member of the Shaltai Boltai (Humpty Dumpty) group told The Associated Press on Thursday that the hackers accepted the offer from the Federal Security Service, or FSB, the top KGB successor agency: show their spoils before publishing in exchange for protection. But somehow the things went wrong for the group, and its leader and two other men have ended up behind bars. Alexander Glazastikov, who spoke to the AP from Tallinn, Estonia, where he\\'s seeking political asylum, said his group had no connection to the hacking of Democratic Party emails during the 2016 U.S. election campaign. Former President Barack Obama\\'s administration had accused Russia of launching the hacking campaign to help Republican Donald Trump win, accusations that the Kremlin has denied. \"We did not have any interest in Western countries, the United States. No one except inside Russia,\" Glazastikov said. He didn\\'t say if the FSB officers who approached the group were those arrested in December on charges of spying for the United States. The arrests reported by Russian media outlets fueled speculation that the officers could have been connected to hacking the Democrats. While the interview Thursday provided no new information about Russian meddling in the U.S. elections, it offered a rare glimpse into the shadowy world of Russian politics, where hackers serve as a weapon for competing Kremlin clans and rival spy agencies. Glazastikov said the hacking group\\'s leader, Vladimir Anikeyev, had offered to set up Shaltai Boltai as a resource that would release information serving public interests. Glazastikov said he joined the group because he was bored with his marketing job. The group quickly won the limelight by publishing letters written by government officials, artists or Kremlin-connected tycoons that cast them as unscrupulous and cynical. And then Shaltai Boltai began to cash in on its fame by blackmailing its victims to make them pay to prevent the publication of their personal data. Glazastikov said he believed the group crossed a red line for Russian officials in 2015, when it posted letters and documents from the chief of the Defense Ministry\\'s construction department and then followed up with an open letter to the head of military counterintelligence mocking the agency\\'s inability to keep secrets. \"We were playing with fire: The counterintelligence got very interested in us after that letter,\" Glazastikov said in an interview broadcast Thursday with the Russian Dozhd television station. He said unidentified people, possibly from the Defense Ministry, bought the cache of documents stolen from the military construction department chief for about $100,000. Separately, the FSB, competing for influence with other spy agencies, got the hacking group in its crosshairs. Glazastikov said that Dozhd Anikeyev, the hacking group\\'s leader, had told him the FSB contacted him via proxies to give a message: \"Guys, we know all about you. We won\\'t arrest you, but we would like to know what you are doing.\" Neither the Defense Ministry nor the FSB has had any immediate comment about Glazastikov\\'s claims. Glazastikov said Anikeyev was maintaining links to hackers who stole personal data and also dealing with the victims and those who ordered the hackings. Glazastikov estimated the group earned up to $2 million since 2014, but a large share of the money was spent to cover \"operational expenses.\" He said he himself made less than $100,000. Glazastikov said Anikeyev didn\\'t name the FSB officers he was dealing with, and added that he doesn\\'t know if they were the officers of the FSB\\'s cybercrime division arrested on treason charges in December. Two of them have been named in Russian media as Col. Sergei Mikhailov, deputy head of the FSB\\'s Information Security Center (TsIB), and his subordinate, Maj. Dmitry Dokuchayev. According to Russian media reports, Mikhailov was arrested in a way designed to sow fear in the ranks: He had a bag placed over his head while attending a meeting of senior FSB officials. Glazastikov said Anikeyev had asked him to come to Russia, but he refused because he had a feeling that Anikeyev had been arrested and was making the request on officials\\' orders. Another hacking group member, Konstantin Teplyakov, agreed to come and was arrested. Anikeyev\\'s arrest was later officially announced. Glazastikov said he didn\\'t know another alleged group member, Alexander Filinov, who also was arrested. Filinov showed up Thursday at a Moscow court, which extended his arrest until April. \"\\x94â\\x80?Isachenkov reported from Moscow.'],\n",

       " ['5 Key Moments From the Appeals Court Hearing on Trump\\'s Travel Ban nan Three judges from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals grilled lawyers for the Department of Justice and the state of Washington on Tuesday in an extraordinary hearing over Donald Trump\\'s executive order temporarily banning immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries. The case before the court centers on the Trump administration\\'s appeal of a nationwide temporary restraining order issued on Friday by U.S. District Court Judge James Robart in Seattle. The executive order also placed a 120-day hold on admitting any refugees to the U.S. and indefinitely blocked Syrian refugees from entering. The administration asserts that the restraining order is \"vastly overbroad\" and an improper judicial encroachment on the authority of the president. Thousands of people tuned in to listen to an audio live stream of the hearing. The judges have indicated that a ruling could come as soon as today. Arguing for DOJ was August Flentje, a special counsel to the assistant attorney general, civil division. Washington state\\'s solicitor general, Noah Purcell, presented the case for his state and Minnesota. Nearly 100 technology companies, as well as numerous civil rights groups and lawyers, filed amicus briefs with the court in support of Washington state. Hearing the case via telephone conference were Circuit Judge Michelle Friedland (appointed by President Barack Obama) in San Jose, California, who presided over the hearing; Senior Circuit Judge William C. Canby (appointed by President Jimmy Carter) in Phoenix; and Senior Circuit Judge Richard Clifton (appointed by President George W. Bush) in Honolulu. Here were the key moments from the hearing:  Arguing for the federal government that the executive order was \"well within the president\\'s power as delegated to him by Congress,\" Flentje soon found himself on the defensive as Friedland pressed for evidence the government relied on to determine the risks posed by immigrants from the seven countries affected by the executive order. \"Has the government pointed to any evidence connecting these countries with terrorism?\" she asked. \"These proceedings have been moving very fast,\" he replied, and cited decisions made during the Obama administration to restrict nationals of those seven countries from eligibility for a visa waiver program. \"And that is, I think, the strongest type of reliance, where the president is relying on Congress\\' determination that these are countries of concern.\" Chiming in, Canby pointed out that during last week\\'s hearing in Seattle, the federal government\\'s lawyer was unable to provide any examples of federal crimes committed in the U.S. by visa holders from the seven countries. \"Yes, your honor,\" Flentje answered. \"These proceedings have been moving quite fast, and we\\'re doing the best we can.\" He then offered an example of people from Somalia who were convicted in the United States of supporting Somali-based terrorist group al-Shabaab. \"Is that in the record?\" Friedland asked. \"Can you point us to where in the record you are referring\" \"It is not in the record,\" Flentje conceded.  Purcell argued that \"shocking evidence\" of Trump\\'s \"intent to discriminate against Muslims\" is proof that the travel ban is unconstitutional because it was motivated by religious discrimination. But he was repeatedly challenged on that assertion by Clifton, who pointed out that the executive order affects only a small percentage of Muslims worldwide. \"I have trouble understanding why we\\'re supposed to infer religious animus when, in fact, the vast majority of Muslims would not be affected,\" Clifton said. \"And where the concern for those connected with radical Islamic sects is kind of hard to deny.\" \"We\\'re not saying that this is a complete ban on Muslims entering the country,\" Purcell said, referring to the broad exclusionary policy Trump promoted early in his presidential campaign. \"We do not need to prove that this order harms only Muslims or that it harms every Muslim,\" Purcell continued. \"We just need to prove that it was motivated by a desire to harm Muslims.\"  Flentje was repeatedly asked by the judges if the president could explicitly bar all Muslims from entering the country without review by the judicial branch. \"Could the president say in the order, \\'We\\'re not going to let any Muslims in\\'?\" Canby asked. \"That\\'s not what the order does here,\" Flentje replied, avoiding a direct response. \"I know,\" Canby said. \"Could he do that?\" \"That\\'s not what the order does,\" Flentje answered twice more. As the hearing drew to a close, Flentje conceded, \"If there were an executive order that prevented the entry of Muslims, there would be people with standing to challenge that ... but that\\'s not the order we have here. This order is limited to the countries defined by Congress.\" \"But the allegations are that ... was the motivation,\" Friedland said. \"And plaintiffs have submitted evidence they suggest shows that was the motivation. So why shouldn\\'t the case proceed perhaps to discovery to see if that was really the motivation or not?\" \"We\\'re not saying the case shouldn\\'t proceed,\" Flentje said. \"But it is extraordinary for a court to enjoin the president\\'s national security determination based on some newspaper articles.\"  Purcell argued that the government\\'s shifting interpretations of the executive order led to even legal permanent U.S. residents\\' getting swept up in the chaotic first few days. \"They changed their minds about five times about whether it applies to those people in the time since the order issued, and now they say it doesn\\'t,\" Purcell said. And while White House counsel Don McGahn has since issued a memo to federal agencies stating that the ban does not apply to legal permanent residents, Purcell argued that until the administration changes the language of the order \"to make that crystal clear,\" the judges should not discount the possibility that the administration could again alter the enforcement of the ban. Clifton later raised concerns with Flentje about the legal authority of the White House counsel to instruct government departments about the meaning of the order. \"Why shouldn\\'t we look to the executive branch to more clearly define what the order means rather than looking through the lens of subsequent interpretations?\" Clifton asked. Flentje responded, \"The guidance from the White House counsel is the definitive interpretation of the order, and the White House counsel speaks for the president in this context.\"  Flentje argued that the temporary restraining order issued by Robart last week is too broad and that the plaintiff states have no standing to challenge the president\\'s authority to enforce provisions of the order affecting refugees and visa holders who have never before been admitted to the U.S. He argued that if the appeals court decides to allow the restraining order to remain in place, it should be modified to apply only to \"previously admitted aliens who are temporarily abroad now or who wish to travel and return to the United States in the future,\" he said. But Purcell argued that limiting the restraining order in that way \"would not remedy the [executive] order\\'s violation\" of the establishment clause in the Constitution \"by favoring one religious group over another.\"'],\n",

Though Dannielynn never really knew her mom, her father, Larry Birkhead, said she reminds him of Smith more and more every day. \"she is fearless like her mom. She\\'ll get on any roller coaster that you put in front of her,\"?Birkhead, told ABC News \"?0/20\"?in an exclusive interview. \"I could stand right next to my daughter and we could look like twins, and the first thing they\\'ll say is ... \"Spitting image of the mother.\"?Watch the full story on ABC News \"20/20\" on Friday, Feb. 10 at 10 p.m. ET   Smith, a reality TV star and former Playboy Playmate of the Year who struggled with prescription drugs, was found dead in a Florida hotel room on Feb. 8, 2007. After an extensive investigation, the official cause of death was ruled an accidental overdose -- Smith had nine different prescription drugs in her system. She was 39. Dannielynn was just 5 months old at the time. \"Anna always wanted a little girl, that was her dream,\"?Birkhead said. \"she went from city to city, as far back [as] the \\'90s, and she would collect outfits from all these road trips \"?and hope that one day that she could dress her in all these frilly outfits.\"?  As their daughter has gotten older, Birkhead, a photographer, said he has tried to explain what happened to her mother. \"the way I\\'ve told Dannielynn in the past is that, \"\\x98Your mom took some medicines and she ... might not [have] taken them correctly or the right way, and the doctors couldn\\'t help her, and they tried,\" he said. Birkhead had a romantic relationship with Smith but ended up going to court in an epic custody battle for Dannielynn until a paternity test proved Birkhead was the father. Smith\\'s personal attorney, Howard K. Stern, and several other men had also claimed to be the baby\\'s father. The case made international headlines. But Birkhead said Stern has \"been supportive\"?of him as a father from the moment he won custody of Dannielynn. \"He just said, \\'Look, you\\'re got to get strong. you\\'re got to be there for Dannielynn,\\'\"?Birkhead said. \"the minute after the paternity test was over ... he\\'s helping me change Dannielynn\\'s diaper, [showing me], \"This is how you feed her,\"?\"?it\\'s been nonstop since then.\"?    Birkhead said he\\'s tried to give their daughter a stable life away from the spotlight. The two live just outside of Louisville, Kentucky, but Birkhead said even being thousands of miles away from Hollywood hasn\"t stopped all the questions that can come with fame. \"people think [Dannielynn] has got millions and millions of dollars,\"?he said. \"she came home and asked me where the money was, and I said, \"I\\'l still looking for it.\"?Attorneys for Smith\\'s estate were locked in a complicated legal battle for nearly 20 years with attorneys for the estate of her late husband, Texas billionaire oil tycoon J. Howard Marshall II.   Smith was just 24 years old when she married Marshall, who was 89 at the time, in 1994. When he died the following year, he left his estate, valued by some estimates to be worth $1.6 billion, to his son, E. Pierce Marshall, and nothing to Smith. For the next nearly 20 years, Smith\\'s legal team made numerous attempts to have the courts overturn Marshall\\'s will and claim money from his estate. The case even made it to the U.S. Supreme Court twice. In 2013, it seemed Dannielynn could inherit as much as $49 million in damages from Marshall\\'s estate after a California judge\\'s ruling, but the ruling was later overturned and Dannielynn was denied inheritance from his estate. \"If Dannielynn is to inherit anything via her mom that she was entitled to, so be it, but it\\'s not like we\\'r sitting around waiting for one thing to happen,\"?Birkhead said.   Birkhead said they receive no support from Smith\\'s estate and that he makes a living through photography and flipping houses. The single dad said he is determined to ensure that Dannielynn has a very different life than her mom. \"It\\'s just like any other kid who has lost a celebrity parent. They think that the child is automatically destined for the same path,\"?he said. \"\\x9c[But] she can work me like her mom could work people. She gets what she wants.\"?,-1\"'],\n",
       " ['Japanese Prime Minister to Meet With Trump at White House, Mar-a-Lago nan Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is set to meet with President Donald Trump Friday, becoming the second world leader to meet with Trump at the White House since his inauguration. The Prime Minister will be accompanied by Finance Minister Taro Aso and Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida. Abe is expected to unveil an economic proposal to invest $150 billion in U.S. infrastructure projects, according to the Japanese newspaper The Asahi Shibun, which reported on details of the draft proposal released earlier this month. The proposal, which includes plans for high-speed railway systems in Texas and California, could create 700,000 jobs in the U.S. Following meetings in Washington that will likely focus on defense and economic cooperation, Abe and his wife, Akie Abe, will fly to Trump\\'s \"Winter White House,\" the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, for weekend golfing. Abe gifted Trump a high-end golf driver when the pair met at Trump Tower in New York last November. Japan, one of the closest U.S. allies, has already become a focal point for the new administration. Secretary of Defense James Mattis visited South Korea and Japan on his first official foreign trip in his new post, highlighting the Pacific region\\'s importance to U.S. security interests. Mattis reaffirmed to Abe the U.S. commitment to the mutual defense treaty with Japan, especially in the wake of North Korea aggression, according to a Pentagon statement on their meeting.     In addition to defense cooperation, one of the most important topics of conversation between Trump and Abe will undoubtedly be some sort of bilateral trade agreement. In his first days in office, Trump signed an executive order withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), much to Japan\\'s dismay. Abe has said he will appeal that decision to the new administration, but has also signaled openness toward constructing a Japan-U.S. free trade agreement or an economic partnership agreement. According to a White House statement on the Jan. 28 call between Trump and Abe, the pair is \"committed to deepen the bilateral trade and investment relationship.\"   News of America\\'s withdrawal from the TPP drew concern from partners in the region who had seen the trade pact as a check on China\\'s economic and geopolitical influence. Without U.S. participation in the deal, China is free to work its own trade pacts or push an alternative regional treaty that does not include the U.S. In crafting a trade deal between the U.S. and Japan, expect vehicle sales to be a key issue. Trump complained on Jan. 23 that Japan does \"things to us that make it impossible to sell cars in Japan, and yet, they sell cars [in the U.S.] and they come in like by the hundreds of thousands on the biggest ships I\"ve ever seen.\" According to Bloomberg, Japan exported 1.6 million vehicles to the U.S. in 2015, while the U.S. sold less than 19,000 to Japan, helping to account for the fact that the country has the fourth-largest trade surplus with the US. Japan\\'s trade minister Hiroshinge Seko responded to Trump, saying that Japan does not apply tariffs to US cars and he wants to \"explain this to the U.S. side.\" Instead of tariffs, some attribute the severe trade imbalance to a perception by Japanese consumers that U.S. vehicles have poor quality. \"I wouldn\"t mind driving American cars if they didn\"t need maintenance for a year,\" said Kunihiko Miyake, a former diplomat who is now a visiting professor at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, told Bloomberg. \"Cost-performance-wise, American cars are not good. That\\'s why I don\"t buy them, not because of the non-tariff barriers.\" ABC News\\' Anthony Trotter and Luis Martinez contributed to this report.'],\n",
       " ['The Story Behind the Arcane Senate Rule Used to Silence Elizabeth Warren nan The dramatic episode Tuesday night, during which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell silenced Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren\\'s speech against attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions, shone a light on an arcane Senate statute: Rule 19. McConnell, R-Ky., accused the Massachusetts senator of violating a provision in the rule that states \"no Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator.\"?He claimed that her quoting various 1986 statements from other people on Sen. Sessions -- including the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, who called the Alabama Republican a \"disgrace,\"?and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\\'s widow, Coretta Scott King, who wrote that Sessions \"Chill[ed] the free exercise of the vote by black citizens\"?-- was a violation of that provision of the obscure Senate rule, forcing the ultimate rebuke in the Senate floor: to stop talking and sit down.  The rule, which former Senate parliamentarian Alan Frumin said he referred to as the \"shut up and sit down rule,\"?addresses various aspects of Senate debate decorum, including a requirement that the presiding officer first recognize a senator who wishes to speak before he or she can do so. The Senate added Section 2 of Rule 19, which pertains to speaking ill of another sitting senator, in 1902, in response to a literal fistfight that broke out on the Senate floor. Then-Sen. John McLaurin of South Carolina raced into the Senate chamber and claimed that fellow South Carolinian Sen. Ben Tillman had told a \"willful, malicious and deliberate lie\"?about him, according to research from the Senate Historical Office and author Francis Butler Simkins. The \"lie\"?in question was about Tillman\\'s criticizing McLaurin for moving closer to the opposing party. Tillman apparently heard the comment, turned around and punched McLaurin \"squarely in the jaw,\"?according to the Senate Historical Office. Six days later, the Senate censured both men and added what is now Section 2 to Rule 19.  It is up to the presiding officer to flag such language and, typically, remind senators of the rule and their potential violation of it before they move to officially censor him or her, according to Frumin, who served 18 years as chief Senate parliamentarian. For example, Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., who was acting as the presiding officer Tuesday night when Warren was censured, warned her as she was quoting Kennedy that she might be violating the rule, before officially censuring her after she moved on to quoting King. \"When [Warren] quoted Sen. Kennedy she was warned,\"?Frumin said. \"And I think that that\\'s perfectly appropriate. That\\'s a proper way for this to take place.\"?The parliamentarian can help the presiding officer make his or her decision about whether to officially accuse a senator of violating it but, Frumin said, it\\'s completely up to the presiding officer to decide whether to officially \"Call to order\"?the senator found in violation of Rule 19. For his part, Daines, the presiding officer whose regular \"shifts\"?in that role include 6:30 pm to 8 pm on Tuesdays, said his decision to invoke Rule 19 had nothing to do with politics. \"Given the Senate is the world\\'s greatest deliberative body,\"?he told ABC News today, \"I believe we should have civilized debate.\"? The short answer is very rarely. One instance widely reported today was in 1979, when then-Sen. Lowell Weicker, R-Conn., called Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., an \"idiot\"?and \"devious\"?in a Senate debate, which Majority Leader Robert Byrd sought to defuse with a handshake. Frumin said that when he served as parliamentarian, he sought to first allow senators to work out such issues themselves without getting the Senate rulebook involved. \"I would do backflips to avoid enforcing the rule,\"?he said, adding that he would do everything he could to \"lower the temperature\"?in the room before the presiding officer resorted to Rule 19.'],\n",
       " ['Trump brand too hot to handle Timothy Calkins is clinical professor of marketing at Northwestern University\\'s Kellogg School of Management and the author of \"Defending Your Brand: How Smart Companies Use Defensive Strategy to Deal with Competitive Attacks.\" The views expressed here are his. All of this is not good for the Trump brand, which only two years ago was synonymous for many with success, luxury, wealth, and elegance -- so much so that his children had successfully leveraged it to foster ventures in the wine and fashion industries. Wearing a Trump branded suit made a statement. The brand didn\\'t appeal to everyone, but it had a generally positive association. Today, however, the brand has a completely different meaning. It makes a very different statement, with associations of racism, sexism and xenophobia. And now that statement is blowing back onto the Trump children\\'s businesses too. Given the polarizing nature of the Trump brand, Nordstrom\\'s decision last week to drop the Ivanka Trump line shouldn\\'t come as a surprise. It\\'s a reflection of the state of the whole Trump brand today. Nordstrom claims that the decision was driven purely by sales results. A company spokesperson explained the move, noting, \"Each year we cut about 10 percent and refresh our assortment with about the same amount. In this case, based on the brand\\'s performance we\\'ve decided not to buy it for this season.\" I suspect Nordstrom\\'s decision was a bit more complex, and that ultimately both results and branding played a role in phasing out the line. The Trump brand currently is so polarizing that Nordstrom was probably eager to drop it. The brand is too hot to handle. Nordstrom doesn\\'t want to be seen as supporting the new administration strongly, a wise move given that some people intensely dislike the Trump brand. On the other hand, Nordstrom doesn\\'t want to be opposed to the Trump brand either. It is never smart to publicly provoke a president. It is a very delicate balance, made all the harder when selling the line of products. By dropping the Trump brand due to sales trends, Nordstrom was simply attempting to back away from a conflict. Of course, things are rarely simple when dealing with Donald Trump. He attacked Nordstrom on Twitter, writing \"My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person ... terrible!\" Donald Trump is not the first president to defend his family. Back in 1950, music critic Paul Hume wrote a negative review of performance by President Harry Truman\\'s daughter. Truman sent off a frosty letter on White House stationary: \"Someday I hope to meet you. When that happens, you\\'ll need a new nose, a lot of beefsteak for black eyes.\" Still, Trump\\'s habit of criticizing individuals and companies such as Nordstrom on social media raises the stakes for brand leaders. It\\'s worth dwelling on the flap between President Trump (as a father and a businessman) and Nordstrom, because more brands are following Nordstrom\\'s lead. Most firms want to be politically neutral -- there is no reason to side with one party or the other and risk turning away customers. As Nordstrom noted in a November Twitter post, \"We hope that offering a vendor\\'s products isn\\'t misunderstood as us taking a political position.\" Unfortunately, with the Trump brand, it is seen that way. Supporting Trump in any fashion is making a statement. All of this means that the Trump brand, including the Ivanka Trump line, will have a challenging time going forward. For the Trump brand team, there are two keys for success with the Donald in the White House. First, plan for a soft year. Assume sales will drop, so manage expectations down. Proactively make moves that might logically explain a sales drop, and scale back and conserve resources. Second, work to reduce polarization. The Trump brand will rebound if it can get some early wins and become more broadly appealing. For retailers and licensees, it will be important not to be seen as taking a stand on the Trump brand. In most cases, this means just backing away from ties. The goal is not to be against Trump -- this can result in a Twitter attack from the President, which is not desirable (as Nordstrom experienced). The idea is to just not be seen as a supporter. With retailers such as Nordstrom abandoning the Trump brand, it is clear that a repositioning is in order. Until then, most brands will keep a safe distance away.'],\n",
       " ['Why Trump seeks to scare where other presidents soothed Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump, concerned his travel ban could be stopped cold in the judicial branch after a less-than-stellar rollout, is leaning into fear, attempting to ratchet up terror concerns by telling audiences that he has learned considerably more about terror since taking office last month. Trump and his top aides are well aware that his travel ban would benefit from public approval, so Trump made the case Wednesday that he knows more about terrorism than most. He suggested that Americans -- at least those who don\\'t get classified briefings -- don\\'t understand the terror threat against the United States. \"Terrorism is a tremendous threat, far greater than people in our country understand,\" Trump told a gathering of sheriffs in a Washington hotel. Seemingly hinting at information gleaned from his classified briefings, the President added: \"Believe me. I\\'ve learned a lot in the last two weeks, and terrorism is a far greater threat than the people of our country understand.\" Ari Fleischer, who served as Bush\\'s White House press secretary during 9/11, said all presidents use \"realistic, worse-case scenarios\" to push their agendas. He cautioned the tactic could be abused and result in undermining an administration. \"Like anything, you can go too far. You can exaggerate, you can get facts wrong, you can hype it to a degree where you lose credibility,\" he said. \"But it is been a time honored tradition in American politics to use a worst-case scenario to drive an agenda.\" It\\'s also a tactic that\\'s worked for Trump. Throughout the 2016 campaign, Trump urged his supporters to worry about terror and pushed them to do so by painting the world as an increasingly dangerous place. \"People are scared,\" Trump said in his June Republican National Convention acceptance speech. \"The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.\" More Americans said terrorism was a pressing concern in 2016 than any point since 2003. According to a CNN poll released in 2016, 71% of Americans said further acts of terrorism are very or somewhat likely in the United States over the next several weeks, a number that has not been that high since March 2003. The strategy Trump\\'s strategy as President is twofold. Alarmist language could help sell the travel ban to a skeptical public. Trump is also suggesting he knows more about the need for the ban than the judges overseeing the legal challenges, who are not privy to confidential briefings. Americans are largely split on Trump\\'s executive order, which bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the US for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days and indefinitely halts refugees from Syria. Voters generally disapprove of key aspects of Trump\\'s order, according to a Quinnipiac University poll out Wednesday. It found 51% of the public oppose suspending travel to the US for 90 days from seven countries, 60% oppose suspending all refugee immigration for 120 days and 70% oppose indefinitely suspending the Syrian refugee program. Trump\\'s order went before a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals three-judge panel on Tuesday where lawyers from Trump\\'s Justice Department squared up against the states of Washington and Minnesota. The court is expected to rule on Trump\\'s order by the end of the week. The President knocked the arguments against his travel ban Wednesday, telling the same group of sheriffs that \"even a \\'bad high school student\\' \" could understand the language of his order and find in his favor. Words of reassurance In contrast, after high-profile attacks in San Bernardino and Paris, President Barack Obama said: \"the threat from terrorism is real, but we will overcome it.\" \"Let\\'s be vigilant, but not afraid,\" Obama said in his final speech as President. \"(ISIS) will try to kill innocent people. But they cannot defeat America unless we betray our Constitution and our principles in the fight.\" Even George W. Bush, whose administration did, at times, stoke fear in the run up to the Iraq War and around homeland security, was measured in the face of the 9/11 attacks. \"Now, the American people have got to go about their business. We cannot let the terrorists achieve the objective of frightening our nation to the point where we don\\'t conduct business, where people don\\'t shop,\" Bush said after 9/11, the deadliest terrorist attack in US history. Bush, in his final speech as president, said the United States was a nation \"that inspires immigrants to risk everything for the dream of freedom.\" \"This is a nation where citizens show calm in times of danger, and compassion in the face of suffering,\" he said. A good example of Bush using fear: His push to establish the Department of Homeland Security in 2003. At the time, Fleischer said, Bush would regularly read his morning \"threat matrix\" -- a document about produced by the Department of Homeland Security on possible threats -- and use it publicly at times to push his plan to fight terrorism. \"With a vast nation to defend, we can neither predict nor prevent every conceivable attack,\" Bush said before establishing the new government agency. \"And in a free and open society, no department of government can completely guarantee our safety against ruthless killers, who move and plot in shadows. Yet our government will take every possible measure to safeguard our country and our people.\"'],\n",
       " ['Washington\\'s new lows Washington (CNN)Washington has never been this bad. It\\'s a refrain passed through history as successive generations bemoan the spite, division and dysfunction that defines their own political age. But as Donald Trump\\'s presidency staggers to life, intense discord and fury are battering the capital. Capitol Hill is still reverberating from its latest political earthquake -- Tuesday night\\'s startling vote by GOP senators to shut down Democrat Elizabeth Warren and prevent her from speaking on the floor for a debate over the confirmation of Sen. Jeff Sessions as attorney general. In a controversy laced with race and gender, Warren was censured by the GOP majority for reading a letter written by Coretta Scott King, widow of Martin Luther King Jr., opposing Sessions\\' nomination to a federal judgeship three decades ago. The incident became an instant political firestorm in a capital still getting used to Trump\\'s young administration. But more fundamentally, the dispute underscored the profound -- and personal -- anger flowing through Washington in the aftermath of last year\\'s election and reflects a nation torn in half by bitter political divides. Silencing Elizabeth Warren backfires on Senate GOP With the Senate poisoned, the House in the grip of a zealous GOP majority and a new president who only knows one political strategy -- all-out personal attack -- there is every reason to think the animosity will continue to boil. Some seasoned Washington observers are starting to believe that for once, Beltway nastiness really has hit a historic nadir. \"It has very seldom been worse,\" said Steven Smith, a congressional expert who wrote the 2014 book \"The Senate Syndrome\" about what he considers a period of rising parliamentary warfare in the chamber. There have, of course, been dark moments in Washington\\'s legislative corridors, including a brutal beating of a Massachusetts senator in the Senate chamber several years before the Civil War after he delivered a blistering attack on slavery. \"But it\\'s hard to imagine a time when for actually year after year it has been so intensely partisan as it has been,\" said Smith, a professor at Washington University, St Louis. Trent Lott, the former Republican Senate majority leader, co-authored the book \"Crisis Point\" last year with former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle that warned congressional polarization was making governing impossible. He cautioned against overreacting to the current turmoil while admitting the antagonism in Washington is at dispiriting levels. \"I have been in this city now approaching 50 years. I came here in 1968. When I got to Washington, there were machine guns on the steps of the Capitol,\" Lott said in an interview. During that tumultuous period, he said, the protests of the Vietnam War era and later the trauma of the Watergate scandal were moments when politics appeared to be careening off the rails. But he added: \"I must admit that it\\'s probably as rough right now as I have seen it in years in the Senate.\" Americans delivering a verdict Americans are already delivering a verdict on their current leaders. Congress\\' job approval rating regularly dips below 20% over its apparent inability to get anything done. And Trump took office as the most unpopular new president since polling began. The Warren imbroglio was just the latest eruption of bitterness on Capitol Hill in recent months. Last June, for instance, civil rights hero Rep. John Lewis led a sit-in in the House as Democratic fury erupted when Republicans refused to allow a vote on gun control measures. Warren\\'s moment galvanizes the left More recently, Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch dismissed arguments against Treasury Secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin as \"stupid.\" That was a striking choice of words from one of the most gentlemanly senators. Last month, Democrats boycotted hearings for several Trump nominees, prompting Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to say it was time for them to \"get over\" the fact they lost the election. And last week, Democratic Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota took a rhetorical swing at Texas Sen. Ted Cruz during a committee hearing when Cruz was not in the room, earning a rebuke from Republican Sen. John Cornyn, who called his charge \"untoward and inappropriate.\" In one of the more symbolic jabs, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer voted against McConnell\\'s wife, Elaine Chao, in her confirmation vote to become transportation secretary. Such spats might not get a second look in many walks of life. But they are extraordinary in the Senate, which prides itself on a level of decorum that seems anachronistic in the modern age. What is so notable about the recent political ugliness is not that it reveals political differences. It\\'s the personal nature of the affronts that seems new. Former Sen. Ted Kaufman, who spent decades working for then-Sen. Joe Biden and succeeded him as Delaware senator, says the mood in Washington has deteriorated since he left the chamber in 2009. He lays a hefty share of blame for the hyper partisanship cleaving Washington at the feet of the new President. \"The President is to this day the moral leader of the country,\" Kaufman said, warning that Trump\\'s propensity to personally attack his opponents would lower the tone further in the wider political debate. \"It is going to become okay not just in the Senate but throughout the country.\" Something quintessential is being lost The sour personal interaction on the Hill has some senators worried that something quintessential is being lost in the chamber even as they often blame the other side for the worst transgressions. \"I\\'m always worried about the breakdown in civility,\" said Sen. Tom Udall, whose father and uncle were congressmen and whose cousin was also a senator. \"I come from a family where my father and my uncle were champions of civility, of building consensus and I hate all of this.\" Republican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi blamed the discord on a demoralized Democratic Party. The epic showdown over presidential power and American identity \"I\\'ve never seen the losing party in a national election exhibit this level of disappointment,\" he told CNN. Democrats would counter that their candidate, Hillary Clinton, easily won the popular vote in the presidential election and that Trump has shattered most conventions on how presidents should behave. Trump won the White House with an abrasive promise to incite disruption and to destroy the political elites he blames for what he sees as a national crisis. So he\\'s unlikely to be a peacemaker. Trump lambasted Washington lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in his searing inaugural address on January 20. \"We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action -- constantly complaining but never doing anything about it,\" he said. Hardly serene before Trump But to blame the new president entirely for the dysfunction would be unfair. Washington was hardly serene before Trump\\'s arrival on the scene. Smith believes the combination of emboldened party leaders, a more partisan political environment fanned by outside influences on lawmakers and the growing homogeneity of political parties that has seen cross-party coalitions disappear have added up to a moment of fevered confrontation on Capitol Hill. \"Really over three or four decades the two parties in the Senate have engaged in an intensifying parliamentary war. It involves minority obstruction to majority action on legislation,\" he said. \"And it involves the majority response that means cracking down on the minority whenever it can.\" And there\\'s every indication the mood is going to get a lot worse. In recent months, simmering fury on Capitol Hill was exacerbated by the GOP\\'s refusal to even give a hearing to Judge Merrick Garland, former President Barack Obama\\'s pick for the Supreme Court. The impasse leave Democrats in no mood to help speed the path of Trump\\'s pick for the same seat, Neil Gorsuch. Now the GOP is considering the \"nuclear option\" -- a rules change that would incite Democratic incandescence -- to beat a possible filibuster with only Republican votes. Democrats, under pressure pressure from liberals who have experienced a political awakening since Trump\\'s election, are also in a mood for revenge, believing the GOP handcuffed Obama\\'s presidency with endless obstruction. And they believe the administration is rushing through some of the most controversial Cabinet nominees in recent history and thwarting their attempts to fully scrutinize them. Absent some kind of partisan realignment in the years to come, it seems unlikely that this generation of Washington politicians will be the last to lament the partisan swamp in which they swim.'],\n",
       " ['Trump falsely accuses senator of misrepresenting Gorsuch criticism Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump falsely accused a Democratic senator Thursday of misrepresenting his Supreme Court nominee\\'s words, according to several familiar with the incident. Sen. Richard Blumenthal said Wednesday that Judge Neil Gorsuch, Trump\\'s nominee, told him he found Trump\\'s attack on a federal judge on Twitter \"disheartening\" and \"demoralizing.\" Within a half-hour, Gorsuch spokesman Ron Bonjean, who was tapped by the White House to head communications for Gorsuch, confirmed that the nominee, Gorsuch, used those words in his meeting with Blumenthal. Several other senators, including Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, later relayed similar accounts of Gorsuch forcefully criticizing Trump\\'s public attacks on the judiciary branch. Supreme Court nominee Gorsuch calls Trump\\'s tweets \\'disheartening\\' And on Thursday, Blumenthal said on MSNBC Gorsuch specifically told him he \"should feel free to mention what I said about these attacks being disheartening and demoralizing.\" But none of that stopped Trump from firing off a shot against Blumenthal -- and at the same time raising questions about the coherence of the White House\\'s messaging. Supreme Court nominee Gorsuch calls Trump\\'s tweets \\'disheartening\\' \"Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who never fought in Vietnam when he said for years he had (major lie), now misrepresents what Judge Gorsuch told him?\" Trump tweeted Thursday morning. Gorsuch\\'s criticism came in response to Trump\\'s recent criticism of federal judges who have ruled against his immigration ban or appear poised to do so, in particular in reference to one of the President\\'s tweets slamming one of those judges as a \"so-called judge.\" \"The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!\" Trump tweeted last Saturday. On Wednesday, Trump pressed forward with his criticism, arguing that the judiciary has become too political and suggesting that judges on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals might rule against his appeal to reverse a temporary stay on implementing his travel ban because of political considerations, instead of the law. Blumenthal stood by his accounting of Gorsuch\\'s comments, telling CNN\\'s Chris Cuomo on \"New Day\" Thursday morning he \"absolutely and accurately\" stated what Gorsuch told him. \"I think that the President needs to hear from Judge Gorsuch about exactly what he is saying to myself and Senate colleagues,\" Blumenthal said. \"Maybe he simply hasn\\'t been informed and that\\'s the reason for his tweet.\" Former GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who is helping shepherd Gorsuch\\'s nomination on the Hill said in a statement Thursday Gorsuch has told senators \"he finds any criticism of a judge\\'s integrity and independence disheartening and demoralizing.\" Ayotte added the judge has made clear he \"could not comment on any specific cases and that judicial ethics prevent him from commenting on political matters.\" Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska also confirmed Thursday that Gorsuch criticized Trump\\'s attacks on the federal judge in a meeting with him as well. Sasse said Gorsuch \"got pretty passionate\" about the topic, particularly when he asked Gorsuch about Trump\\'s \"so-called judge\" tweet. \"This is a guy who welled up with some energy. He said any attack on any brothers or sisters of the robe is an attack on all judges. He believes in an an independent judiciary,\" Sasse said Thursday morning on MSNBC. Military service Trump\\'s dig at Blumenthal\\'s military service is a reference to Blumenthal\\'s past misrepresentations about his service during the Vietnam era. Blumenthal obtained multiple military deferments to avoid getting drafted into the Vietnam War and ultimately landed in the Marine Corps Reserve and never deployed to Vietnam, though he claimed multiple times he had served in Vietnam. Blumenthal apologized for misrepresenting his service in 2010. While Blumenthal enlisted in the Marine Reserve after multiple deferments, Trump -- who was also eligible for the draft during the Vietnam War -- never enlisted, instead obtaining multiple student deferments and ultimately a medical deferment for a bone spur to avoid the military draft. Democrats and Gorsuch Sen. Chris Coons said in his personal meeting with Gorsuch, he plans to ask the nominee about his commitment to judicial independence given some of the President\\'s recent comments about judges. \"I don\\'t think it\\'s constructive for President Trump to weigh in on this and to level accusations against sitting senators,\" the Delaware Democrat told CNN\\'s Alisyn Camerota on \"New Day.\" \"I frankly think the more he stays out of this the better for his judicial nominee.\" \"But this simply highlights why judicial independence is going to be so important for me and for other Senators as we go through the process of meeting Judge Gorsuch and considering whether or not he should serve on the Supreme Court,\" he added. Trump\\'s Thursday tweet could complicate the upcoming hearings for Gorsuch, who is certain to face questions about Trump\\'s tweets from Democrats. Liberals, already concerned with Gorsuch\\'s record, have also asked how he will demonstrate independence from the President. The President is also set to meet with red state Democrats for lunch, in hopes of wooing their support for Gorsuch.

       " ['Mother deported in Arizona immigration case that sparked protests (CNN)[Breaking news at 1:24 p.m.] Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, a mother of two in Arizona, has been deported to her native Mexico, Carlos Garcia, director of the advocacy organization Puente Arizona, said Thursday. Garcia de Rayos was taken into custody Wednesday and ordered to be deported during her yearly check-in with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Phoenix. Immigration officials said she was detained \"based on a removal order issued by the Department of Justice\\'s Executive Office for Immigration Review which became final in May 2013.\" [Original story, published 11:39 a.m.] Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, a mother of two, said a prayer before her yearly check-in with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Phoenix. But her meeting Wednesday with immigration officials ended differently than others over the last eight years: She was taken into custody and ordered to be deported. \"Lupita has been doing yearly check-ins with ICE and nothing happened,\" said Lucy Sandoval, an activist who has been working with Garcia de Rayos\\' family. \"But this is a different time.\" Immigration advocates said they believe the woman\\'s detention reflects the Trump administration\\'s hard line on illegal immigration. She could be the first Arizonan to be deported under President Donald Trump\\'s new executive order focused on removing undocumented immigrants with a history of arrests, Garcia\\'s attorney told CNN affiliate KNXV-TV. Any undocumented immigrant convicted or simply charged with a crime who hasn\\'t been adjudicated could be deported under a new Trump administration policy announced last month. Under the Obama administration, only undocumented immigrants convicted of a felony, serious misdemeanor or multiple misdemeanors were considered priorities for deportation. In 2008, Garcia de Rayos was arrested in a workplace raid, convicted of felony impersonation and served six months in ICE detention before being released later that year, according to CNN affiliate KPHO/KTVK-TV. Originally from Mexico, she was in the country illegally. Immigration officials said she was detained \"based on a removal order issued by the Department of Justice\\'s Executive Office for Immigration Review which became final in May 2013.\" \"Relevant databases indicate Ms. Garcia De Rayos has a prior felony conviction dating from March 2009 for criminal impersonation,\" the ICE statement said. Activists said the woman\\'s conviction stemmed from a false Social Security card she used for employment. \\'She wanted to confront this\\' Garcia de Rayos prayed before her meeting Wednesday with ICE, Sandoval said. Activists warned her of the possibility of her detention and offered her sanctuary, but she decided to show up, Sandoval said. \"She wanted to confront this,\" the activist said. \"She was brave. ... She\\'s a woman of faith. Yes, they were praying. They were hopeful that there would be some consciousness and some heart.\" On Wednesday evening, seven people were arrested outside the Phoenix ICE office when protesters attempted to block an agency van from taking Garcia de Rayos away. It was unclear if she was to be deported immediately or if she would be held at a detention center. Wednesday\\'s protests were mostly peaceful, but police said on Twitter that \"despite repeated warnings, some engaging in criminal acts\" refused to stop. Garcia de Rayos\\' husband and teenage children joined the protesters outside ICE headquarters. Asked what she would ask Trump if she could, Garcia de Rayos\\' daughter Jaqueline told KNXV: \"I\\'d ask him, \\'Why he would want to take her from me?\\' She hasn\\'t done anything wrong and I\\'m not scared of him.\" Rights group blames Arpaio\\'s crackdown Immigrant rights group Puente Arizona said that Garcia de Rayos is a victim of the policies of former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Enforcing identity theft laws was one of Arpaio\\'s most well-known tools to crack down on illegal immigration in the border state. Puente sued Arpaio, saying the workplace raids -- such as the one where Garcia was arrested nine years ago for using a fake Social Security number -- were unconstitutional and amounted to racial and ethnic profiling. It lost the case on appeal, but Arpaio disbanded the task force that conducted the raids. A crackdown on illegal immigration The immigration executive orders signed by Trump could amount to a vast expansion of authority for individual immigration officers and a dramatic increase in efforts to detain and deport undocumented immigrants. The order lays out a series of categories of undocumented immigrants that immigration law enforcement officials should prioritize for removing from the country, a reaction to what was criticized by the right as lax enforcement of immigration law by President Barack Obama. The Obama administration had prioritized expulsion of undocumented immigrants who threatened public safety or national security, had ties to criminal gang activity, committed serious felony offenses or were habitual misdemeanor criminal offenders. Trump\\'s order goes far beyond that, using a sweeping definition of \"criminal\" and giving a single immigration officer the ability to make judgments on threats to public safety. The order says the priority will be removing deportable immigrants who \"have been convicted of any criminal offense; have been charged with any criminal offense, where such charge has not been resolved; have committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense; have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency; have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits; are subject to a final order of removal, but who have not complied with their legal obligation to depart the United States; or in the judgment of an immigration officer, otherwise pose a risk to public safety or national security.\"'],\n",
       " ['Venezuela may have given passports to people with ties to terrorism Click here to read this article in Spanish/Lee este art¨ªculo en espa?ol That\\'s because the former legal adviser to the Venezuelan Embassy in Iraq is revealing secrets he says his government doesn\\'t want disclosed. \"I\\'m concerned about my safety and my family\\'s safety everywhere I go,\" Lopez said as he walked the cobble-stoned streets of Toledo. Lopez, 41, says he reported what he says was a scheme to sell passports and visas for thousands of dollars out of the embassy and repeatedly turned down offers to get a cut of the money. But it was the response from his government -- which has denied his allegations -- that surprised him the most. CNN and CNN en Espa?ol teamed up in a year-long joint investigation that uncovered serious irregularities in the issuing of Venezuelan passports and visas, including allegations that passports were given to people with ties to terrorism. The investigation involved reviewing thousands of documents, and conducting interviews in the U.S., Spain, Venezuela and the United Kingdom. One confidential intelligence document obtained by CNN links Venezuela\\'s new Vice President Tareck El Aissami to 173 Venezuelan passports and ID\\'s that were issued to individuals from the Middle East, including people connected to the terrorist group Hezbollah. The accusation that the country was issuing passports to people who are not Venezuelan first surfaced in the early 2000s when Hugo Chavez was the country\\'s president, interviews and records show. A Venezuelan passport permits entry into more than 130 countries without a visa, including 26 countries in the European Union, according to a ranking by Henley and Partners. A visa is required to enter the United States. Over the course of the CNN investigation, Lopez provided documents that show he repeatedly told Venezuelan officials about what he discovered. But he said instead of investigating his allegations, the government targeted him for disclosing confidential information. U.S. officials were also made aware of his findings. \"You cannot be a cop, and a thief at the same time,\" Lopez said. \"I decide to be a cop and do the right thing.\" Doing the right thing has cost him. Unwelcome surprise It didn\\'t start out that way. Lopez, a lawyer who worked as a police officer in Venezuela, said he thought becoming a diplomat was a great career opportunity, which would also allow him to serve his country. With that in mind, he moved to Baghdad to start his new life at the Venezuelan Embassy. But, he recalled, he got an unwelcome surprise on his first day in July 2013. His new boss, Venezuelan Ambassador Jonathan Velasco, gave him a special envelope, he said. \"He gave me an envelope full of visas and passports,\" Lopez recalled. \"He told me, \\'Get this, this is one million U.S. dollars.\\' I thought it was like a joke. Then he told me here people pay a lot of money to get a visa or a passport to leave this country.\" About one month later, Lopez said he realized it was no joke. An Iraqi employee of the embassy, who was hired to be an interpreter, told him she had made thousands of dollars selling Venezuelan passports and visas, he said. And he could make a lot of money, too. But Lopez said he told her it was wrong and he refused. The employee pressed the issue, telling him there were thousands of dollars to be made, he said, even discussing an offer to sell visas to 13 Syrians for $10,000 each. And, Lopez, said, she told him he could get a cut of the money, too. Again, he said he refused. \"I suspect it might be terrorists; that\\'s why I reject, of course, immediately,\" Lopez said. And he said it just got worse. Lists of names Lopez said he was stunned when he found a document inside the embassy. It was a list of 21 Arabic names with corresponding Venezuelan passport numbers and Venezuelan identification numbers. A Venezuelan immigration official told CNN that a cross-check of the passport numbers indicated that the passports are valid and match the names on the list Lopez found -- meaning the people on the list could be able to travel using those passports. But incredibly, a publicly available database in Venezuela examined by CNN shows 20 of the 21 identification numbers are registered to people with Hispanic names -- not the Arabic names listed on the passports. Lopez kept investigating what was going on inside the embassy. He said he even found the case of a convicted drug dealer with an Iraqi identification certificate that appears to show he was born in Iraq. But the man had a Venezuelan passport that said he was born in Venezuela. He kept evidence and notes of what he found. Concerned that the passport and visa scheme was continuing without his knowledge, Lopez investigated the embassy employee who he said had offered to sell passports. He took photos of her desk where he says he found the embassy\\'s official stamp, used to authenticate visas, as well as sheets of papers printed with the Venezuelan government seal. He eventually fired the employee. Lopez did not have any other documents that would confirm the allegations against her. The employee did not respond to repeated requests from CNN for comment. In April 2014, only nine months after he started the job, he emailed a report to Ambassador Velasco about the alleged selling of passports and visas. By then, he said he was convinced that Velasco knew about what was going on inside the embassy. \"He\\'s been there since 2008,\" Lopez said. \"How could he (have) been there so long, couldn\\'t notice that?\" He said Velasco did nothing and even threatened to fire him. By 2015, frustrated that no one would investigate, he took what he found to Delcy Rodriguez, Venezuela\\'s foreign minister. His emailed report said there was \"fraudulent issuing of visas, birth certificates and Venezuelan documents.\" He said nothing happened. Going to the FBI Eventually, with nowhere else to turn, Lopez contacted an FBI official at the U.S. Embassy in Madrid. The two met at a restaurant across the street from the embassy, and the official sent Lopez\\'s information to FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C., a law enforcement source said. The FBI would not comment about what happened with the information. For Lopez, it was his final attempt to get something done. But it was too late. By the end of 2015, the Venezuelan government accused Lopez of \"abandoning his post\" and removed him. A police official showed up at his home in Venezuela with a document that said he was under investigation for revealing \"confidential documents or secrets.\" Looking for answers In an email, Velasco strongly denied Lopez\\'s allegations. \"This embassy is ready open to be audit [sic] and investigated for any international organization and intelligent [sic] Services as well, I don\\'t have nothing to hide or fear. I be sure [sic] that under my duties this embassy don\\'t never [sic] and ever sell Venezuelan nationalities, this will be a joke for all the international security organization [sic] and we already cooperate with the (Iraqi) government and international intelligent [sic] service,\" the email read in English. In an attempt to get answers, a team from CNN en Espa?ol traveled to Caracas last June. In a letter, the government restricted CNN\\'s coverage to stories related to tourism, weather, alternative energy sources and relations among the different government institutions in Venezuela. Rodriguez, the foreign minister, ignored reporter Rafael Romo when he tried to question her at a press event. A government official told the CNN en Espa?ol team that any questions about the passport allegations would be grounds for expulsion from the country. On a second visit to Caracas last August, a CNN en Espa?ol producer and videographer were forced to leave the country after Venezuelan authorities impounded CNN camera equipment at the airport. Last September, Rodriguez represented Venezuela at the United Nations General Assembly. Inside the UN, she again ignored CNN\\'s attempt to ask her questions. Finally, CNN was able to speak with her as she was walking with a small group on the sidewalk across from the UN. As she walked away from the crews, she said, \"You\\'re going to hurt yourself for following the lies of a person who doesn\\'t know what he\\'s talking about.\" She said allegations of selling passports and visas were \"totally\" false. But it\\'s not the first time allegations about Venezuelan passports have been made public. Links to terror U.S. lawmakers heard reports about Venezuelan passport fraud during congressional hearings as far back as 2006. In fact, a congressional report warned, \"Venezuela is providing support, including identity documents that could prove useful to radical Islamic groups.\" And a state department report at the time also concluded that \"Venezuelan travel and identification documents are extremely easy to obtain by persons not entitled to them.\" Roger Noriega, the former US ambassador to the Organization of American States and former assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, said in prepared remarks before a congressional in 2012 that \"Venezuela has provided thousands of phony IDs, passports and visas to persons of Middle Eastern origin.\" Noreiga, who is now managing director of Vision Americas and works for a conservative think tank, told CNN that evidence began to emerge in 2003 in Venezuela that passports were being issued to non-Venezuelans. \"I absolutely believe, and I state it so publicly, that if we do not get our arms around this problem, people are going to die, either our allies or our own personnel or facilities are going to be attacked by networks abetted by the Venezuelans,\" Noriega said. The U.S. State Department declined CNN\\'s request late last year for an interview, instead emailing a link to its 2015 country terrorism overview. That report concluded, \"There were credible reports that Venezuela maintained a permissive environment that allowed for support of activities that benefited known terrorist groups.\" A 2013 confidential intelligence report from a group of Latin American countries obtained by CNN says that from 2008 to 2012, 173 individuals from the Middle East were issued Venezuelan passports and IDs. Among them were people connected to the terrorist group Hezbollah. The official who ordered the issuing of the passports, the report said, is Tareck El Aissami, who was appointed vice president of Venezuela in January. He is the former minister in charge of immigration as well as a governor. El Aissami \"took charge of issuing, granting visas and nationalizing citizens from different countries, especially Syrians, Lebanese, Jordanians, Iranians and Iraqis,\" the report said. He did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Another high-profile Venezuelan linked to terrorism is Ghazi Nasr Al-Din, a former Venezuelan diplomat who worked in the country\\'s embassy in Syria. He is \"wanted for questioning\" by the FBI for \"his fundraising efforts\" with Hezbollah contributors, according to a notice on the FBI website. The bureau confirmed that the information was still active, but would not comment further. U.S. officials say he has \"facilitated the travel\" of Hezbollah members to and from Venezuela, according to a 2008 press release from the U.S. Treasury Department. Leaks in the process What allegedly happened in Iraq is no surprise to General Marco Ferreira, who was in charge of Venezuela\\'s immigration office in 2002. Today, Ferreira is living in Miami after being granted political asylum after he supported a 2002 failed coup against Venezuela\\'s then-President Hugo Chavez. He told CNN that he personally witnessed corrupt senior officials ordering passports for people who were not citizens when he was running the department. He added anyone could get a passport at a local office because each worked independently. He said it was \"very easy\" to assume someone else\\'s identity. \"One of the problems was the corrupted people that was working in that place,\" Ferreira said. \"The second one was the fragility of the system because everything was very old and they have a lot of leaks in the process.\" He said it was \"very, very easy to go and be Venezuelan, or pretend being born in Venezuela.\" Asked about what Misael Lopez described as the alleged passport and visa-selling operation at the Venezuelan Embassy in Iraq, he said he was not surprised. As for Misael Lopez, he\\'s living modestly in Spain, where he also has citizenship; he knows he can\\'t go back to Venezuela. With his safety always an issue, he still says he had to tell his story. And going public, he hopes, will help protect him and his family. \"I did the right thing and I\\'m proud it,\" he said. \"No regrets at all.\"'],\n",

Russian state-run news agency Tass reported Russian President Vladimir Putin held a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and \"conveyed his condolences over a tragic accident causing the death of several Turkish military servicemen. ...\" A Russian Ministry of Defense statement said fighter jets were performing a combat mission to destroy ISIS militants\\' position in the area.

Turkey and Russia have clashed over other deadly incidents involving the military. In November 2015, Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet, killing one pilot and injuring another. The two nations disagreed on whether the plane had violated Turkish airspace. Tensions were further strained in December when the Russian ambassador to Turkey was assassinated at an art gallery in Ankara. Ambassador Andrey Karlov\\'s shooting was captured in real time in photos and video that quickly spread through the Internet worldwide.

       " ['New Dead Sea Scrolls cave discovered (CNN)Excavations on the storied Judean cliffside revealed a new Dead Sea Scrolls cave, full of scroll storage jars and other antiquities, the first such discovery in over 60 years. The discovery upends a decades-old theory in the archaeological community that Dead Sea Scrolls were only found in certain caves at the Qumran cliffs, which are managed by Israel in the West Bank. \"Until now, it was accepted that Dead Sea Scrolls were found only in 11 caves at Qumran, but now there is no doubt that this is the 12th cave,\" said Dr. Oren Gutfeld, one of the project\\'s lead archaeologists. Pottery shards, broken scroll storage jars and their lids -- even neolithic flint tools and arrowheads -- littered the cave\\'s entrance. Farther in, there appeared to be a cave-in. After a bit of work with a small pickax, the team made a monumental find: an unbroken storage jar with a scroll. It was rushed to Hebrew University\\'s conservation lab, where it was unfurled in a protected environment. It had no writing; it was placed in the jar to prepare it for writing. But the effort was not in vain. Scientists soon discovered the cave-in was intentional and it hid a tunnel about 16-20 feet in length. \"At some point hidden in the tunnel, we found a few [three] broken storage jars with the lid,\" said Gutfeld. The team also found the cloth coverings and the leather strap that bound the scrolls the jars once held. The team thinks looters ransacked the cave around the 1950s, pointing to pickaxes left in the tunnel as evidence. \"I imagine they came into the tunnel. They found the scroll jars. They took the scrolls,\" said Gutfeld. \"They even opened the scrolls and left everything around, the textiles, the pottery.\" Over the last few years, researchers believe Dead Sea Scroll fragments made their way onto the antiquity black market. According to Gutfeld, that resurgence led authorities and researchers to embark on the task of surveying all the caves at Qumran in the Judean desert. This is likely just the first in a series of Dead Sea Scroll discoveries, said Gutfeld; they have hundreds of caves and many years to go. \"It\\'s a big project. It\\'s a big operation,\" he said by phone. \"We are very optimistic after 60 years we still find new caves with materials that shed new light on the scrolls.\" According to a news release from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the excavations are part of \"Operation Scroll,\" a joint effort by the university, the Israel Antiquities Authority, the Israel Nature and Parks Authority and the Civil Administration of Judea and Samaria.'],\n",
       " ['Indian boy born with 4 legs, 2 penises recovering after surgery New Delhi (CNN)An Indian boy born with four legs and two penises is set to return home after a successful surgery. Doctors at Bangalore\\'s Narayana Health City described the complexities of the case to local reporters at a news conference Thursday. The boy, who has not yet been named, was born with polymelia -- a rare congenital birth defect that results in extra limbs or organs, which are usually deformed. \"These are problems that happen from time to time and (are) irrespective of socio-economic status,\" said Dr. Sanjay Rao, a senior consultant pediatric surgeon at Narayana Health City who performed the procedure. Rao told CNN the boy\\'s parents gave him permission to discuss the case publicly. \\'Parasitic twin\\' Polymelia is a genetic disorder, which can be caused by chromosomal abnormalities or environmental agents, according to a paper in the Journal of Clinical Imaging Science. The condition can occur when an embryo develops into conjoined twins, but then one twin stops growing but continues to develop extra limbs or organs, which remain attached to the other twin. This was the case for the boy in Bangalore, according to Rao, and it\\'s referred to as \"parasitic twins,\" according to a press release from the hospital. The presence of an extra twin made the surgery, which took place last week, all the more complex, Rao told CNN. The procedure required a team of 20 doctors, nurses and technicians. \"Because the anatomy is not typical, a lot of work had to be done before the operation to clearly define the anatomy, what structures are shared between the parasitic twin and the main baby, the blood vessels need to be identified to control blood loss so there was a lot of pre-operative work to build a road map that would help us during the operation,\" he said. The exact number of cases of polymelia to date, or the likelihood of them occurring, is unknown but Rao said it\\'s uncommon. It\\'s the fourth case the hospital has dealt with in the past decade-- including one in 2008 on a baby girl, Lakshmi Tatma, born in the northern state of Bihar with four legs and four arms. Tatma\\'s story garnered widespread attention. Thousands of religious devotees flocked to see her because they believed she was a reincarnation of Laxmi, the four-armed Hindu goddess of wealth. The journey The boy was born on January 21 in a government-run rural health center in Puladinni village, located in the southern Indian state of Karnataka. Though the birth went smoothly, doctors realized the extra limbs meant the boy would immediately need specialized medical care. He was transported to a local hospital before traveling over 200 miles with his parents to Narayana Health City the day after he was born. The arduous journey took a severe toll on the infant; when he was admitted on January 24 -- at 3 days old -- he was dehydrated and required oxygen support. Superstitions Superstitions and stigma are often synonymous with cases like these in India, especially if the children represent Hindu deities -- like the case of the girl in Bihar. But the boy\\'s parents, Lalitamma and Chennabasava, were quick to recognize that this was a medical condition that required immediate attention. \"Times are changing. Young parents are now more aware about superstitions,\" said Rao. The baby is expected to be discharged within the next week. His follow up care, like the corrective surgery, will be provided for free by Narayana Health City, something his father who works as a farmer is grateful for. There may be cosmetic issues going forward that could require minor procedures, but he\\'ll have a normal childhood, Rao says.'],\n",

It is the second time in two years that Vladimir Kara-Murza, 35, has been hospitalized in grave condition, and his wife, Evgenia, claims the Kremlin is to blame. \"The Russian government and President Putin are responsible for what happened to my husband two years ago, and now, one way or another, I\\'m not saying that they\\'re the ones who did that, but they\\'ve created such a climate in our country, that actually encourages this kind of behavior,\" Evgenia said. CNN cannot independently confirm her claims, and Russia has denied any connection to Kara-Murza\\'s illness. \"It\\'s pure nonsense to make any connection of this unfortunate case with President Putin,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN. Doctors in the hospital where Kara-Murza is being treated say they still \"have no real idea\" what caused his illness, but agree that it was triggered by a \"toxic substance,\" his lawyer Vadim Prokhorov told CNN. He said he has no direct proof his client was poisoned. Doctors have diagnosed Kara-Murza with \"acute intoxication by an unidentified substance,\" Evgenia said, adding that the risks are now more serious due to his previous illness in 2015. Kara-Murza is still too weak and ill to speak, but has been communicating by blinking his eyes, Evgenia said. As of Thursday, he began breathing on his own. Evgenia \\'terrified\\' every time husband returns to Russia Kara-Murza, who lives with his wife and three children in Virginia part-time, was in Russia to promote a documentary on the assassination of his late friend, the former leading opposition figure Boris Nemtsov. Nemtsov was shot to death on a bridge near the Kremlin as he walked home from a restaurant in February 2015. Kara-Murza became ill four months later. Evgenia told CNN that she is \"absolutely terrified\" every time her husband goes back to Russia to do opposition work, but that he is a \"Russian patriot\" committed to his cause. Deputy leader of the Freedom Party, Kara-Murza is also part of the Open Russia foundation, an organization of anti-Putin activists who call for open elections, a free press and civil rights reforms. \\'My major organs began to fail\\' CNN spoke to Kara-Murza in 2015, months after his illness nearly killed him. \"I fell into a coma, all of my major organs began failing, one after another. It was the kidneys first, then the lungs, the heart, the liver,\" he said at the time. He said he believed his 2015 suspected poisoning was a politically motivated attack. \"Frankly there is no other possible reason,\" he said. \"I don\\'t have any money dealings. I don\\'t have any personal enemies. I didn\\'t steal anybody\\'s wife.\" US lawmakers urge investigation Kara-Murza\\'s hospitalization has triggered an outcry from US lawmakers. US Sen. Marco Rubio urged the White House and the State Department to question Russian authorities about the case. \"Vladimir Putin does not deserve any benefit of the doubt here, given how commonplace political assassinations and poisonings have become under his regime,\" said Rubio, a frequent Putin critic. \"I am praying that Kara-Murza\\'s condition improves.\" Speaking about Kara-Murza on Tuesday, US Sen. John McCain delivered a thinly-veiled rebuttal to recent comments by US President Donald Trump that appeared to draw a moral equivalence between the US and Russia. \"Vladimir (Kara-Murza) knew that Putin is a killer. And he\\'s a killer. And he might very well be the next target. Vladimir knew there was no moral equivalence between the United States and Putin\\'s Russia,\" said McCain, who has been a fierce critic of Trump\\'s rhetoric on Russia. McCain\\'s remarks were made after Trump appeared to defend Putin in an interview with Fox News host Bill O\\'Reilly, who described Putin as a \"killer.\" \"There are a lot of killers,\" Trump said. \"You think our country\\'s so innocent?\" Putin\\'s spokesman called on Fox News to apologize. O\\'Reilly responded by telling the Kremlin to \"check in with me around 2023.\" The incident comes amid chatter that a potential meeting between Trump and Putin may be on the cards. \"There\\'s nothing certain,\" Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told journalists on a conference call Thursday. \"There is a common understanding that the priority can be and should be the fight against terrorism and the Islamic State. As for other issues, we will work on them after we understand the format of the meeting,\" Peskov said.'],\n",
       " ['Protests erupt in Paris suburb after alleged police rape (CNN)Violence has erupted on the edge of Paris and spread to at least five nearby towns amid a public outcry over the alleged rape of a young black man by police. Several nights of clashes have broken out after four police officers purportedly forced a 22-year-old man to the ground, beat him, and anally raped him with a baton at a housing estate in the northern Paris suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois. The officers were suspended pending an inquiry into accusations that they used excessive force while arresting the young man, identified only as Th¨¦o, during an identity check last week. All four officers involved in the February 2 incident have been charged with aggravated assault, while one was also charged with rape, according to the Interior Ministry. Victim describes the incident Th¨¦o said that he was walking with his headphones on when he was approached by the police. \"When I realized how violent their tone was, I said to myself \\'they seem pretty serious.\\' So I stood against the wall, and then, one of the policemen beat me,\" Th¨¦o told France\\'s BFM television channel on Tuesday. \"I saw one of them take his baton and stick it into my bum. As soon as he did that, I fell on my belly. I felt weak. It was as if my body had given up on me. Then, they handcuffed me.\" Th¨¦o appealed for calm, telling BFM he had faith in the justice system. \"I call to calm my city because I love it very much,\" Th¨¦o said from his hospital bed. \"Violence is not the way to support me. Justice will do its job.\" \\'Justice for Th¨¦o\\' The incident has roiled the working class Paris suburb where Th¨¦o was allegedly assaulted, igniting racial tensions. Another night of violence gripped Seine-Saint-Denis, a region northeast of Paris with a large migrant population, on Wednesday. Twenty-six people were arrested, a spokesperson for the local prefecture told CNN. A few miles away, near Paris\\' M¨¦nilmontant metro station, several hundred demonstrators gathered to protest police violence. Authorities say 17 people were arrested in Aulnay-sous-Bois on Tuesday night, after protesters torched garbage bins and vehicles. Videos shared on social media showed clashes between riot police and youths as fires burned in the streets. Police fired warning shots into the air to disperse the crowd, according to French reports. On Monday, hundreds of peaceful protesters marched in the same northern suburb. Demonstrators carried banners reading \"Justice for Theo\" past a nearby building that had \"police, rapists\" written on it in graffiti. People shared images of the young man with the hashtag #JusticePourTheo on social media, and a photograph of Th¨¦o with bruises under his eyes and a bandage on his cheek was also circulating online. Bruno Beschizza, the mayor of Aulnay-sous-Bois, released a statement about the violence on Facebook, saying that he was not worried about a repeat of riots in 2005, which were sparked by the death of two teenagers while being chased by police in the nearby neighborhood of Clichy-sous-Bois. \"Obviously we are angry,\" the Mayor\\'s office said in a statement on Wednesday. \"Sometimes the anger was expressed peacefully, sometimes not.\" Beschizza, who had called for a strong reaction from the government, said President Francois Hollande\\'s visit to Aulnay-sous-Bois on Tuesday showed that the state supported the community. Hollande visited Th¨¦o at the suburban hospital where he has been treated since the incident. In a photo shared by Hollande on Twitter, the President can be seen standing at Th¨¦o\\'s bedside. In the tweet, Hollande said Th¨¦o \"reacted with dignity\" and urged him to trust in the justice system. Benoit Hamon, the Socialist presidential candidate, has demanded a diligent and transparent investigation. In a tweet he stated that police \"represent the Republic that protects\" and said that \"trust must urgently be restored.\" Th¨¦o: A fun-loving soccer fanatic Friends have described Th¨¦o as a fun-loving person who never spoke out of hate. \"He is a sociable person, who loves to laugh with everyone,\" Hicham, who has played soccer with Th¨¦o, told CNN. Th¨¦o, who plays at the Institute of Private Football in Aulnay-sous-Bois, is a soccer fanatic. That athleticism runs in the family. Th¨¦o\\'s sister, Aur¨¦lie, is a professional handball player on Le Havre AC, a French women\\'s club. In an interview with BFM on Tuesday, Aur¨¦lie said her brother is still in critical condition. It is still unclear what the consequences of the attack may be, she says, but doctors are talking about incontinence.'],\n",
       " ['DNA saves dog from death penalty (CNN)Jeb, a much-loved service dog for an elderly man, was locked up in animal control when the judge\\'s verdict came in: He would be put to death for killing a neighbor\\'s dog. Jeb\\'s owners, Penny and Kenneth Job of St. Clair, Michigan, couldn\\'t believe that their sweet Jeb, the same gentle dog who helps Ken get up when he falls down, who lives peacefully with three other dogs, seven cats and a coopful of chickens, could ever harm another living being. So the family used a forensic technique often used for human defendants to save their dog from death row last fall. The perfect service dog Jeb Stuart Job stands hip-high, with a muscular frame, big dark eyes and a long black snout. He\\'s had a rough two years on this Earth. In January 2016, when he wasn\\'t quite a year old, he was found chained inside a shed in Detroit. His owner had died, and the rest of the family didn\\'t want him. Kandie Morrison, a volunteer with a dog rescue agency, got the call. Once Morrison met Jeb, she thought he\\'d make the perfect service dog for her father; that\\'s Kenneth Job. Job, 79, an Air Force veteran who owned a drywall business, has a neurodegenerative disease called Charcot-Marie-Tooth. He fell in love with the Belgian Malinois puppy. Dr. Karen Pidick, their veterinarian and neighbor in their rural Michigan town, trained Jeb to help Job stay steady on his shaky legs. The family was a happy one until eight months later. According to court testimony, on the morning of August 24, the Jobs\\' neighbor, Christopher Sawa, looked out his kitchen window and saw Jeb standing over the lifeless body of his own dog, Vlad. Vlad weighed 14 pounds. Jeb weighed about 90 pounds. Sawa ran out into his yard. He tried to give Vlad mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but it was too late. The tiny Pomeranian was dead. Sawa called animal control and blamed Jeb. Animal control took the big dog into custody. The trial of Jeb Stuart Job On September 19, all parties gathered at district court in St. Clair County. If Judge Michael Hulewicz deemed Jeb a \"dangerous animal,\" the dog would be put to death. Sawa, the Jobs\\' neighbor for more than 30 years, testified about finding Jeb standing over his dead Pomeranian. \"It was horrifying. It was terrifying,\" he said, according to transcripts. CNN contacted the Sawas, who declined to comment. He said it wasn\\'t the first time Jeb had scared him. \"I was afraid of the dog. The dog always barked,\" he said. Now, his beloved Vlad was gone. \"We\\'ve never had any children,\" he testified. \"The dog was like a child to us.\" Job testified that Jeb had indeed gotten away from him that morning: He and the Jobs\\' other three dogs had run off in the opposite direction of the Sawa home, toward a house with a pond where they liked to swim. The Jobs\\' attorney, Edward Marshall, pointed to a lack of physical evidence linking Jeb to Vlad\\'s death and questioned whether another large animal had killed Vlad. After all, Pidick, the neighborhood vet, had testified that an unfriendly stray dog had been spotted in the neighborhood, and foxes were known to live in the surrounding woods. In the end, the judge said Jeb met the legal definition of a dangerous animal, and he made what he said was a tough decision. \"I have no choice except to follow out the state law that the animal would be destroyed,\" Hulewicz said. \"I don\\'t like to do this. I don\\'t like it at all.\" A lifesaving procedure That\\'s when the Job family asked to have testing done to see whether Jeb\\'s DNA matched the DNA in Vlad\\'s wound. They said they hadn\\'t asked for it sooner because they thought Vlad had been cremated and there would be no way to get his DNA. But at the trial, it came out that Vlad\\'s body was in a freezer. The Jobs arranged to have swabs taken from Vlad\\'s wound and the inside of Jeb\\'s cheek. The samples were sent to the Maples Center for Forensic Medicine at the University of Florida College of Medicine. The process cost $416, according to the Jobs. On October 24, exactly two months after Jeb was taken into custody, AnnMarie Clark, a forensic DNA analyst at the center, sent in her findings: The DNA in the wound didn\\'t match Jeb\\'s DNA. \"Jeb is not the dog that killed (Vlad),\" Clark wrote. \"We were relieved. We were absolutely relieved,\" said Penny Job, Ken\\'s wife. The DNA showed that another dog had killed Jeb, Clark told CNN -- but exactly who that dog is may forever be a mystery. Dogs have no rights Jeb was allowed to go home the following week, after his owners signed an agreement promising that they would make sure Jeb wouldn\\'t leave the yard unleashed and that they would maintain a secure fence to keep their animals in the yard. The Jobs say Jeb came home a very different dog. They say that during his nine weeks in animal control, he went from 90 to 75 pounds, and he became scared and skittish. \"The dog was thin and sick,\" Penny Job said. \"And he lost all his social skills. He was afraid to go outside.\" Jeb\\'s weight wasn\\'t taken when he entered and left animal control, said Steve Campau, a spokesman for the St. Clair County sheriff\\'s office, which oversees animal control. \"We fed him a meal day,\" Campau said. \"Maybe he was overfed at home.\" Campau also said some behavior changes are to be expected after an animal is released from spending nine weeks of spending 23 hours a day in a kennel that\\'s 6 feet long by 3Â½ feet wide. \"Veterinarians say after a dog is in a kennel environment for an extended period of time, there\\'s certainly going to be an adjustment period when the dog gets out,\" Campau said. Even now, more than three months after his return home, Jeb is still scared of strange men, his owners say. Still bitter that their innocent dog was nearly put to death, Jeb\\'s owners wonder why they had to come up with the idea of DNA analysis. Why didn\\'t the court do it before condemning Jeb to death? After all, that kind of testing is often done with human defendants. The answer is simple, according to David Favre, a professor at Michigan State University College of Law and editor in chief of the Animal Legal and Historical Center. Humans accused of a crime have rights under criminal due process. \"In a criminal prosecution, where you\\'re putting a person in jail, we have the highest level of protection,\" Favre said. It\\'s a different story with dogs. \"Dogs have no rights. They\\'re property,\" Favre said. He wonders whether courts should reconsider and make DNA analysis a regular part of the process when a dog\\'s life hangs in the balance. \"It\\'s an easy thing to do. We just haven\\'t thought of it in this context,\" he said. He applauds the Jobs for saving their pet. \"Now people will realize they can do this, that it\\'s a tool,\" he said. \"They used a very creative defense.\"'],\n",
       " ['Could we one day make babies from only skin cells? (CNN)In the not-so-distant future, research suggests, eggs and sperm may no longer be needed to make a baby -- at least not in the traditional way. In 2016, scientists in Japan revealed the birth of mice from eggs made from a parent\\'s skin cells, and many researchers believe the technique could one day be applied to humans. The process, called in vitro gametogenesis, allows eggs and sperm to be created in a culture dish in the lab. Adult cells, such as skin cells, can be reprogrammed to behave like embryonic stem cells and are then known as induced pluripotent stem cells. These cells can be stimulated to grow into eggs or sperm, which in turn are used to form an embryo for implantation into an adult womb. Though most scientists agree we\\'re still a long way off from doing it clinically, it\\'s a promising technology that has the potential to replace traditional in vitro fertilization to treat infertility. If and when this process is successful in humans, the implications would be immense, but scientists are now raising legal and ethical questions that need to be addressed before the technology becomes a reality. A replacement for IVF? In vitro gametogenesis, or IVG, is similar to IVF -- in vitro fertilization -- in that the joining of egg and sperm takes place in a culture dish. But with IVF, you have to collect eggs from the woman and sperm from the man, either surgically or non-surgically, said professor Alan Trounson of the Hudson Institute of Medical Research at Monash University in Australia. \"Or you can do egg or sperm donation or a combination of both.\" Trounson believes IVG can provide hope for couples when IVF is not an option. This procedure can \"help men or women who have no gametes -- no sperm or eggs,\" said Trounson, a renowned stem cell scientist best known for developing human IVF with Carl Wood in 1977. Another potential benefit with IVG is that there is no need for a woman to receive high doses of fertility drugs to retrieve her eggs, as with traditional IVF. In addition, same-sex couples would be able to have biological children, and people who lost their gametes through cancer treatments, for instance, would have a chance at having biological children. In theory, a single woman could also conceive on her own, a concept that Sonia M. Suter, professor of law at George Washington University, calls \"solo IVG.\" She points out that it comes with some risk, as there will be less genetic variety among the babies. \"Solo IVG -- unlike \\'natural\\' reproduction -- increases the possibility of homozygosity (identical genes) for recessive genes, contributing to a greater risk of disease and disability,\" she wrote in a 2015 paper in the Oxford Academic Journal of Law and the Biosciences. She added that the risk is even greater than with cloning and although you could use genetic diagnosis to find disease in embryos before implantation, it wouldn\\'t fully reduce the risk. This all contributes to the fact that IVG is much more complicated than one might think, and experts add that the process will be even more complex in humans than in mice. \"It\\'s a much tougher prospect to do this in a human -- much, much tougher. It\\'s like climbing a few stairs versus climbing a mountain,\" Trounson said. \"Gametogenesis (in a mouse) is much faster. Everything is much faster and less complicated than you have in a human. So you\\'ve got to make sure there\\'s very long intervals to get you the right outcome. ... Life, gametogenesis, everything, is much, much briefer than it is in a human.\" Most scientists are reluctant to commit to an exact time frame, but it\\'s probably safe to say they\\'re many years away. \"Most likely, we are one to two decades away from IVG being attempted in humans in a responsible, evidence-based, government-approved manner, but as we\\'ve seen with other new stem cell and reproductive technologies, practitioners don\\'t always follow the rules,\" explained Paul Knoepfler, a prominent stem cell scientist at the University of California, Davis who writes a blog on stem cell research. \\'Rogue biomedical endeavors\\' Knoepfler used the example of an unapproved and, he says, potentially dangerous three-person baby produced in Mexico in 2016 by a US doctor without FDA approval. Creating a three-person baby involves a process known as pronuclear transfer, in which an embryo is created using genetic material from three people -- the intended mother and father and an egg donor -- to remove the risk of genetic diseases caused by DNA in a mother\\'s mitochondria. The mitochondria are parts of a cell used to create energy but also carry DNA that is passed on only through the maternal line. This process recently received approval in the UK, but it remains illegal in many countries, including the US. \"Because it seems rogue biomedical endeavors are on the increase, someone could try IVG without sufficient data or governmental approval in the next five to 10 years,\" Knoepfler said. \"IVG takes us into uncharted territory, so it\\'s hard to say legal issues that might come up,\" he said, adding that \"even other more extreme technologies, such as cloning, of the reproductive kind are not technically prohibited in the US.\" Legal and ethical challenges For IVG to be researched further, it will be necessary to perform IVF using the derived gametes and then to study the embryos in ways that would involve their destruction. \"At a minimum, federal funding could not be used for such work, but what other laws might come into play is less clear,\" Knoepler said. There are growing calls among researchers for regulators to revisit the \"14-day rule,\" an international agreement three decades old that says an embryo can\\'t be maintained in culture longer than two weeks. The \"primitive streak\" -- a visible band of cells along the head to tail axis of the embryo -- appears on day 15. Some see the rule as essentially a moral compromise between researchers and those who believe that destroying embryos is murder. In several countries, the implantation of a fertilized egg is not allowed if it\\'s been maintained longer than 14 days. Dr. Mahendra Rao, scientific adviser with the New York Stem Cell Foundation, explained that in the US, scientists can legally make sperm and oocytes (immature eggs) from other cells and perform IVF. But they would not be able to perform implantation, even in animals. He said there needs to be clarity that this rule doesn\\'t apply to \"synthetic\" embryos scientists are building in culture, where there\\'s no intention of implanting them. We may be more likely to see the first human IVG experiments performed in Asia, because laws are generally less restrictive there. The leading scientists are in Japan and China, according to George Daley, co-author of a recent editorial on the issue in the journal Science Translational Medicine. Daley and his co-authors highlight concerns over \"embryo farming\" and the consequence of parents choosing an embryo with preferred traits. \"IVG could, depending on its ultimate financial cost, greatly increase the number of embryos from which to select, thus exacerbating concerns about parents selecting for their \\'ideal\\' future child,\" they write. With a large number of eggs available through IVG, the process might exacerbate concerns about the devaluation of human life, the authors say. Also worrying is the potential for someone to get hold of your genetic material -- such as sloughed-off skin cells -- without your permission. The authors raise questions about the legal ramifications and how they would be handled in court. \"Should the law consider the source of the skin cells to be a legal parent to the child, or should it distinguish an individual\\'s genetic and legal parentage?\" they ask. As new forms of assisted reproductive technology stretch our ideas about identity, parentage and existing laws and regulations around stem cell research, researchers highlight the need to address these thoughts and have answers in place before making IVG an option.'],\n",

Speaking in east London at the launch of \"Andy Murray Live 2017,\" the Olympic champion said it would be \"incredible\" for tennis fans in Scotland to watch Federer, 35, play at the SSE Hydro on November 7. \"All of us involved in this event are very, very lucky that he\\'s agreed to do it. I\\'m really looking forward to it,\" added the 29-year-old, who first staged \"Andy Murray Live\" last year. \"He\\'s just really popular everywhere.

Despite having not played competitively for six months as he recovered from injury, Federer won his 18th grand slam in Melbourne last month, beating Rafael Nadal -- another player whose season was hampered by injury last year -- in the final.

       " ['Amid flurry of new cancer drugs, how many offer real benefits? Marlene McCarthy\\'s breast cancer has grown relentlessly over the past seven years, spreading painfully through her bones and making it impossible to walk without a cane. Although the 73-year-old knows there\\'s no cure for her disease, she wants researchers to do better. It\\'s been years, she said, since she has found a drug that has actually helped. McCarthy said she\\'s frustrated that the Food and Drug Administration is approving cancer drugs without proof that they cure patients or help them live longer. \"That simply isn\\'t good enough,\" said McCarthy, of Coventry, R.I. \"I understand [why] that could be satisfactory for some people. It isn\\'t to me.\" Pushed by patient advocates who want earlier access to medications, the Food and Drug Administration has approved a flurry of oncology drugs in recent years, giving some people with cancer a renewed sense of hope and an array of expensive new options. A few of these drugs have been clear home runs, allowing patients with limited life expectancies to live for years. Many more drugs, however, have offered patients only marginal benefits, with no evidence that they improve survival or quality of life, said Dr. Vinay Prasad, assistant professor of medicine at the Oregon Health and Sciences University, who has written extensively about the FDA\\'s approval process for cancer drugs. Overall cancer survival has barely changed over the past decade. The 72 cancer therapies approved from 2002 to 2014 gave patients only 2.1 more months of life than older drugs, according to a study in JAMA Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery. And those are the successes. Two-thirds of cancer drugs approved in the past two years have no evidence showing that they extend survival at all, Prasad said. The result: For every cancer patient who wins the lottery, there are many others who get little to no benefit from the latest drugs. \"We are very concerned about the push to get more drugs approved, instead of effective drugs approved,\" said Fran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, who said the last game-changing breast cancer drug, Herceptin, was approved nearly 20 years ago. In a November study published in JAMA Internal Medicine, researcher Diana Zuckerman looked at 18 approved cancer drugs that didn\\'t help patients live longer. Only one had clear data showing that it improved patients\\' lives, such as by relieving pain or fatigue. Two drugs harmed quality of life. For example, thyroid cancer patients taking the most expensive drug, cabozantinib, scored worse on a scale measuring five symptoms: diarrhea, fatigue, sleep disturbance, distress, and difficult remembering, Zuckerman said. \"Our patients need drugs that provide the greatest possible benefit, particularly when you put that in the context of cost,\" said Dr. Richard Schilsky, senior vice president and chief medical officer at the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which represents cancer specialists. \"You begin to question what is the real value of a therapy when the benefit is small, the toxicity may be similar to a previous drug and the cost is much higher.\" Cancer drugs approved last year cost an average of $171,000 a year, according to the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at New York\\'s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Although the high prices can lead patients to think they\\'re getting the Mercedes of cancer drugs, research shows that a medication\\'s price has no relationship to how well it works. \"We cannot have a system where drugs that may not even work are being sold for these amazingly crazy amounts of money,\" said Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research, a nonprofit in Washington that aims to explain research to consumers. Recognizing the slow pace of progress, the American Society of Clinical Oncology has set goals for new cancer drugs of extending life or controlling tumors for at least 2.5 months. The bar was set relatively low because \"it\\'s not very often that we come across a transformative treatment,\" said Dr. Sham Mailankody, an assistant attending physician and myeloma specialist at Memorial Sloan Kettering. Yet in a study published in September in JAMA Oncology, Mailankody found that only one in five cancer drugs approved from 2014 to 2016 met those standards. Even those slim gains, achieved during carefully controlled clinical trials, can evaporate in the real world, where patients are often older and sicker than those who participate in research studies, said Hanna Sanoff, an associate professor and section chief of the University of North Carolina School of Medicine Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology Program. Cancer is primarily a disease of aging; 59% of patients are over 65 and 30% are older than 75. Yet only 33% of participants in cancer trials are over age 65 and just 10% are over 75, according to a 2012 study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. In a study published in September in The Oncologist, Sanoff found that a drug that improved survival in liver cancer by three months offered no survival advantage among Medicare patients outside the clinical trial. McCarthy, who reviews breast cancer research proposals for the Department of Defense, said she was twice turned down for clinical trials because of her age. When researching experimental therapies, \"I\\'d get excited by something that seemed promising, only to be told I was too old to join the trial, because the cutoff age was 70,\" she said. Lowering the bar FDA officials said there are good reasons why many promising cancer drugs lack evidence of improved survival. Because some cancers grow slowly, it can take many years for a study to show whether a new drug helps people live longer, said Dr. Richard Pazdur, director of the FDA\\'s Oncology Center of Excellence. While individual drugs may only modestly improve survival, \"when used sequentially or in combination, they can transform a disease,\" Pazdur said. The design of some cancer trials also can make it hard to tell if drugs help patients live longer. That\\'s because many trials now allow patients in the control group the opportunity to \"cross over\" to get the drug being studied, if preliminary data suggests it could help them, Pazdur said. While such crossover benefits people in the study, who are facing a life-threatening disease, it can lead to inconclusive findings. Lastly, Pazdur said that overall survival rates also don\\'t reflect that fact that some drugs, such as targeted therapies for lung cancer, allow a subset of patients to do extremely well, surviving for years instead of months. The number of patients with advanced melanoma who survive five years after diagnosis has increased from 5 percent before the advent of immune therapies to 30 percent to 40 percent today, said Dr. Steven O\\'Day, director of immuno-oncology and clinical research at the John Wayne Cancer Institute at Providence Saint John\\'s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif. Immune therapies work by stimulating a patient\\'s natural immune system to combat cancer cells. \"There is a lot of excitement about these [immunotherapy] drugs, and for good reason,\" Schilsky said. \"There\\'s no diminishing the progress that\\'s been made.\" The FDA wants to give patients the chance to benefit as soon as possible, rather than waiting for definitive proof of improved survival, Pazdur said. In some cases, the FDA requires pharmaceutical companies to perform long-term studies after drugs are approved, to measure whether drugs live up to their early promise. But many of these studies never provide an answer, Zuckerman said. Once a drug is approved and is available to anyone, patients have no incentive to participate in a clinical trial. So studies can end with no clear conclusion. In a 2015 study, Prasad looked at 36 drugs approved without proven survival advantages. More than four years later, only five had evidence of improved survival. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer at the American Cancer Society, said he\\'s concerned that the FDA is lowering its standards. \"We\\'re getting less rigorous scientifically because we want to get these drugs out to people faster,\" Brawley said. Unless the FDA requires companies to provide survival data before approving a drug, \"we may never have answers,\" Zuckerman said. \"We will have all of these expensive drugs on the market and we will never have the information we need about how well they work or even how safe they are.\" President Donald Trump has vowed to cut regulations at the FDA and recently told pharmaceutical industry leaders that he wants to further speed up the drug approval process. Helpful or harmful? Cancer patients, who are making decisions at a time of intense stress, don\\'t always understand the full risks and benefits of therapy, Brawley said. Studies suggest that both patients and doctors tend to overestimate drugs\\' benefits, but underestimate their risks and side effects. A study of 2,944 people in JAMA Internal Medicine found that 39 percent mistakenly believed the FDA only approves \"extremely effective\" drugs, while 25 percent mistakenly believed the agency only approves treatments without serious side effects. Even doctors think \"we are better than I actually think we are,\" Brawley said. \"The thought that these drugs could be harmful is foreign to them.\" One of the biggest recent changes at the FDA is that more drugs are being approved based on \"progression-free survival\" â\\x80?medical jargon for the amount of time that patients live while their tumors are under control. Because small changes in tumor size aren\\'t always clearly visible on scans, doctors consider tumors to be under control as long as they don\\'t grow more than 20 percent, Brawley said. Doctors always hope that a drug that delays tumor growth will help patients live longer. But in a study published in 2015, Prasad found that most statistical analyses have found the link between progression-free survival and overall survival to be very weak. Measures such as progression-free survival \"are just a guess as to whether or not the drug actually works,\" Brawley said. \"The problem with approving a drug based on a progression-free survival is that you don\\'t know if the drug is actually doing anything positive for the patient.\" Brawley said he\\'s concerned that patients could be harmed by oncology drugs whose long-term side effects are unknown. The drug Avastin, which was approved for breast cancer in 2008, without evidence that it improved survival, lost its approval three years later, after studies showed it did not help people live longer. The FDA concluded that life-threatening side effects, which included heart attacks, bleeding and high blood pressure, outweighed the drug\\'s benefits. \"There are all these drugs that we used for a long, long time, but we ended up taking them off the market because we finally realized they were harmful,\" Brawley said. \"We are setting ourselves up for that again.\" McCarthy has been disappointed in the new cancer therapies she\\'s tried. The last drug that kept her tumors from growing was letrozole, which was approved in 1997. It kept McCarthy\\'s tumors under control for three years. In 2015, after her tumors began growing again, McCarthy began a new breast cancer drug, called Ibrance. The FDA approved Ibrance because it improved progression-free survival by 10 months when combined with a standard hormonal therapy. Four months after McCarthy began the drug, however, scans found new bone tumors. A spokeswoman for Pfizer, Sally Beatty, noted that Ibrance\\'s proven benefits have improved since then. In a study published in November, women taking the Ibrance combination lived 24.8 months with limited tumor growth, compared to 14.5 months for women who took the hormonal therapy alone. McCarthy opted not to try another breast cancer drug, Afinitor, after doctors warned her that it posed too many risks. The FDA approved Afinitor in 2012 because it limited tumor growth for four months longer than placebo. \"That\\'s nothing to be excited about,\" said McCarthy, who has four children and four grandchildren. \"I want to live more than four months.\" But keeping tumors in check can be a huge help to patients, said Pazdur, who notes that there are many ways for drugs to help patients, even without extending life. Shrinking a bone tumor, for example, can relieve pain. Shrinking a lung tumor can make it easier for someone to breathe. \"Most patients are pleased if they go to the doctor and the doctor says, \\'Your scan says everything is stable. There are no new lesions,\\'\" Schilsky said. \"I\\'ve given that result to patients many times over the years and they are all happy about it. Are they as happy as they would be if the tumor were gone? Of course not. But being free from progression and otherwise feeling OK is not such a bad outcome.\" As someone with incurable cancer, McCarthy remains frustrated with the pace of progress. Scientists, she said, aren\\'t asking the right questions. McCarthy said she wants researchers to focus on prevention of cancer, and to learn why breast cancers like her can remain dormant for years before suddenly reactivating. Her cancer, which was first diagnosed when she was 44, disappeared for two decades before reappearing in her bones. \"The status quo isn\\'t good enough,\" said McCarthy. \"I want us to have a breast cancer vaccine to prevent my granddaughter from getting cancer. I\\'ll be working for that with my dying breath.\"'],\n",

In this video series, CNN meets the men and women bringing those ideas to life. Bill Gates is a man on a mission. The 61-year-old co-founder of Microsoft, who has an estimated fortune of nearly $85 billion according to Forbes, is well known for his philanthropic work. In an interview with CNN, recorded in October, Gates talked about his commitment to tackling disease and famine. \"Our foundation focuses on the diseases of poor countries such as malaria, HIV, diarrhea and pneumonia,\" Gates told CNN. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is investing millions in combating mosquito-borne diseases in Latin America. \"In every one of those cases, we\\'ve made huge progress. We\\'ve cut the number of children under five with diarrhea from 13 million 25 years ago to six million today.\" With his brief laid bare, we asked Gates for advice on tackling some of the biggest challenges facing the globe. How to save the world from disease ... \"We\\'ll never get it to zero,\" said Gates on how to rid the planet of disease. \"But the science today should give us tools to solve a lot of the big killers.\" He said disease could still be \"cut in half,\" eventually reaching a point where \"a child in a poor country doesn\\'t have a dramatically increased chance of dying compared to other children.\" So how do we inspire this scientific innovation in the next generation? \"Understanding what the problems of the world are, I think that stimulates people,\" said Gates, before rushing off to another appointment to spread his message -- and money -- further. ... and famine \"It\\'s about increasing food productivity,\" said Gates matter-of-factly, when asked how to save the world from famine. \"We have one-fifth the productivity in Africa that we have in Europe and the United States. So better seed varieties, access to fertilizer... and the use of cell phones so that market information is more available.\" Gates added that African countries could learn from the way some Asian countries had pulled themselves out of famine and dramatically increased crop production. It\\'s going to be OK While there are still huge challenges facing society, Gates has an optimistic outlook. \"The trend is good,\" he said. \"The reduction in violence, the understanding the science, you know, the treatment of women. We have a lot more to do, but, you know, certainly, 30 years ago, it was a lot worse than it is today.\"'],\n",

But thanks to new technology and sophisticated architecture, modern cellars can mimic Mother Nature almost anywhere. Whether high on a hilltop or built into a bunker, beautiful wine storage solutions can now be found in some surprising places. \"Today, putting a wine cellar in your 33rd-floor apartment is just as easy as in an underground cellar,\" says James Molesworth, senior editor of Wine Spectator. Molesworth points to ChÃ¢teau Cheval Blanc, in Bordeaux, as an exemplary above-ground wine cellar. \"For me the key is combining both visual eye candy with actual practicality and efficiency,\" says Molesworth. Above ground Designed by Christian de Portzamparc, ChÃ¢teau Cheval Blanc\\'s undulating white facade appears at home on a hilltop in the French countryside, complete with its own grassy rooftop. Stretching across 19,685 square feet, the avant-garde cellar streams natural light across artfully lined rows of concrete white vats. \"All the vats are cement and pear-shaped, corresponding to parcel sizes on the vineyard,\" says Molesworth. Carefully labeled with the plot number, capacity, grape variety and date planted, these vats allow Cheval Blanc to manage fine details within a vast vineyard. \"By devoting individual vats to each plot, the winemaking team can pick each parcel when they wish, and then manage smaller and smaller vinifications before eventual blending,\" says Molesworth. \"In essence, they are handling the vineyards at its smallest pixilation, then assembling the final picture -- or blend -- from that,\" says Molesworth. Precision storage Another unconventional cellar -- albeit subterranean -- is Hong Kong\\'s Crown Wine Cellars in Shouson Hill, discretely hidden on the south side of Hong Kong Island. Buried 60 feet underground inside a network of former military bunkers, the cellars are accessed through a concrete tunnel that opens into a series of 1,000-square-foot chambers, each of which are protected by 3-foot-thick reinforced concrete walls. While it appears rugged on the outside, the cellar\\'s interior features state-of-the-art climate-control technology to protect its clients\\' rare vintages stored inside. \"Temperature and humidity are the two key things -- a quiet, stable environment too, with no vibration,\" says Molesworth of an ideal cellaring environment. \"You wouldn\\'t put a wine cellar under train tracks, basically.\" The perfect conditions? Approximately 70% humidity, stable temperatures between 50-55 degrees Fahrenheit, and little to no light. \"Ideally, wine should be stored in a dark space as ultraviolet light destroys wine -- hence colored glass bottles,\" says Adam Bilbey, a wine specialist with auction house Sotheby\\'s. \"And wine should be kept lying still at a perfectly horizontal angle.\" Contemporary classics Of course, even with an influx of contemporary cellars, the classics aren\\'t going anywhere. Take US billionaire William Koch\\'s now famous Palm Beach wine cellar in Florida, which pays homage to traditional European cellars of days gone by. One of three extraordinary facilities he maintains -- the other two are in Aspen, Colorado and Cape Cod, Massachusetts -- its underground labyrinth of Austrian red bricks and custom-built arched doorways houses a selection of the wines from his 20,000-bottle collection, one of the largest in the US. \"An incredible attention to detail was needed to create this masterpiece. With Koch\\'s legendary collection of wine, it was fitting it should be cellared in such a beautiful way,\" says Bilbey.

       " ['\\'Male brains\\' linked to higher autism risk in women, study says (CNN)Brains, like faces, have features seen as either more masculine or more feminine. One feature of brain anatomy that is characteristic of males is associated with an increased risk of autism, according to a study published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association\\'s Psychiatry edition. Women with male characteristic brains are three times more likely to have autism than women with more \"female\" brains, the researchers say. Yet the reverse was not been proven true; no evidence indicates that men with more female-trait brains are less at risk for autism than men with typical brains. Autism is considered a neurodevelopmental condition, which means symptoms begin early and children fail to achieve typical milestones of maturity at appropriate ages. Common symptoms include difficulty with communication and repetitive behaviors. In the United States, about one in 68 children has been identified with autism spectrum disorder, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The term \"spectrum\" refers to the fact that symptoms, levels of disability and positive skills may vary from person to person. For example, some people along the spectrum cannot make eye contact or follow simple directions, while others may be exceptional at math. And, as they age, some children with autism will learn to function more or less normally, while others will require substantial support to perform basic activities. Autism spectrum disorder is two to five times more common in males than in females, according to Christine Ecker, lead author of the new study and a professor at Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany. Though some researchers say sex differences in symptoms account for different rates of diagnosis, others hypothesize that sex-related variations in brain anatomy may contribute to the higher risk among males. Gender differences For the new study, Ecker and her co-authors examined whether brain anatomy differences led to a higher probability of autism in males. Specifically, they looked at cortical thickness: the depth of gray matter across the surface of the cortex. \"For example, it is known from previous studies that females tend to have a thicker cortex than males in various regions of the brain,\" Ecker wrote in an email. Previous studies have also shown thickness to be significantly altered in people with autism. Study participants included 98 high-functioning adults with autism (49 of them men) and 98 adults without autism (51 of them men). Both groups were roughly within the same age range: mid-20s, on average. The researchers excluded anyone with a history of psychiatric disorders, head injuries, certain genetic disorders or other medical conditions affecting brain function, such as epilepsy. People taking mood stabilizers and other medications were also excluded. The researchers conducted MRI brain scans on each participant and then derived cortical thickness patterns for each using a software program. After anonymizing this information, Ecker and her colleagues made predictions about which participants were male or female based on cortical thickness and overall physical characteristics, also referred to as the \"brain phenotype.\" \"We found that brain phenotype ranged from being typically female to typically male, and that there is variability between these extremes,\" Ecker said. This is true of all of us: Regardless of sex, our brains fall somewhere along a continuum, with extreme male and extreme female at either end. The variety in the middle is healthy and normal, said Ecker. Among the study participants, 68.1% of the biological female brains fell closer to the female extreme while 74.5% of biological male brains fell closer to the male extreme. Hope for earlier diagnoses Cortical thickness did not unfailingly identify female or male brains, but the researchers found a constellation of sex-related brain structure differences, and based on this, they were able to separate males from females in most cases. \"Overall, our approach was approximately 74% accurate in predicting biological sex based on brain anatomy,\" Ecker said. Further analyzing the data, Ecker and her colleagues discovered that the probability of autism increased significantly among the participants, whether male or female, whose brain phenotype was more typical of males. In fact, female participants with brain anatomy more typical of males were three times more likely to have autism than females with a more typical brain. With this approach, autism risk could be estimated \"for individuals based on how characteristically female or male their brain is,\" Ecker explained. Though she and her colleagues have examined only adult brains so far, Ecker said \"in future research, we are hoping to apply our approach to younger age groups as well.\" Early use of this method in a child\\'s life could offer earlier diagnosis among those who might then benefit from earlier intervention, she said. Early training is known to have the best results for normalizing children with autism. According to Dr. Tuong-Vi Nguyen, an assistant professor at McGill University in Montreal, the new study is \"provocative\" with \"good methodology.\" Nguyen, who was not involved in the current study, has investigated the sex-specific effects of testosterone on brain structure between ages 4 and 24. \"Given that the authors\\' predominant theory is that a male-typic brain represents a predisposition to autism, their results only partially confirm this,\" she said. She suggested a more conservative rephrasing of the new study\\'s main finding: \"Female, high-functioning individuals with autism spectrum disorder (a very small portion of the overall autism spectrum disorder population), have an increased likelihood of showing a male-typic pattern of brain structure, more specifically, male-typic patterns of cortical thickness.\" She cites the fact that \"there was no significant decrease in autism spectrum disorder risk if males had a more female-typic brain structure.\" \"It is definitely too early to say if these neuroimaging tools could be used clinically to predict\" autism spectrum disorder, she said, adding that \"no change to current clinical management can be derived from the results of this study.\"'],\n",

From February 9 to 25, 2018, the city of PyeongChang will welcome nearly 3,000 athletes from nearly 100 nations for the first Winter Olympics to be held on South Korean soil. It will kick off a series of high-profile sporting events in Asia over the next four years, with Tokyo hosting the 2020 Summer Olympics and Beijing the host city for the Winter Olympics in 2022. READ: Ski like a South Korean To avoid any potential confusion with North Korea\\'s capital Pyongyang, the PyeongChang resort -- which is 50 miles south of the demilitarized zone that separates the two countries -- has changed its name for the Games, capitalizing the C for the first time. A record 102 gold medals will be up for grabs in 15 disciplines at PyeongChang 2018, while four events will be making their Winter Olympic debuts, with the introduction of Big Air snowboarding -- athletes performing tricks after launching from large jumps -- giving the Games a youthful vibe. A $78 million, 50,000-capacity temporary Olympic Stadium, which will host the opening and closing ceremonies, is set to be completed in September. It\\'s one of six new venues being built. In total, 13 venues, split between PyeongChang and neighboring city Gangneung, will be used during the 17 days of the Games. Impeachment & political scandals Yet, as the 12-month countdown begins, South Koreans have been distracted by other events. The country\\'s Constitutional Court is deliberating a motion to impeach President Park Geun-hye over a corruption scandal which sparked weeks of protests in the capital Seoul. It is a far cry from the deafening cheers which greeted the 2011 announcement that the ski resort of PyeongChang, about 180km east of Seoul, would host the Winter Olympics. READ: South Korea presidential scandal - what you need to know Companies have reportedly been reluctant to sign up to sponsorship deals, leaving the organizing committee with a shortfall. The total cost for the Games is said to be just over $10 billion, a contrast to the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics which cost five times more. Lee Hee-beom, president of PyeongChang 2018, told reporters this week: \"Some part was affected by the political scandal, and some part by the situation of the economy.\" He said he\\'s hoping the Games can help shake off the \"negative image\" that came from what he called \"a series of unsubstantiated rumors\" associated with the political scandal. \"Some even went as far as saying we should give up on hosting the Olympics,\" he said. \"But, fortunately, the prevailing opinion is that we should all try to restore our national pride with the Olympics. And we\\'re concentrating only on holding a successful Olympics. \"I know that we are criticized for little public awareness of the 2018 Winter Olympics. I expect the one-year countdown event will add momentum to boost public awareness worldwide.\" \\'North Korea is not the exception\\' The Games are being held in a province which witnessed fierce battles during the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in a truce not a peace treaty. South Korea had rejected the North\\'s suggestion to co-host the Games by holding some of the skiing events at its Masik resort, in Kangwon, east of the capital Pyongyang. North Korea has previously sent teams to participate in recent international sporting events held in the South and Lee urged North Korea to send athletes to the Games. \"The basic principles of Olympics is peace,\" he told reporters. \"Anyone who loves peace should participate, have the right to participate.

       " ['Why this choir is a huge hit with China\\'s stressed out millennials Hong Kong (CNN)As millions of young Chinese people returned home for the Lunar New Year, many will have been dreading the family interrogations that so often accompany the festivities. Do you have a boyfriend? How much money do you make? When will you get married and have children? Why don\\'t you move home and work for Big Uncle? And why, why, why are you so fat? The pressure to settle down and start popping out offspring can be such that many young Chinese people rent actors -- for upwards of $200 a night -- to pretend to be their romantic partner through the Spring Festival holiday period, which ends Saturday, and help them stave off awkward questions. \"Young people are delaying marriage, but their parents still use the old standard to ask them to get married and have children \\'on time\\',\" said Yue Qian, an assistant professor at the University of British Columbia. These pressures lie behind the success of a viral video in the run up to the vacation. \"A Spring Festival Survival Guide,\" has attracted more than a million views on various platforms in the past month, including over 300,000 on YouTube, which is blocked in mainland China, showing that family pressures don\\'t care about international borders. The song is both a pastiche of traditional Spring Festival stresses, and a rip-roaring anthem to individualism, ending with the defiant chorus: Encore The success of \"Survival Guide\" -- called \"What I Do Is For Your Own Good\" in English -- is even more surprising given its source, not some Chinese popstar or viral video factory, but a traditional chamber choir. The Rainbow Chamber Singers (RCS) were founded in 2010 by conductor Jin Chengzhi and a small group of his fellow students at the prestigious Shanghai Conservatory of Music. The choir puts on a concert every six months, performing old favorites and newly written traditional-style choral pieces. Since 2016, Jin has also been mixing it up with his own compositions, which mix serious music with comedic lyrics and social commentary. \"Where On Earth Did You Leave the Key, Zhang Shichao?\" a kazoo-heavy castigation of ungrateful roommates, was the choir\\'s first major hit, Jin said. They followed it with \"So Far, the Sofa is So Far,\" an anthem for China\\'s \"overtime dogs,\" the millions of underpaid millennials working long hours for abusive bosses. The choir\\'s music deals with stresses common to young people, said Eric Fish, author of \"China\\'s Millennials,\" and growing levels of rebellion against them. \"Young people are steadily pushing back against pressures to get married quickly and gun for the most stable and lucrative job,\" Fish said. Jin -- who describes himself as a \"rational optimist\" -- said that his work comes from his own experiences and anxieties, but that he hopes the songs \"can bring people understanding and hope for life.\" \"Though \\'So Far, the Sofa is So Far\\' describes the miserable overtime life of working young people, the core of the song is that you should choose your own lifestyle,\" he said. \"These conflicts are worth discussing because they are happening right now in our daily lives. No matter if it\\'s working overtime or the generation gap, I think we are responsible for society and can make young people\\'s voices heard.\" Diversity Choral music in China can be quite conservative, with many people\\'s experience being limited to groups that sing so-called \"red songs,\" music that dates back to the founding of the People\\'s Republic or the Cultural Revolution and which is often heavy on Communist ideology and references to Mao Zedong. The Rainbow Chamber Singers, on the other hand, are keen to reinvent the genre. \"Good music must be diverse,\" Jin said. \"If you stick to something for no reason, the art will lose its original charm.\" Their approach has proved a hit with audiences of all ages. \"Once after a performance, four old ladies in their seventies from Anhui were waiting backstage for my autograph,\" Jin said. \"That moved me a lot.\" Speaking out As they become more assertive and influential, China\\'s millennials are producing and consuming pop culture that speaks to their concerns and helps spread a feeling of solidarity about certain issues. \"There have been all sorts of media articles, personal accounts and memes in the past few years relating to overbearing family pressure,\" Fish said. \"I think these reflect a growing frustration among young people with antiquated attitudes towards life.\" In this sense, he added, the choir\\'s song acts as \"a rallying cry to stand up and resist.\" \"Underlying the growing visibility of the pressures (placed on them) is also the young generation\\'s growing self-expression,\" said Yue. \"It\\'s not necessarily rebellion. I think the younger generation want to communicate with the older generation and hope (they) can understand their worldviews and life choices.\" And at least in Jin\\'s case, one family has gotten the message: \"My relatives all heard \\'What I Do Is For Your Own Good.\\' So I had a very comfortable Spring Festival.\"'],\n",
       " ['No joke: 6 times comedy changed the way we live nan But those on the listening end don\\'t always agree. Take what happened to comedic screen siren Mae West in 1926 after she dared to write and star in a Broadway play titled \"Sex\": She was sentenced to 10 days in a woman\\'s workhouse and fined $500 on obscenity charges. Of course, times change. Some 70 years later, there was so much \"Sex\" happening in the city that an entire television series was devoted to it. As comedian Patton Oswalt puts it in CNN\\'s \"The History of Comedy,\" \" \\'Off limits\\' is not a permanent address. You couldn\\'t say \\'pregnant\\' on TV when Lucille Ball was pregnant on \\'I Love Lucy.\\' So to anyone who says, \\'Well, it\\'s off limits\\' ... enjoy the next 10 minutes because that\\'s about as long as that\\'s going to last.\" Like mischievous children, comedians have long pushed boundaries to see what they can get away with. And if it weren\\'t for the Mae Wests of the world, we may never have had the cultural breakthroughs that led us to where we are today. Here are six times when comedy broke barriers, shocked audiences and, in the process, changed the way we live. 1. Lenny Bruce convicted of \\'word crimes\\' When: 1964 What happened: When Bruce came along in the 1950s, he stunned audiences with his unfiltered routines about drugs, race and religion. His material outraged the era\\'s moral crusaders, who banned Bruce from several cities and tried to shut down his act. In 1964, undercover police secretly recorded Bruce performing at a New York club and arrested him on obscenity charges. At his trial, despite testimony on his behalf from Woody Allen, Bob Dylan and others, a Manhattan court convicted Bruce of \"word crimes\" and sentenced him to a workhouse. The verdict derailed Bruce\\'s career, and he died in 1966. A famous line: Why it matters: Can you imagine a world in which Louis C.K., Eddie Murphy or Margaret Cho would be arrested on obscenity charges for their stand-up? \"Lenny opened the doors for the comics today,\" George Carlin, another influencer on this list, told CNN in 1990. \"He made it possible to think that someone could even be funny that way.\" 2. George Carlin\\'s 7 dirty words When: 1972 What happened: Carlin began doing a monologue in his stand-up act called \"Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television.\" The words: sh*t, p*ss, f**k, c*nt, c**ksucker, motherf**ker and t*ts. After Carlin did the bit onstage at a festival in Milwaukee, he was arrested and the monologue was played at his trial, drawing giggles in the courtroom (a judge tossed out the case). The next year, a man complained to the Federal Communications Commission that his young son had heard Carlin\\'s routine on the radio, sparking a dispute that went all the way to the US Supreme Court. A famous line: Why it matters: The Supreme Court ruled that Carlin\\'s joke was \"indecent but not obscene,\" upholding free speech while also giving federal authorities the power to restrict offensive broadcasts when children are likely to be watching or listening. Asked later about his profane style of comedy, Carlin said, \"I like to find out where the line is drawn, and then drag the audience across the line with me and make them happier for the experience.\" 3. Norman Lear\\'s sitcoms reinvent TV When: Early 1970s What happened: Lear broke the existing TV sitcom mold when he created \"All in the Family.\" The series, which revolved around the insult-spewing bigot Archie Bunker, tackled the sweeping changes of the era with such honesty that CBS ran an onscreen disclaimer before the first episodes. By balancing comedy with thorny issues like racism, homosexuality, menopause and misogyny, \"All in the Family\" became the No. 1 show on TV and inspired several spinoffs, including \"Maude.\" That show broke ground of its own by airing a two-part 1972 episode about the main character\\'s decision to get an abortion. A famous scene: Why it matters: \"TV only started to become socially relevant in the early 1970s,\" said Robert J. Thompson, founding director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University. \"The norm before that was more likely to be talking horses and flying nuns.\" 4. Richard Pryor gets provocative about race When: Early-to-mid-1970s What happened: While some comedians avoided joking about race, Pryor tackled the topic head-on in electric stand-up performances. Pryor wasn\\'t afraid to make whites feel uncomfortable by mocking racist behavior with thinly veiled anger, and he was one of the first comedians to make liberal use of the N-word. Editor\\'s Note: The following video contains graphic language and content. Viewer discretion is advised. \"This one night I decided to make it my own,\" he said of the racial slur. \"I decided to take the sting out of it ... as if saying it over and over again would numb me and everybody else to its wretchedness.\" A famous line: Why it matters: Pryor inspired almost every black comic who followed him, including Eddie Murphy, Bernie Mac, Damon Wayans and Chris Rock. \"Richard basically blazed a trail for black comedy. He defined what it is,\" Wayans told The Washington Post in 1998. \"As a young black man he was saying what he felt -- and that was shocking.\" 5. Ellen comes out When: 1997 What happened: Two weeks after comedian Ellen DeGeneres came out as gay on the cover of Time magazine, her \"Ellen\" character came out in a two-part episode of the ABC sitcom (titled \"The Puppy Episode\" after the network\\'s suggestion that her seemingly asexual character get a puppy to boost slumping ratings). The fallout was swift and severe. Some companies pulled their ads, and an affiliate in Birmingham, Alabama, refused to air the episode. Guest star Laura Dern, who played a lesbian, said she had trouble getting work afterward. But the episode drew huge ratings, and 20 years later it\\'s hard to imagine what the fuss was about. A famous line: Why it matters: DeGeneres\\' was the first lead character to come out as gay on American television, and her example helped usher in major LGBT characters in \"Will & Grace,\" \"Glee\" and other series. 6. \\'South Park\\' skewers sacred cows When: 1997-present What happened: From the very first episode of this subversive cartoon, titled \"Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,\" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone seemed bent on offending as many groups as possible. Over the years the show has gleefully lampooned conservatives and liberals, satirized Jesus Christ and Mohammed, made insinuations about Tom Cruise\\'s sexuality, depicted Steve Irwin with a stingray barb stuck in his chest and called Scientology a \"big, fat global scam.\" Editor\\'s Note: The following video contains graphic language and content. Viewer discretion is advised. In one episode the word \"sh*t\" was said 162 times, complete with a helpful counter that tallied the utterances in the lower-left corner of the screen. Because the show airs on Comedy Central, not broadcast TV, it has been largely spared the wrath of network censors. Still, numerous parents\\' and conservative groups have called for boycotts. A famous line: Why it matters: By skillfully skewering religion, ethnic groups, celebrities and other targets while pushing the bounds of decency, \"South Park\" has largely obliterated TV\\'s last remaining taboos. Almost no topic, no matter how sensitive, has been immune. Thompson, the Syracuse University professor, compared such trailblazing comedy to the pioneers who pushed west in the 1800s to tame the American wilderness. \"The wilderness is now closed,\" he said, \"and sometime in the \\'90s we hit the Pacific Ocean.\"'],\n",

       " ['Your hotel room photos could help catch sex traffickers Join the CNN Freedom Project on March 14 2017 for #MyFreedomDay -- a day-long event when students around the world will be holding events to raise awareness of modern slavery. For investigators attempting to track down sex traffickers and their victims, these online advertisements can contain critical clues. The smallest of details in a room could give away its location, but there are too many ads for law enforcement to scan each of them for clues. That\\'s where TraffickCam comes in. It\\'s a simple phone app that uses crowdsourced snapshots of hotel rooms to help law enforcement locate victims and prosecute sex traffickers. Any travelers pit stopping at a hotel can turn on their phone\\'s GPS location and upload photos of the room from four different angles to TraffickCam\\'s database. The idea is that law enforcement agencies can then check adverts featuring suspected trafficking victims in hotel rooms against TraffickCam\\'s database of photos. Stand up to modern slavery on March 14 -- #MyFreedomDay TraffickCam\\'s image analysis tools transform the photos into a number of data points, using features such as patterns on the carpet, paintings on the wall and landmarks out of the window. The various data points in the photos play an important role in matching the location. TraffickCam is the brainchild of Exchange Initiative and a team of researchers at Washington University. Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph provided a $100,000 matching grant to begin development of the app, and private donations are made through the non-profit St. Louis Community Foundation. \"This is an easy way for citizens to take a stand against sex trafficking by simply taking photos,\" Kimberly Ritter, director for development for Exchange Initiative, tells CNN. Since launching in June 2016, Ritter says that more than 150,000 hotels have been added to the TraffickCam database. \"We have over 100,000 people using the app right now, and we\\'re hoping that more will join us to take action and fight this fight,\" she says. Tracing the traffickers But even if the database identifies the location of a hotel room, Ritter says it is \"luck of the draw\" whether the victim is still there. This is because traffickers often post photographs from one location to advertise services in another, she explains. Another strategy is for traffickers to base themselves in a central location and post ads in multiple cities. They then drive the girls to different cities, depending on where they get responses to the ads. \"Local girls that are working locally with local pimps will be using local photos, the majority of the time,\" Sergeant Adam Kavanaugh, supervisor of the St. Louis County Multi-Jurisdictional Human Trafficking Task Force, tells CNN. In these cases Kavanaugh imagines TraffickCam could help investigators identify the hotel to prepare an effective sting operation. But when it comes to tracking down what Kavanaugh calls the \"travelers\" -- trafficking victims that are moved all around the United States -- the app may be more useful in showing movement across state lines. \"We can then make a federal case because of the inter-state commerce,\" says Kavanaugh. This could result in a longer sentence for a convicted trafficker. Putting TraffickCam to the test Before the app can be rolled out to law enforcement agencies across the United States, it is being tested by Kavanaugh and the St. Louis County Police Department. \"Right now we\\'re just beta testing the St Louis area, and we\\'re getting positive hits,\" he says, referring to ads that match hotel room photos in the database. Following initial testing in this small area, Kavanaugh feels optimistic about the role TraffickCam can play in identifying both hotel rooms and routes traffickers are using. \"Technology drives everything we do nowadays, and this is just one more tool that law enforcement can use to make our job a little safer and a little bit easier,\" he says. Ritter hopes the app will be available to all law enforcement in the US by Spring 2017, and will eventually be available worldwide. \"With this being such new and cutting-edge technology, we need to perfect it here in the States and then we\\'ll look to making it globally accessible,\" says Ritter. Global users can already download the app and upload photos to the database. Ritter says that all photographs uploaded on TraffickCam from all over the world are being stored for future use. Why hotels? The US National Human Trafficking Hotline found hotels and motels to be a common venue for sex trafficking, with nearly 10 percent of known trafficking cases reported to them in 2016 taking place in a hotel or motel -- although Polaris, which operates the hotline, believes the real figure is much higher. Just under 10 percent of cases were commercial-front brothels, and in nearly eight percent of cases the venue was unknown. Less than five percent of cases were street-based. The app will only be able to narrow in on exact locations if enough photos are added to the database, but Ritter firmly believes people will continue to add them. \"It\\'s amazing how many people are interested in fighting this atrocity,\" she says. \"The more of us that join together to fight this crime, the better the opportunity we have to eradicate it.\"'],\n",
       " ['The Kelly twins: Revealing the secrets of the human body in space (CNN)The dangers of space exploration are all too clear. Last month, we observed the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 1 disaster, when a cabin fire during launch rehearsals claimed the lives of all three crew. It was a dreadful start in NASA\\'s quest to reach the moon. January 28 marked 21 years since space shuttle Challenger broke up 73 seconds into its flight, killing all seven aboard. Last week, NASA commemorated the lives of seven crew members who perished 14 years ago when space shuttle Columbia disintegrated above Earth during its re-entry. Even on successful missions, crews face a multitude of issues in space. Astronauts aboard the International Space Station are exposed to radiation levels 10 times that of Earth, leading to increased cancer risks. Seventy-nine percent of astronauts are affected by space motion sickness. The heart deconditions; the immune system weakens; bones lose minerals and density at a rate of 1% per month. Fluids redistribute themselves around the body and away from the legs, and for older astronauts, near vision deteriorates. It goes without saying that astronauts are made of stern stuff. Now retired, Capt. Scott Kelly and Shuttle Commander Mark Kelly are two of a select bunch to leave our planet and put everything on the line in doing so, not for the betterment of themselves but for mankind. For that reason, above all, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta has chosen the identical twins for the CNN series \"My Hero.\" \"It\\'s easy to look at it in retrospect and say \\'that was a really cool thing that you did,\\' but the reality is that they had to take a lot of chances,\" Gupta said. \"They had to take a lot of risks. They had to say goodbye to their family and friends and with not the clear understanding that they\\'d ever see them again. \"That\\'s a really hard thing to do in the pursuit of trying to learn something for all of humanity.\" Mark Kelly was selected as an astronaut in 1996, flying in four missions from 2001 to 2011 aboard Endeavor and Discovery. He visited the ISS four times and clocked over 50 days in space. Kelly\\'s final mission, the last flight of the space shuttle Endeavor, took place as his wife, then-Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, recovered from an assassination attempt in January 2011. Also selected for the space program in 1996, Scott Kelly took part in four missions from 1999 to 2016, the first and second aboard NASA shuttles, the third and fourth on Russian Soyuz spacecraft. He totaled 520 days off Earth, the second highest of any astronaut. It was Scott\\'s last mission that would unite the twins, who never went into space at the same time. In November 2012, Scott was chosen to participate in the One-Year Mission, a year-long stay aboard the ISS with cosmonaut Mikhail Korniyenko. The purpose of the mission, to discover more about the long-term effects of space on the human body, required extensive testing of Scott aboard the ISS. But to strengthen the results, the test also required a control subject. Enter Mark. Part of NASA\\'s Human Research Program, the Twins Study was formed of the Kelly twins along with ten researchers, who analyzed samples from Mark and Scott taken before, during and after the mission. Their initial findings, first released January 26, have begun shedding light on the transformations the body undergoes when in space. At a biological level, the team found a decline in bone formation during the second half of Scott\\'s mission, as well as altered gene expression and increased levels of a metabolite in his gut. But the body\\'s response to a flu jab remained the same in orbit, while a \"space gene\" -- a hypothetical change to Scott\\'s genome sequence, triggered by space -- continues to elude scientists (they\\'re still looking). Part of the Twins Study involved tests measuring body response, posture and dexterity. The thrust behind the move is to see how the human body will fare on a six month journey to Mars -- and how fit astronauts will be when they reach the planet. The Functional Task Test found no substantial difference between the results of astronauts in space for six months and a year. However reaction time and accuracy decreased in microgravity. Ahead of a full report due this year, John Charles, chief scientist at the Human Research Program, said in a statement that the results \"have not identified any show-stoppers for longer human spaceflight missions.\" The race for Mars is well and truly on. \"Probably the biggest impediment to just going (to Mars) is the cost,\" Scott said in September, adding that if that could be overcome, the technology would follow. He also said he\\'d put himself forward for the three-year mission. With a bevy of data on Scott\\'s body in space, it would be hard to discount the retired astronaut. As well as an exploratory mission, the venture could lay the groundwork for something more profound. \"NASA believes in redundant systems, and Earth is a system, so if at some point it became feasible to maybe make Mars somewhat like Earth, then there would be a lot of value to that,\" Scott said. \"We don\\'t know how climate\\'s going to affect this planet that we live on,\" Gupta argued. \"We need to start thinking about other places in the universe that we may have to live one day. In order to understand how to do that, we\\'ve got to understand what it\\'s going to do to us first.\" That\\'s why, in the long term, the Twins Study -- and the sacrifices of Mark and Scott Kelly -- is so important. When the full report comes out this year, we\\'ll be one step closer to the Martian surface -- and perhaps a new home for us all.'],\n",
       " ['Elizabeth Warren, we feel your pain Mel Robbins is a CNN commentator, legal analyst, best-selling author and keynote speaker. She also is a contributing editor for Success magazine. In 2014, she was named outstanding news talk-radio host by the Gracie Awards. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. Every woman has experienced something like this: being ignored in a meeting, not included in a client dinner, interrupted while speaking, told she\\'s being \"emotional\" when she disagrees or feels strongly about something, passed over for opportunities, or asked to grab the snacks for the meeting. I recently listened to a panel of female CFOs warn an audience of thousands of women about these daily hits a woman can face as she climbs the ladder. One executive in her late 50s, the CFO of a $400 million company, recounted the time she was asked to take notes during a meeting with her male colleagues. It happened last year. (\"I laughed and said no,\" she said.) If you think this type of behavior is a fast receding relic of an earlier time when older white men ruled the country, you\\'d be wrong. It\\'s actually a sign of the times: Listen to Sen. Lindsey Graham crow that silencing Warren was \"long overdue.\" Or former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee tweet about \"Sen. Warren aka \\'scold.\\'\" This kind of everyday sexism is not getting scrubbed from the culture as we \"advance\" -- it\\'s getting worse and girls internalize this at a very young age. Recent research showed that at the age of five, girls were more likely to guess that a story about a \"really, really smart person\" was describing a female. By age six, just one year later, girls were more likely to predict that the story was about a male. And if that shift isn\\'t alarming enough, consider that one of the researchers noted that in the past, girls were at least seven before they made this shift. The key to reversing this is teaching confidence to girls and women, who too often silence themselves with the habits of hesitation and self-doubt. Confidence is one of the most important skills you can have in life. Notice, I said skill. For a long time I misunderstood confidence. I thought it was a personality trait or a feeling. It\\'s neither. It\\'s a skill that you develop through deliberate action -- something to be actively encouraged in colleagues and friends, daughters and sisters. Confidence is the ability to \"hear\" your own ideas and lean into them -- to raise your hand, raise your standards, raise your concerns and raise your voice. To persist -- knowing that whether you succeed or fail, are criticized or applauded, you\\'ll survive. The more you act, the more competency builds and it gets easier to put yourself out there the next time. Research shows that it\\'s the most confident people who are the most admired, listened to, and highly regarded. For women, this is acutely important. In one study, managers cited \"lack of confidence\" as the primary reason not to promote a woman, yet they didn\\'t feel comfortable telling her. Elizabeth Warren is a woman who displays tremendous confidence. As a senator, she is fearless and unwavering in her questioning and an excellent example of one of my favorite quotes from activist Maggie Kuhn: \"Speak your mind -- even if your voice shakes.\" Warren is one of the few people who isn\\'t afraid of crossing Donald Trump, at every turn. Perhaps that\\'s why it struck such a chord to see her get interrupted, berated and silenced by McConnell as she tried to read from Coretta Scott King\\'s letter on the Senate floor. Yes, she apparently violated an arcane rule, but why then were her male colleagues able to read from the letter uninterrupted? Sen. Tom Udall read it in its entirety. Of course, the line from Mitch McConnell says it all -- she was warned and \"nevertheless, she persisted\" --giving rise to the trending hashtag #ShePersisted. But persist is exactly what we and all of our daughters need to do to succeed. Despite what they say about you or how much you doubt yourself, persist. On a practical level here is how to do this: Speak, even when your voice shakes. No one can take your confidence away from you. Only you can do that. You don\\'t have to feel ready or think you\\'re the kind of \"person who would do such a thing.\" You can. Just ask Rosa Parks. She gave a remarkable interview on Pacifica radio a month after her historic act of civil disobedience. She was described by all as a quiet and shy woman, and in fact viewed herself the same way. In the interview she said she didn\\'t think she was \"capable of doing such a thing.\" She sure was. Take the action -- and your mind will follow. That\\'s confidence -- the decision to bet on yourself. Warren may have been shut down on the Senate floor, but she didn\\'t shut up. She spoke up. \"The Republicans took away my right to read this letter on the floor -- so I\\'m right outside, reading it now,\" she said in a Facebook live video immediately after McConnell silenced her -- and then she did what he tried to prevent her from doing: Read the letter from Coretta Scott King. The video has almost 7.5 million views -- crushing the number of people who watched the Sessions\\' hearing on C-Span. Thanks to her confidence, everyone is now talking about this topic. That is the message that should be heard by women everywhere -- if it matters to you, persist. Confidence isn\\'t about what other people say or do. It\\'s about what you say and do. We women and all of our daughters need to say and do a lot more, and a lot more often.'],\n",
       " ['With Trump, the buck stops there -- or anywhere else (CNN)It was Harry Truman \"?as History 101 shows \"?who famously placed \"The Buck Stops Here\" sign on his desk. The meaning was crystal clear: The president makes the decisions, and bears full responsibility for them. In this young presidency, there seems to be a new slogan: The buck stops ... there. Or anywhere else, actually. If the White House loses its immigration case before the courts, blame the judges. And if there\\'s some sort of attack, it\\'s their fault, too. Trump tweets: \"If something happens, blame him (the Washington state judge) and court system.\" Likewise, if there was confusion at airports worldwide, don\\'t blame the President\\'s hastily arranged travel ban rollout, blame a Delta computer outage, protesters and, of course, the tears of Democratic leader Sen. Chuck Schumer. And what about the actual decision to sign the executive order? Instead of owning it, the President made it clear that, well, he wanted to take more time on implementation, but \"the law enforcement people\" told him otherwise. \"So I wanted to give like a month, then I said, well what about a week? They said well then you\\'re going to have a whole pile of people -- perhaps, perhaps -- with very evil intentions coming in before the restrictions. So there it is folks, it\\'s as plain as you can have it.\" In other words, don\\'t look at me; I\\'m just the President. And speaking of presidents, when was the last time one went out of his way to stoke fear about a possible terror attack? How about Wednesday, when Donald Trump made the case that he knows much more than the public does (as one would expect) and therefore knows we should be very afraid, especially without the travel ban. \"Believe me,\" he said at a session with law enforcement officials. \"I\\'ve learned a lot in the last two weeks, and terrorism is a far greater threat than the people of our country understand.\" Spreading fear may be a part of a deliberate strategy to encourage support for the ban, but that\\'s a campaign strategy. It doesn\\'t sit well in the oval office. Perhaps there is much more to learn. After all, the President\\'s connection to government, and public service, isn\\'t a long thread. Previously, his link to politics has been buying the favor of public servants, as he told us many times during the campaign. What\\'s more, he has not even been the CEO of a publicly held corporation. He\\'s been the chairman of a private family business, surrounding himself with those indebted to him, and blood relatives. (Paging: Ivanka Trump and Nordstrom) Suddenly, the President finds himself in a world in which he faces co-equal branches of government and foreign leaders who are responsive to public opinion in their own countries, rather than to his opinion. (Exception: Friend Vladimir Putin) In business, Trump is king. So while he may understand the separation of powers, he simply rejects the notion. In his view, the 9th Circuit judges were \"disgraceful\" when they interrogated lawyers. In fact, the very idea that the branches of government don\\'t simply salute when the President wants to do something is anathema to him, considering what he has known his whole life. It\\'s not disgraceful; it\\'s democracy. Just ask Judge Gorsuch.'],\n",
       " ['White House\\'s own terrorism list torpedoes the case for travel ban Peter Bergen is CNN\\'s national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the author of \"United States of Jihad: Investigating America\\'s Homegrown Terrorists.\" Conspicuous by their absence on the White House list of terrorists carrying out major attacks against Western targets were Iraqis, Somalis, Sudanese and Yemenis, who are from four of the seven Muslim countries that the Trump administration is seeking to suspend travel from. (Note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly said there were no Libyans on the White House list of attackers. This article has been updated to reflect the omission.) Instead, the incidents listed on the White House terrorism list identified France, the United States and Belgium as the countries supplying the most anti-Western terrorists.  With great fanfare on Monday the White House released a list of 78 terrorist attacks since September 2014. A White House official described them as \"major terrorist attacks targeting the West.\"  The list was released after President Trump\\'s claim that the media is under-covering terrorist attacks, a contention that is not borne out by the evidence. The White House\\'s own terrorism list underlines the arbitrary nature of the travel ban because, by the White House\\'s own account, the countries that are generating the most significant number of terrorists threatening the West are from the West. The list also underlines the fact that it is American citizens who largely foment terrorism in the United States. This is also the case in countries such as France and Belgium, where it is French and Belgian citizens who are often the ones conducting significant acts of terrorism. Of the total of 90 terrorists on the White House list, at most nine are from travel ban countries. Indeed, 50 of the terrorists \"?more than half -- are from Christian-majority countries in the West. On the list, which includes the identities of attackers where they are known, France leads the way with 16 French terrorists, followed by the United States with 13 American terrorists, 11 of whom are US citizens and two of whom are legal permanent residents. Of these 29 American and French terrorists, only two even have family origins in travel ban countries and they are both from Somalia. Belgium comes in third place with seven terrorists. In descending order after that are: --Tunisians (6), --Libyans and Bengalis are tied with 5, --Saudis (4), --Syrians, Algerians and Indonesians are tied with 3 each; --Afghans, Australians, Bosnians, Canadians, Danes, Germans, Russians and Turks are tied with two each and --One each from Chad, Egypt, the Emirates, Iran, Morocco, the Palestinian Territories, Pakistan, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. These findings may cause a problem for the White House as it makes the argument that citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan and Yemen are particularly likely to foment anti-Western terrorism, when the White House\\'s own terrorism list demonstrates that this is not the case. For example, an unspecified number of Filipinos participated in a botched attempt to blow up a bomb outside the US embassy in Manila last year. In 15 of the 78 attacks the perpetrators have not been identified. I took the White House terrorism list and grouped it by nationalities below.

       " ['In its fight against Putin, Ukraine feels abandoned by the West Michael Bociurkiw is a writer and development professional who has worked on emergencies on several continents, most recently as a spokesman for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. \"The dire situation in eastern Ukraine is one that demands clear and strong condemnation of Russian actions,\" the new US ambassador to the United Nations said. \" ... The United States stands with the people of Ukraine who have suffered for nearly three years under Russian occupation and military intervention. Until Russia and the separatists it supports respect Ukraine\\'s sovereignty and territory integrity this crisis will continue.\" Haley went on to say that the US Crimea-related sanctions will remain in place until Russia returns the Crimean Peninsula to Ukraine. The statement came as a horrific spike in violence was taking place in eastern Ukraine, killing dozens and bringing more than 11,000 explosions in one day alone along the front line, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Haley\\'s tough talk could have come straight out of the Obama administration playbook. But whether the harsh tongue-lashing against Russia reflected the views of the newest occupant of the White House is not entirely clear. Indeed, fast-forward to Sunday and Vice President Mike Pence was telling George Stephanopoulos in an interview that aired on ABC\\'s \"This Week\" that the Trump administration will decide in the coming months whether to lift sanctions against Russia in return for joint action against ISIS and international terrorism. The diplomatic mixed signals could not have happened at a worse time and have left Ukrainian diplomats scrambling for more clarification from the Trump White House. In Kiev, the feeling is that Russian sanctions are the only remaining hammer left in an increasingly ineffective diplomatic toolbox. And should Washington withdraw support for sanctions, it could very well trigger a chain reaction, whereby European Union states such as Italy and Greece follow suit. There are already hints that the Trump administration will lift sanctions, but in a step-by-step process. As violence began to flare in eastern Ukraine, the White House announced it is loosening sanctions imposed by Barack Obama on Russia\\'s Federal Security Service. Could the next step be a reversal of the expulsion of Russian diplomats ordered by Obama in the last days of his presidency? Whatever future action taken by the White House, one thing is abundantly clear: Tensions along the front line in eastern Ukraine have never been higher, and the prospect for a full-blown escalation is real. Both sides have moved plenty of heavy weaponry out of storage and in close proximity to each other. Multiple Launch Rocket Systems, proscribed by the Minsk agreement, are also back in action. The human toll is almost incalculable: Several dozen deaths in the past days have brought the total death toll since the conflict began in 2014 close to 10,000. Most of the action has taken place in the flashpoint industrial city of Avdiivka, home to about 20,000 people and the location of a coke and chemical plant that not only provides heating to the surrounding community but also the raw material for Ukraine\\'s vital steel industry. Alexander Hug, the Deputy Chief Monitor of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said that continued shelling, especially at the coke plant, could trigger a humanitarian and ecological disaster. Also worrisome is that fighting has resumed in previously quiet areas, including those close to the strategic port city of Mariupol. Though the Ukrainian side is far more battle-ready than when the conflict first began, there are real fears the rebel side is positioning to take more ground. After the humiliating fall of Debaltseve, it is unlikely that Kiev will ignore increasing belligerence from the rebel side. If sanctions are lifted, they will likely have no choice but to move toward escalation. This could also lead to anxious and unpredictable actions on the part of Kiev. The clear signal I picked up during a recent visit to Ukraine is that its people are feeling increasingly abandoned and can no longer rely on traditional, international security guarantees. As Ukrainian parliamentarian Nataliya Katser-Buchkovska says, Ukraine needs to hear from the \"guarantors of the Western order\" that it will not be left alone in its battle against outside aggressors. Few people would disagree that the Minsk agreements have had little impact in bringing peace to the battle-weary people of eastern Ukraine. But they are the only markers, signed by all sides, that set standards of behavior in a conflict that has displaced about 3 million and could force many thousands more to flee. Contradictory messages by the White House on Russia could ignite the fuse that pushes this grinding conflict beyond the point of no return.'],\n",

A Michigan retiree expressed his support of a local LGBTQ non-discrimination ordinance by performing a whimsical rap in front of his city\\'s council.- As seen in the video above,-Donald Tassie, 81, received thunderous applause from Jackson residents after taking the mic to back a citywide ordinance that prohibits discrimination-based on sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing and public accommodations Tuesday. The former superintendent at Jackson\\'s da Vinci High School, Tassie deemed himself \"Tr.

We got started and people said things I was going to say,\"?he said. \"there was a part of me that thought it was time for something different, I said, \"Let\\'s try another thing.\"?Tassie said he began getting involved with the local LGBTQ community as an ally after the death of his wife, Tuey, in 2001. Out of all of his friends and family, a lesbian couple, Iris and Dianne, offered him the most support after Tuey\\'s passing, he said.- \"they are my dearest best friends after that,\"?he told Michigan Live. \"how could I deny them, my friends, the same rights that I have?\"?No word on whether or not Tassie\\'s rap swayed their views, but Jackson city council members voted 5-2 in favor of the non-discrimination ordinance.

       " ['An Innocent Man Mike Pence Refused To Pardon Finally Sees Justice Current Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb has pardoned Keith Cooper for what he called a \"wrongful\" conviction. In 1997, a man attempted to snatch a woman\\'s purse in Elkhart, Indiana. Keith Cooper wasn\"t far from the scene of the incident. The 29-year-old had just picked up some groceries for his family and was walking home to make his children breakfast and watch-\"\\x9cX-Men\"?with them. Instead, he found himself in a police station awaiting charges for the purse-snatching.-Then things got worse: A detective with the Elkhart Police Department connected Cooper to an armed robbery at an apartment complex where a shooting took place. \"This is crap,\"?Cooper told the detective at the time, The Indianapolis Star reported. \"I didn\"t do the crime I\\'m going to trial for, let alone this one.\"?Cooper was found innocent of the purse snatching, but convicted of armed robbery. He spent the next 10 years of his life behind bars for a crime he never committed. In 2006, he was finally released from prison after DNA evidence and witness statements proved his innocence.- The Indiana Court of Appeals overturned his conviction, but there was a catch: Cooper could be released immediately with a felony still on his record, or he could face a new trial. Cooper wanted to see his family, so chose to get out as soon as possible. Hoping to be pardoned, Cooper wrote a letter in 2013 to then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R), who is now the U.S. vice president. The Indiana Parole Board recommended in 2014 that Pence grant the pardon. Last September, Pence finally wrote back to Cooper to say he wasn\"t going to pardon him. \"It crushed me a little bit,\"?Cooper, a 49-year-old forklift operator, told the Chicago Tribune.-\"I haven\"t give up hope. My hope is what keeps me strong, but I\\'m human and it hurts.\"?Pence said he wouldn\"t pardon Cooper until he had exhausted all of his options in court. On Thursday,-Gov. Eric Holcomb (R) came to a different conclusion. He gave Cooper his pardon. This morning, I pardoned Keith Cooper. \"After careful and thoughtful consideration and review, something I\"ve thought about every day over the last month, just earlier today I issued a pardon to Mr. Keith Cooper for his past and I believe wrongful armed robbery felony [conviction],\"?Holcomb said, according to the South Bend Tribune. \"since that conviction in 1997 many pieces of the information that were out and about ...-have changed,\"?Holcomb added, noting that \"A victim, an informant, even the deputy prosecutor who convicted Mr. Cooper on that first crime all have stated support or no objection to a pardon.\"?Now, Cooper can focus on his family again. \"I was watching my children grow up through pictures,\"?Cooper told the Indianapolis Star of his time in prison. \"And that\\'s the hardest thing I couldn\"t swallow.\"?,-1\"'],\n",

       " ['Pope Francis Has A Very Clear Message For \\'Christians\\' Who Build Walls Like the one who lives in the White House. Pope Francis appeared to continue his subtle indictment of President Donald Trump-on Wednesday with another passionate appeal. While never directly mentioning Trump or his ban on refugees, Francis renewed his calls for Christians to build bridges, not walls. \"In the social and civil context as well, I appeal not to create walls but to build bridges,\"?he said during a catechism lesson, according to The Associated Press. \"to not respond to evil with evil. To defeat evil with good, the offense with forgiveness. A Christian would never say \"\\x98you will pay for that.\"?Never. \"that is not a Christian gesture. An offense you overcome with forgiveness. To live in peace with everyone.\"?Francis has made statements like this before. After a papal trip to Mexico last year, a reporter asked Francis to comment on Trump\\'s plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and to make Mexico pay for it. In response, Francis said, \"A person who only thinks about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian.\"?The pope\\'s comments on Wednesday coincided with the feast day of-St. Josephine Bakhita, a 19th-century Sudanese woman who was kidnapped, sold into slavery, and eventually traveled to Italy. There, she entered a convent and became a nun. She is the patron saint of Sudan, one of the seven Muslim-majority countries on Trump\\'s travel ban.- Pope Francis hasn\"t directly addressed Trump\\'s executive order, but a senior member of the Vatican hierarchy has expressed the Holy See\\'s-disapproval. Many U.S. Catholic bishops have also spoken out against the order. During his Wednesday address, Francis asked Catholics to pray for Myanmar\\'s Rohingya Muslims refugees, whom human rights groups-believe are being persecuted-by the country\\'s army and police.- \"these are good people, peaceful people,\"?Francis said. \"they\\'r not Christians, but they\\'r good, our brothers and sisters.

       " ['The Absolute Top Ten Best Things to Do in Seattle (The City of the Century) nan Prior to moving to Seattle in 1996, I\\'d lived in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco, and had traveled to many of the major cities of the world. By comparison, Seattle seemed beautiful, but small, provincial, and a little isolated...a pre-teen of a city. But, somehow, in the intervening years, Seattle grew up, came of age, blossomed to full flower. What makes Seattle\\'s leap so unique is that it sprouts from a foundation rooted in the land and the long-held values of its people. Unlike other cities, Seattle seeks diversity and experiences that respect its past, and seed its future. Its evolution is singular, and maps to organic maturation timelines, like a century plant, or a Himalayan lily, or desert sage after a rain. Nothing seems to happen for a long while, and then, all of a sudden, when the timing and conditions are just right: a growth spurt, a brilliant bloom, and a metamorphosis - all enabled by the same DNA. From philanthropy to tech, life sciences to art and architecture; from progressive social initiatives, to sustainability, and even from coffee, craft beer, and ground-breaking dining, Seattle not just bends the light today, but thrusts it to a better future. I now live in Los Angeles, and have for a decade, but I head back to Seattle regularly to see my eldest son and old friends, and each time I am pleasantly shocked by how much fruit the city has borne. It is a city worth seeing. It may be the city of the century. So, after probing about, and asking many friends, here are the top ten things to see and do in Seattle today: 1) Seattle Public Library I met the architect Rem Koolhaas in 2003, and he modestly described his design for the Seattle Public Library. When it opened a year later I was dumbfounded. It stands today as one of the most innovative library projects in the world. Of glass and steel, it is 11-stories high, with a stunning original construction, consisting of several discrete \"floating platforms\" seemingly wrapped in a large steel net around glass skin. It can hold about 1.45 million books and other materials, and includes over 400 computers open to the public. Paul Goldberger, writing in The New Yorker, declared the Seattle Central Library \"the most important new library to be built in a generation, and the most exhilarating.\" My favorite section of the building is the \"Books Spiral,\" (designed to display the library\\'s nonfiction collection without breaking up the Dewey Decimal System classification onto different floors or sections). The collection spirals up through four stories on a continuous series of shelves. This allows visitors to peruse the entire collection without using stairs or traveling to a different part of the building. Pretty impressive. Architectural tours of the building are offered daily. 2) Mbar The Damask rose of city restaurants is the newly opened rooftop mbar, a dialectic with a view, virtuoso fare, and a purpose. I supped recently with proceeds going to help Syrian refugees, so the experience had heightened meaning. You can see the future here (the space sprawls the 14th floor; two-thirds of it outside). Amazon, in all its glory, has a flock of cranes crafting new buildings as you dine, and beyond is the backdrop of the Space Needle, the MoPop museum, South Lake Union, and much of the Seattle skyline. Syrian-born Wassef Haroun and his wife, Racha, own mbar, and have infused it with hints of their Middle Eastern backgrounds, but the magic is performed by Top Chef alum Jason Stratton. He has authored a menu filled with Northwest ingredients enhancing dishes that span the map from Italy to Lebanon to China. If there is one restaurant to experience while visiting Seattle, this is it. 3) The Theo Chocolate Factory Tour Everyone in my family dies for chocolate, so this is a fav. In the Fremont neighborhood, not far from the infamous sculpture of a troll beneath the Aurora Bridge, is Theo Chocolate, a Willy Wonka-esque golden ticket offering up one of the most delicious factory tours outside of cinema. Silver pipes flowing with chocolate are everywhere. Everybody dons a hair net to keep it all as sanitary as possible. The tour dives into the history of cocoa, including the transformation of the football-sized cocoa fruit into eatable decadence. The Latin name for the cacao fruit is Theobroma cacao, which means \\'Food of the Gods.\\' The tour also features the social and environmental issues related to cocoa and cocoa farmers. Theo Chocolate was the first U.S. company to make organic fair trade chocolate, with payments to farmers 2-3 times higher than the market rate. The first half hour of the tour is seated; the second is a guided walk where you witness the magic transmutation of bean to bar. It\\'s a bit like a coffee factory or micro-brewery, in that the process goes from giant tubs of beans into an array of machines, including winnowers, roasters, mixers, mills, and refiners. Of course, you exit through the gift shop, but this is one time when the detour is welcome. 4) Museum of Pop Culture (n¨¦e Experience Music Project) This began as a vanity tribute to Jimi Hendrix, conceived and marshalled by uber-fan Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder and billionaire club member. He hired Frank Gehry, who bent the sheet-metal exterior to look like liquid music, or a smashed guitar, depending upon your perspective. When it opened in 2000, it was controversial, to say the least...some saw it as a blight on the land. New York Times architecture critic Herbert Muschamp described it as \"something that crawled out of the sea, rolled over, and died.\" But, now it is an icon of the city scape, and a must-see when in town. The outside of the building features a fusion of textures and colors, including gold, silver, deep red, blue and a \"shimmering purple haze.\" The interior is filled with interactive exhibits spanning the range of pop culture, and is worth a full-day exploring. 5) Pike Place Market Often when friends and families visited, my first stop when showing them around was Pike Place Market. Since 1907 this flamboyant waterfront public market has been tossing around its wares. It\\'s a perennial fish-mongers market, a sensory rumpus of foods and flowers, along with gewgaws, gimcracks, bric-a-brac and even objets d\\'art. Merchants enthusiastically pitch salmon to one other, as much for the crowds as for expediency. Down the stairs is a vintage Starbucks, claiming to be the original. 6) Duckboat Tour I took my 8-year-old son on a Duckboat Tour, and he quacked up with delight. One of the best parts of these tours is the non-stop bill of bad jokes and banter issued by the driver/guide. The yellow contraptions are restored World War II amphibious vehicles, and they pass many of the great sites of the city before plunging into Lake Union for a paddle around the lake, past the famous houseboat of \"Sleepless in Seattle\" fame. No down about it; it\\'s big fun. 7) Mount Si One of my first outdoor excursions when I moved to the Seattle area was climbing Mount Si, a short drive east of the Microsoft campus, where I worked. I was testing a new communications satellite system for use in Africa, and needed altitude and a clear landscape, so took the 4-mile vertical hike. From the summit, I could see clear across Seattle to the Olympic Mountains. I went on to trek the peak another dozen times, sometimes with my then infant son on my shoulders, sometimes up and back before a summer brunch. It is one of the most satisfying urban hikes anywhere. 8) Space Needle It\\'s a classic, but still tops the list. My elder sister attended the 1962 World\\'s Fair, and came back telling tall tales of the rotating spaceship that scrapes the sky. Then I saw the 1974 Warren Beatty film, The Parallax View, which features the Space Needle in a critical scene, and I knew I had to make the pilgrimage. It doesn\\'t disappoint. The Pacific Science Center at its base has a Children\\'s Museum, two IMAX theaters, a tropical butterfly house, and now a Chihuly glass display (another connection...I was the minister who married Dale Chihuly and his wife Leslie some years back). When Expedia went public, we celebrated on top at the Skycity Restaurant, and I arranged for an Expedia-logoed seaplane to circle around us. 9) Tillicum Village One of my favorite excursions with family and friends is the tour to Tillicum Village, on tiny Blake Island, reached by a short boat ride across Puget Sound. It offers up a dinner of alder wood-roasted salmon and an evening of ancient Salish stories told by dancers in traditional native wooden masks all inside a huge cedar longhouse. The island was the birthplace of Chief Sealth in 1786, for whom Seattle was named. Today the traditional longhouse, where dinner and the show are presented, is awash in artwork from Washington and Alaska coastal tribes. Dinner begins with clams in nectar followed by fire-roasted salmon and venison stew. The four-hour cruise to the meal and show leaves from Pier 55 in downtown Seattle, but it is also possible to kayak over, and then camp for the night in the 475-acre park, with a sparkling backdrop of the Seattle skyline. 10) Woodinville Wine Tour (A Place Beyond the Vines) With the rise of Seattle comes success and money, and with success and money, comes wine. When I first moved to Seattle in 1996, there was little in the way of a wine industry, the exception being Chateau Ste. Michelle, opened in 1976. Now, less than a half-hour drive from downtown Seattle, there are nearly 100 wineries, wine bars, tasting rooms, cooking and wine pairing classes, and they can be sampled in a host of tours, from vans, to self-drive to bicycles to limos. Most are in the bushy hamlet of Woodinville, and almost all get their juice from Eastern Washington\\'s fabled growing regions. It sits at the northern tip of the Sammamish Valley, a cradle for local farms with beautiful flowers, lavender, and fabulous fresh produce. And there is live music almost every night. Washington is the second biggest wine-producer in the country but exports only 1% of its wine. Note, it\\'s impossible to hit all the pourings in a day, but worth the try. The Director\\'s Cut'],\n",
       " ['Bernie Sanders Has A Massive Email List. But He Has Good Reason To Think Twice About Sharing It. Sanders has his hands on a coveted form of political currency. WASHINGTON \"?In the course of his unexpectedly popular run for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) amassed a huge network of supporters \"?along with their email addresses and other personal information. Now Democrats are gunning for access to that list, which is estimated to include millions of people. An email list may sound like an arcane item to become the focus of a battle for the party\\'s future. But access to a large list of enthusiastic liberals would allow candidates and campaigns to mobilize thousands of activists and donors at a moment\\'s notice. In short, the \"list\"?has become a coveted form of political currency in the digital era. The question for Sanders is whether he should share his data, and if so, how he should go about doing it, according to experts in the list-building systems that have become a cornerstone of contemporary political organizing. If the goal is for Sanders to provide the party greater access to his base, the most logical entity with which to share his list is the Democratic National Committee, the party\\'s main national organ. And right now the DNC is in the midst of a seven-way competition between the major candidates who would like to become its next chair. The Sanders campaign\\'s email list is now housed at Our Revolution, a political action committee Sanders set up to continue the work of his presidential campaign. And Shannon Jackson, Our Revolution\\'s executive director, said he doesn\"t want to just hand that list over to the Democratic National Committee, since Our Revolution is committed to remaining independent from the party. For his part, Sanders told The Washington Post that he would \"Cross that bridge\"?when the DNC race is settled. Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), who is Sanders\"?preferred candidate to chair the DNC and the owner of his own large email list, suggested Sanders should grant party leadership access to the list. If elected chair, Ellison would \"Absolutely\"?ask the Vermont senator to share his powerful campaign list, Ellison said at a HuffPost-sponsored DNC candidate debate on Jan. 18. Our Revolution\\'s Jackson declined to comment on Ellison\\'s statement, but reiterated that his organization supports Ellison\\'s candidacy.-Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said in a statement that \"where has been no discussion with the DNC about use of the list.\"?Some diehard Sanders backers aren\"t so into the idea. \"If they wanted the Democratic Party to have their information, they would have given it to them by now,\"?one such fan wrote in a scathing criticism of Ellison\\'s remarks.- List sharing always poses risks. And in this case, the matter is especially sensitive. Many Sanders supporters are still angry with the DNC for what they saw as unfair intervention on behalf of Hillary Clinton in the primary. Those supporters would likely only support the most progressive political candidates and causes, and would not want to hear from the DNC as it tries to raise money or turn out activists for anything that doesn\"t meet their standards. Jackson said Our Revolution has already had to reassure many active members that it is not sharing data or otherwise colluding with the DNC. People have contacted the organization with accusations of unwanted collaboration on several occasions, typically when Our Revolution has mobilized members to take action for Ellison or other candidates it has endorsed in battles for control of local Democratic parties, he said. There is not a particularly long tradition of individual candidates with large email lists sharing them with the party. Organizing for America, a 501(c)(4)-former President Barack Obama created out of his 2008 presidential campaign, and its post-2012 successor, Organizing for Action, inherited the Obama campaign\\'s successful email list. OFA only shared the list, which numbers in the millions, with the DNC in August 2015. Once the 2016 Democratic primary ended, top Democrats \"?including former Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (Nev.) \"?began talking to Sanders about sharing his list or its data with Clinton\\'s campaign or the DNC. Speculation about the fate of Sanders\"?list has only escalated since November, with some more establishment-friendly Democrats seemingly hoping that putting Ellison in charge of the DNC would ensure access to Sanders\"?base. One Democratic operative, who requested anonymity because he is not authorized to speak on the matter, said this is \"uncharted territory\"?in many ways: \"Bernie was an independent who became a Democrat and built a unique campaign that we haven\"t seen in a very long time.\"?Legally, political organizations or candidates can sell or donate their email lists. It\\'s how you do it that presents the challenge. Donating a list is generally called a \"list swap\"? an organization can trade lists with a like-minded candidate or organization. They can also just sell their list to another organization, which can bring in a lot of money if the list is large or particularly useful. In each example, the organizations decide whether to allow list members to opt in to the new list, or directly add their emails and then let them opt out. Direct adding email addresses and then forcing people to opt out comes with a higher risk of an organization\\'s emails ending up in a spam folder. Internet service providers try to help their customers by sniffing out unwanted email, thereby creating a high barrier to entry for unwanted political solicitations. \"signing people up for email lists without telling them is a very typical way to get marked as spam,\"?said Emily Schwartz, vice president of organizing at NationBuilder, a nonpartisan digital firm that specializes in political campaigns. Jason Rosenbaum, a veteran progressive digital guru and technology director for the Action Network, a nonprofit that builds online organizing tools, recalled excessive spam rates dooming campaigns he has worked on. \"I have seen programs go to zero because they have screwed up with this kind of stuff,\"?he said. Other risks include the prospect of activists disengaging or unsubscribing from an email list, which could lead to attrition \"?for both the DNC and the original Our Revolution list. If Our Revolution chooses to share its list with the DNC, there are ways for the group to leverage its following to benefit the Democratic Party without compromising the trust it enjoys with its members, said Rosenbaum, who previously led online campaigns for the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and Health Care for America Now. One way to do that is to start with joint actions between the two organizations \"?inviting list members to sign a petition, donate money or mobilize around a cause. That would make it abundantly clear to list members that their contact information is being shared with a new organization, rather than forcing it on them. One can envision Our Revolution asking its list members to join an action against Republican cuts to Planned Parenthood funding or attempts to privatize Medicare, for instance. The challenge, however, is ensuring that the DNC does not try to mobilize Our Revolution list members for a candidate or cause they don\"t like. The best insurance against that kind of a mistake \"?and the inevitable blowback \"?is the election of a DNC chair that progressives trust, Rosenbaum suggested. \"the Sanders folks \"?though I think they overstate their case \"?they do have a point about the corruption in the DNC around the primary process,\"?he said. \"If we see a new DNC chair who takes the party in a new direction and is able to make a clean break with the past there in a way that Democratic activists understand, then maybe this type of sharing makes a lot of sense.\"?But Nomiki Konst, a former Sanders campaign surrogate who now works for The Young Turks, a progressive YouTube network, warned Democrats against viewing an email list as a panacea for the party\\'s shortcomings. \"the Democratic Party has to reinvent itself. No Bernie list, no Keith Ellison list, is going to solve that problem,\"?she said. \"the Democratic Party has raised more money than ever, spent more money than ever, and lost more than ever.\"?Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

In \"stranger Things\"?Season 2, things are getting flipped, turned upside down. Everyone, including the cast, has been freaking out since the recent Super Bowl teaser, which seemingly showed Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) alive and a giant monster terrorizing the town of Hawkins, Indiana, but more specific details have been a mystery until now. In new interviews from Entertainment Weekly, we\\'r finally learning what\\'s going down in the upcoming season. Events in the show will begin around one year after Season 1 ended. The boys will be going as Ghostbusters on Halloween. But remember, after coughing up a slug-like creature (possibly a pollywog) in the Season 1 finale, Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) isn\"t doing too well. In fact, co-creator Matt Duffer told EW that Byers seems to be going through post-traumatic stress disorder. \"He seems to be seeing images from the Upside Down \"?the question is whether they\\'r real or not,\"?said Duffer. Elsewhere, Joyce (Winona Ryder) is now going out with an old high-school classmate named Bob (Sean Astin), and Sheriff Hopper (David Harbour) is struggling to cover things up after the craziness in Season 1. \"It kind of falls on Hopper to be the voice of authority to say, \"This did happen and this didn\"t happen,\"?Harbour told EW. \"He\\'s struggling with the compromise that takes him to, having to lie and cover things up.\"?Nancy (Natalia Dyer) and Mike (Finn Wolfhard) are having a tough time at the beginning of the season, too, dealing with the deaths of Barb (Shannon Purser) and, supposedly, Eleven.-Co-creator Ross Duffer said the pair are \"the most screwed up,\"?and we\\'ll see the effects of their trauma.- Besides Joyce\\'s new boyfriend, other new characters include brother-and-sister duo Billy (Dacre Montgomery) and Max (Sadie Sink). The latter is apparently a romantic interest for both Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) and Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo). There\\'s also Dr. Owens (Paul Reiser), who now runs Hawkins Lab. The portal to the Upside Down still exists. But Matt Duffer says the season will contain \"different kinds of horror\"?besides the monsters. It won\"t all be terrifying.

Judith Permar, 56, of Mount Carmel, went to a drop-off box in the town of Natalie at around 2:30 a.m.-Permar was discovered around 8:30 a.m. and pronounced dead at the scene.- The engine on her black Hummer was still running and bags of clothes were scattered near the bin.-A coroner\\'s report said she died from blunt force trauma and hypothermia. Her injuries included a broken arm and wrist. She was reaching into the bin when the step ladder she was standing on collapsed, according to PennLive.com.-- Permar\\'s son told WNEP that she always wanted to help the less fortunate and constantly donated to those clothing bins.

       " ['Voice Search Turns Up the Volume nan By Melissa Mackey, Search Supervisor, gyro Cincinnati Voice search is about to move from a whisper to a shout, quickly. The fact that Google Home and Amazon Echo both had a starring roles in this year\\'s Super Bowl is only the latest of evidence of this fact.- Voice search exploded in 2015, going from \"statistical zero\"?to 10% of all searches globally within the year. By May of 2016, the percent of voice searches doubled to 20%. As voice recognition technology improves, it\\'s no surprise to see voice search skyrocketing. After all, we can speak a lot faster than we type (we speak at 150 wpm, vs 40 wpm for typing). Voice queries are different from typed queries. Let\\'s say you\\'re been looking for a new phone company for your small business, and you\\'r trying to remember the name of the company whose ad you saw on TV the other night. If you\\'r typing, you\\'ll probably search for something like \"business phone companies.\"?With voice search, natural language is more common. You might say something like \"what\\'s the name of the business phone company whose TV ads offered $30 per month?\"?Suddenly, a 3-word query has become a 15-word query, and the intent is much more clear. A few years ago, longer queries were problematic. Search engines struggled with delivering relevant results for voice searches. Search algorithms were built to expect queries of no more than four to five words. But with the growth of voice search, the algorithms have become much better. Not only are search results relevant, but they\\'r personalized. While writing this article, I asked Google to show me the nearest Best Buy. The result was so accurate (including a pin on a map for my location) that I don\"t want to show the screen shot here! It gave me a map, phone numbers, and hours \"?all on my mobile screen. It was as if I\\'d asked the person next to me \"?only better, with visuals and tappable phone numbers. In fact, personal digital assistants like OK Google, Cortana, and Siri are almost better than having your own human executive assistant. A digital assistant can schedule an appointment in seconds, placing it on your calendar instantly. You can send a text entirely with voice commands, without ever typing a single letter on a keyboard. You can turn a search question into a task, complete with a calendar reminder and a map with directions. Even complex tasks like planning a trip have become easier: with a few voice commands, you can find and book a flight and hotel, put the trip on your calendar, and get a weather report for your destination. Everything but packing your suitcase can be done via voice. This holiday season, the Amazon Echo was a popular gift \"?so much so that it sold out just before Christmas Day. The Echo, along with devices like Google Home, are taking search to the next level. Search has now become ubiquitous. It\\'s on our phones, and in our home devices. Not only can the Echo play music and turn lights on and off, it can order household items that you\\'re run out of. And with 2-hour delivery from Amazon Prime, you needn\"t leave your house. It\\'s easier than a trip to the grocery store. Search is a major component of home assistants like the Echo. But the Echo orders everything from Amazon. Google Home, on the other hand, serves up results from Google\\'s search engine. Marketers need to be ready for an influx of voice searches for their products and services from Google Home. Google is changing the search game for businesses within the Google search results, too. Starting next month, Google is going to automatically include phone numbers in search ads on mobile devices for advertisers who have a prominent phone number on their landing page. Previously, advertisers could add call extensions to their ads, which would incorporate a tappable phone number in their mobile ads.  With the latest change, call extensions aren\"t necessary \"?Google will automatically include a phone number in your ad if you feature one prominently on your landing page, as many businesses do. Automatically including phone numbers in ads does two things: it acknowledges that mobile advertising is here to stay, and it makes ads more humanly relevant by encouraging phone calls from those with a phone in their hand. We live in interesting times. As consumers, we have an ever-increasing number of options when it comes to searching for and purchasing goods and services. As advertisers, businesses have more ways than ever before to connect with their audience \"?but it\\'s become more complicated. Businesses must think beyond keywords and landing pages, and focus on how their customers and prospects interact with them. Understanding the mindset of the customer is more important than ever. Organizations that can make their experience more humanly relevant will be successful in this new era.'],\n",
       " ['The Mass Grave We Call Collateral Damage nan \"Lot of killers. We\\'ve got a lot of killers. Boy, you think our country\\'s so innocent? You think our country\\'s so innocent?\" We have carnage and we have irony. The speaker is the president, of course. It\\'s Super Bowl Sunday and here he is, generating another eyeball-popping headline as he dares to compare American collateral damage over the years with (as a chorus of shocked critics exclaimed) Vladimir Putin\\'s remorseless homicides. This happened during a pre-Super Bowl interview with Bill O\\'Reilly last Sunday, after O\\'Reilly had challenged Trump\\'s coziness with Russia and called Putin a killer. Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska summed up the outrage thus: \"There is no moral equivalency between the United States of America, the greatest freedom-loving nation in the history of the world, and the murderous thugs that are in Putin\\'s defense of his cronyism.\" Too bad we can\\'t ask 8-year-old Nawar al-Awlaki for her opinion on whose killings are worse, America\\'s or Russia\\'s. She apparently bled to death from a neck wound a week before the Trump interview, during the disastrous U.S. raid on Yemen that left a Navy SEAL -- and maybe 23 civilians -- dead. This was a Trump authorized raid, the first of his presidency, but had been planned many months earlier. A newborn baby was also killed in the raid, according to the British humanitarian organization Reprieve, along with other women and children. How many children have been buried thus far in the mass grave we call collateral damage? Nawar was the sister of Abdulrahman Awlaki, a 16-year-old boy killed in a 2011 drone strike, two weeks after the children\\'s father, an alleged al Qaeda leader (and U.S. citizen), was killed, also in a drone strike. \"Why kill children?\" Nawar\\'s grandfather asked after the girl\\'s death. But the politics of our drone assassinations and our air strikes and our wars justify and soften the murders we commit. Even now, as consensus consigns the Iraq war to the status of \"mistake,\" we still refuse to take official responsibility for its consequences. The shattered country, the dead, the dislocated, the rise of terrorism -- come on, cut us a little slack, OK? We were bringing democracy to Iraq. The unpredictable Trump spews out a fragment of spur-of-the-moment truth in a Fox News interview -- \"you think our country\\'s so innocent?\" -- and the consensus critics can only writhe in outrage. \"One can argue that\\'s the most anti-American statement ever made by the president of the United States,\" retired Gen. Barry McCaffrey exclaimed on MSNBC, defending American exceptionalism as though it were God. What a strange game this president is playing. Fervid belief in this exceptionalism is the foundation of Trump\\'s support. The raw meat he throws to his supporters is fear and hatred and clearly defined enemies: Muslims, Mexicans, refugees and immigrants from everywhere (except Europe). His allegiance to white nationalism and corporatocracy and war, the unacknowledged beneficiaries of this exceptionalism, is serious, and reflected in his cabinet choices. \"Everyone on Trump\\'s national insecurity team seems to agree on one thing: the United States is in a global war to the death,\" Ira Chernus writes at TomDispatch, for instance, quoting the crusading militarism of a number of his advisors and appointees, such as Deputy National Security Advisor K.T. McFarland. \"If we do not destroy the scourge of radical Islam, it will ultimately destroy Western civilization . . . and the values we hold dear,\" she has said. \"For her,\" Chernus noted, \"it\\'s an old story: civilization against the savages.\" And, indeed, Trump\\'s ascension to the presidency was cited by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists as the reason they set the Doomsday Clock -- Planet Earth\\'s largest, most ominous metaphor -- ahead by thirty seconds in January, to two and a half minutes to midnight. The Bulletin\\'s Science and Security Board explained: \"This already-threatening world situation was the backdrop for a rise in strident nationalism worldwide in 2016, including in a U.S. presidential campaign during which the eventual victor, Donald Trump, made disturbing comments about the use and proliferation of nuclear weapons and expressed disbelief in the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change.\" I note all this in the context of Trump\\'s Fox News tease -- that the United States is no more innocent in its wars and murders than Russia is -- and his perplexing, perhaps business-related friendliness with Putin, which seems to address one of the major concerns of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. The Board, in its Doomsday Clock statement, noted with alarm: \"The United States and Russia--which together possess more than 90 percent of the world\\'s nuclear weapons--remained at odds in a variety of theaters, from Syria to Ukraine to the borders of NATO.\" Trump is a walking maelstrom of racism, arrogance, greed, incompetence and political incorrectness. He approved the Navy SEAL raid in Yemen with a shrug, as he ate dinner. Children died. The smiling face of Nawar al-Awlaki now haunts the mission. As Bonnie Kristian wrote recently at Business Insider: \"President Trump promised real change in U.S. foreign policy, and in at least one clear regard he has already delivered: Where President Obama spent six years waging covert drone warfare in Yemen and nearly two years quietly supporting brutal Saudi intervention in the Gulf state\\'s civil war, Trump drew national outrage to this heretofore ignored conflict in nine days flat.\" In his own racism and hypocrisy, is Trump exposing the hypocrisy of the media and the military-industrial complex?

       " ['The GOP\\'s Biggest Integrity Test nan Anyone who still cares about open government, compliance with the nation\\'s laws, ethical behavior and good governance should watch Congress closely in the weeks and months ahead. We will soon learn whether the Republicans who control the Legislative Branch are willing to fulfill their constitutional obligation to ensure that a president - even a president from their own party - does not abuse his office. The same obligation applies to the Judicial Branch, but for the last eight years it has been Republican leaders in Congress who seem to have forgotten why they were there. From the time in 2010 that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the top priority for Republicans was to deny Barack Obama a second term, they acted as if they were elected solely to win more elections rather than to solve the nation\\'s problems. With few exceptions, virtually everything Obama tried to do during his eight years in office was dead on arrival on Capitol Hill. By October 2011, Obama announced, \"\"We can\\'t wait for Congress to do its job, so where they won\\'t act, I will.\" The result, loudly protested by Republican leaders, was Obama\\'s governance by executive order. If you talk to the aging congressmen who served around 40 years ago, most will remember wistfully when the top priority of the two political parties was to govern well, often by working together. Today, the political warfare typical of election years does not stop during the off-years. It has become a 24/7/365 contest for political dominance rather than an honest clash of ideas. What many of us remember most about the last two sessions of Congress is the shutdown of the government, the 500 filibusters in the Senate, and the endless show-votes in both chambers merely to position members for reelection. With Republicans soon to be in control of all three branches of government, the question is whether they now will govern responsibly and with integrity. The early signs are not promising. One of the new Congress\\'s first acts was an effort by House Republicans to weaken the office that investigates allegations of congressional misconduct. That calls into question how Congress would deal with misconduct by President Trump and his team. When it comes to betrayals of the public\\'s trust, Congress\\'s biggest test will be to make sure there are none by the President. Whether it\\'s because he is new to government and unfamiliar with its standards, or because he is so used to autocratic rule in his business empire, or because he thinks his supporters don\\'t care whether he behaves ethically and lawfully, Trump already has entangled himself in questionable behaviors. I don\\'t need to be more specific; Trump\\'s behavior dominates every news cycle. It\\'s enough to note as Politico has that \"leaders with divided interests cannot faithfully serve those who elected them.\" Although we already see that the courts will be used to challenge the Administration (see chart), Trump is likely to wear lawsuits like battle ribbons. Besides, lawsuits do not release Congress from its constitutional duty to check abuses of presidential power. The next congressional elections are less than two years away. Republicans have that amount of time to prove they are willing and able to keep the President from behaving unethically or illegally, up to and including \"high crimes and misdemeanors\". If members of Congress cannot do that job -- if they cannot begin putting good governance above bad politics - they should not be there. It\\'s just that simple. *** Less than two weeks after Trump moved into the White House, a survey by Public Opinion Research found that 40% of U.S. voters want him removed from office. Talk of impeachment is very premature. Before Republican leaders are likely consider impeachment proceedings, they would have to decide that Trump\\'s behaviors will not change and will do serious damage to the nation, the presidency and the Party\\'s prospects. In the meantime, we already hear discussions about exactly what the Constitution means by \"high crimes and misdemeanors\". Jon Roland of the Constitution Society is one of many scholars who have studied that question. We might think that \"high crimes\" refers to the felonies and misdemeanors that apply to all of us, but Roland says the phrase refers instead to punishable offenses that only apply to high-level public officials who because of their status \"are under special obligations that ordinary persons are not under\". Other scholars interpret the phrase to mean a president\\'s abuse of his or her office and betrayal of the public trust. Federal standards on ethics, conflicts of interest and nepotism would seem to be among those \"special obligations\". Stewardship of the reputation and integrity of the presidency might qualify, too. What seems certain is this: Unless there are radical changes in the behavior of this president and his people, we will see intensifying discussions about where Congress and the American people must draw the line. Graphic: The above chart from Statista shows the number of lawsuits already filed against President Trump\\'s administration compared to previous recent presidents.

President Vladimir Putin has sent condolences after a Russian air strike accidentally killed three Turkish soldiers in northern Syria. The strike hit a building near the town of al-Bab, believing it to contain Islamic State (IS) fighters rather than Turkish troops, Turkey\\'s military said. Eleven others were wounded in the so-called friendly fire incident. They were supporting Syrian rebels who are locked in a fierce battle to try to capture al-Bab from IS fighters. Russia and Turkey, who back opposing sides in the Syrian war, have been jointly conducting air strikes on IS in the town in recent weeks. The Russian aircraft had been planning to hit IS targets but \"by accident three of our soldiers were martyred when a building was bombed where our units were,\" Turkey\\'s military said. The Kremlin has issued a statement (in Russian) saying President Putin had, in a telephone call with his Turkish counterpart, \"expressed condolences over a tragic incident which resulted in the deaths of several Turkish troops in the al-Bab area\". Turkey and Russia: Uneasy allies Turkey\\'s downing of Russian warplane in 2015 Why is there a war in Syria? President Putin told Recep Tayyip Erdogan that poor co-ordination between Moscow and Ankara was to blame for the accident, RIA news agency reports. The two leaders agreed to \"increase military co-operation during operations in Syria against IS militants and other extremist organisations\". Both countries are conducting a joint investigation, Turkey\\'s military said. The incident comes after a warming of relations between the two countries, which had previously been strained after Turkey downed a Russian jet near the Syrian border two years ago. Earlier on Thursday, Turkish-backed rebel fighters managed to capture the western outskirts of al-Bab, which lies about 30km (20 miles) south of Turkey. Turkish media say 10 Turkish soldiers have been killed in the fighting in recent days. The Dogan news agency says 66 Turkish troops have been killed in Syria since Turkey began its operations there last August to drive out IS, as well as stop the advance of the Kurdish YPG militia - which Turkey considers a terror organisation. At the end of 2015, Russia and Turkey risked military confrontation as the Turkish military shot down a Russian jet which it said had violated its airspace. By the end of 2016, the two, who back opposite sides in the Syrian war, were co-operating to reach a ceasefire in Aleppo. The murder of the Russian ambassador in Ankara didn\\'t derail ties - and nor will today\\'s military accident. Why? Because the two countries need each other. Partly in their general bilateral relations, with Turkey importing most of its energy from Russia and relying on Russian tourists. But partly too in order to achieve their respective aims in Syria. Turkey wants a buffer zone in northern Syria free of IS and the Kurdish militia that it sees as terrorists - and has needed Russian consent for its troops to launch a ground offensive in northern Syria over the past few months. And Russia has managed to prop up the Assad regime and needed Turkey - one of Assad\\'s fiercest opponents - to turn a blind eye to the recapture of Aleppo. Realpolitik has taken the place of steadfast ethics - as it so often does. The Turkish-backed Syrian rebels have been battling IS for al-Bab since late 2016. Syrian government forces, meanwhile, are also closing in on IS from the south, where fierce fighting is reported. Reports suggest the rebels and government forces have reached an accommodation over al-Bab, orchestrated by Syria\\'s key alley, Russia. The two sides are now within 3km of each other on opposite sides of the city. Despite supporting opposing sides, Russia and Turkey have joined forces in recent months to try to end the Syria conflict. They carried out their first joint air strikes on IS targets in the al-Bab area in January, just weeks after securing a ceasefire deal between rebels and government forces that has held in many parts of Syria since the end of last year.'],\n",
       " ['Dubs amendment: End of child migrant scheme \\'shameful\\' Church leaders, MPs and peers have condemned the decision to end the \"Dubs amendment\" scheme to let unaccompanied migrant children in to the UK. Church leaders, MPs and peers have condemned the decision to end the \"Dubs amendment\" scheme to let unaccompanied migrant children in to the UK. The Archbishop of Canterbury said he was \"shocked\", while Labour\\'s Yvette Cooper described it as \"shameful\". Ministers said 350 children would have arrived under the scheme by the time it ended in March but that there were fears it encouraged people traffickers. Theresa May says what the UK is doing to help refugees is \"absolutely right\". The Dubs amendment, designed by the Labour peer and former child refugee Lord Dubs, aimed to help some of the estimated 90,000 unaccompanied migrant children across Europe. It was accepted by then Prime Minister David Cameron last year after he was faced with a rebellion in the House of Lords. While there was no target number specified in law, Lord Dubs and his supporters had suggested the UK could help 3,000 of the most vulnerable. On Wednesday, ministers announced that 200 children had been brought in under the scheme and that it would close after another 150 were settled in the UK. Home Secretary Amber Rudd defended the decision, which she said had been made after France raised concerns it could be encouraging more children to make the perilous journey to Europe. Speaking in the Commons, she said: \"I am clear that when working with my French counterparts they do not want us to indefinitely continue to accept children under the Dubs amendment because they specify, and I agree with them, that it acts as a draw. \"It acts as a pull. It encourages the people traffickers.\" She said the government remained committed to accepting 3,000 child refugees from crisis-hit regions such as Syria. The move has prompted fierce criticism from MPs, including those from the Tory party, as well as the Archbishop of Canterbury. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott attacked Ms Rudd, asking: \"How does she live with herself?\" Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron attacked the government for a \"betrayal of these vulnerable children and a betrayal of British values\", while Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley said the decision was \"an absolute disgrace\". Tory MP David Burrowes said it looks like the government has \"cut and run from child refugees\" while Conservative MP Heidi Allen MP said she would support a judicial review on the decision. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said the UK had a \"great history of welcoming those in need\" and hoped the government would reconsider its decision. The Bishop of Croydon, the Rt Revd Jonathan Clark, who has been involved with efforts to welcome child migrants, said the government was \"in effect helping the trafficking industry\". While Lord Dubs said: \"I believe in arbitrarily closing down the scheme, without any good reason for doing so, the government is in breach of its own commitments.\" However, the prime minister has defended the government\\'s approach to refugees by pointing to various other schemes adopted to bring them into the UK. She said: \"We have been seeing quite a number of children and families being resettled here in the United Kingdom and I think what we are doing in terms of refugees is absolutely right.\" The total number of children to accept under the Dubs amendment was reached after consultation with local authorities - with councils indicating they could provide care to no more than 350 unaccompanied child migrants. David Simmonds, chairman of the Local Government Association\\'s asylum, refugee and migration task group, said councils had \"demonstrated tremendous leadership at a local, regional and national level in resettling the children from the Calais camp.\" A legal challenge on how the government has handled the legal commitment will go ahead on Friday.'],\n",

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has appointed Rebecca Long-Bailey as shadow business secretary, as he reshuffled the shadow cabinet. Sue Hayman takes the environment, food and rural affairs brief, while Christina Rees becomes shadow Welsh secretary. The new shadow chief secretary to the Treasury is Peter Dowd. The business brief became vacant when Clive Lewis resigned on Wednesday to oppose his party in the Brexit vote. Other shadow cabinet members remain in place. What is striking about this announcement is not who has been appointed, and to which job - it is the leadership\\'s approach to the frontbenchers among the 52 Labour rebels who defied Jeremy Corbyn in last night\\'s vote on Brexit. Most of them tonight are still in a job, despite abandoning the collective responsibility of the party\\'s official position and ignoring their leader. I understand it\\'s unlikely there will be any sackings. This in itself is extraordinary, not least because among the rebels were three whips, the very people responsible for party discipline. It illustrates what you might call Jeremy Corbyn\\'s human resources challenge. When you discount those who won\\'t serve under him, and those who have but no longer do, his options are limited. Ms Long-Bailey, MP for Salford and Eccles, was previously shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. Ms Hayman, MP for Workington in West Cumbria, was a shadow environment before her promotion, while Ms Rees, MP for Neath, was a shadow justice minister. Mr Dowd is MP for Bootle. All four entered Parliament at the 2015 general election. There are now 14 women in Mr Corbyn\\'s 29-member shadow cabinet. Mr Lewis announced his resignation from the party\\'s front bench as MPs began voting for the final time on the Brexit bill on Wednesday. In a letter to Mr Corbyn, he wrote that he was leaving the shadow cabinet \"with a very heavy heart\", but Labour had not won \"the protections the people of this country need\" during the Commons debates on Brexit. Asked on the BBC about Mr Lewis\\'s departure, Mr Corbyn said: \"It\\'s not a disaster. The majority of Labour MPs voted to trigger Article 50. Fifty-odd voted against it, mainly on the basis of their strong message from their own constituents.\"'],\n",

The Eiffel Tower in Paris is to have a 2.5m-high (8ft) wall of reinforced glass built around it as protection against terror attacks, officials say. The Paris mayor\\'s office says the wall will replace metal fences put up for the Euro 2016 football tournament. The project, if approved, is expected to cost about \\x8010m (?17m; $21m) and work should start later this year. The French capital has been on high alert since attacks by jihadists in November 2015 left 130 people dead. Last July, 86 people were killed when a lorry ploughed through a crowd celebrating Bastille Day in the southern city of Nice. The Eiffel Tower, one of France\\'s most famous landmarks, attracts more than six million visitors each year and the wall is designed to stop individuals or vehicles storming the site, said the assistant mayor for tourism, Jean-Francois Martins. \"The terror threat remains high in Paris and the most vulnerable sites, led by the Eiffel Tower, must be the object of special security measures,\" he said. \"We will replace the metal grids to the north and south with glass panels which will allow Parisians and visitors a very pleasant view of the monument.\" Mr Martins added: \"We have three aims - to improve the look, make access easier and strengthen the protection of visitors and staff.\" The project will also involve reorganising pathways around the tower.

While the motion is largely symbolic, MPs have warned legislation will be brought in if changes are not made. Sports Minister Tracey Crouch has said the FA could lose ?30m-?40m of public funding if it does not modernise. Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) Select Committee chairman Damian Collins said: \"No change is no option.\" He added: \"The FA, to use a football analogy, are not only in extra time, they are at the end of extra time, in \\'Fergie Time\\'. They are 1-0 down and if they don\\'t pick up fairly quickly, reform will be delivered to them.\" I would have thought with the state of the NHS, the lack of building, not enough cash for defence, that [MPs] would put energy into that not the organisation of football FA chairman Greg Clarke has said he will quit if the organisation cannot win government support for its reform plans. \"I watched the debate and respect the opinions of the MPs,\" he said. \"As previously stated, we remain committed to reforming governance at the FA to the agreed timescale of the minister.\" Collins suggested ministers should intervene to overhaul English football\\'s governing body because \"turkeys won\\'t vote for Christmas\" and it will not reform itself. Crouch warned the FA that if it played \"Russian roulette\" with public money it will lose. The minister also said the government would be prepared to consider legislation if the FA fails to present plans for required reforms before April. However she felt the debate - which was sparsely attended by MPs - was premature given her desire to see the FA\\'s proposals. Media playback is not supported on this device The committee has published two reports since 2010 recommending greater representation at the FA for fans and the grassroots game, as well as more diversity in positions of authority. It also wants to dilute the perceived dominance of the Premier League. Collins has said the FA was given six months to meet the government guidance on best practice for sports governance but had failed to do so. That guidance called for things such as a move towards gender equality on boards, more independent oversight, more accountability and term limits for office bearers. He was joined by fellow Tories and Labour MPs - keen to ensure the \"national game\" is run correctly - in bemoaning the current state of the FA. The cross-party motion stated that MPs have no confidence in the FA\\'s ability to comply fully with its duties as its existing governance structures make it \"impossible for the organisation to reform itself\". It was approved unopposed at the end of a backbench business debate, which was attended by fewer than 30 MPs. The FA is effectively run by its own parliament, the FA Council, which has 122 members - just eight are women and only four from ethnic minorities. More than 90 of the 122 members are aged over 60. Shadow sports minister Rosena Allin-Khan said: \"Not only is diversity not in the heart of the FA ,it isn\\'t in its body, or even its soul.\" Labour MP Keith Vaz, whose constituency of Leicester East is home to the Premier League champions Leicester City, added: \"A quarter of all professional footballers are black, however only 17 of the 92 top clubs have an ethnic minority person in a senior coaching role.\" However, Keith Compton - one of 25 FA life vice-presidents and a director of Derbyshire FA - questioned why the FA was being discussed in Parliament. \"It is pity that the MPs have got nothing better to do,\" he told BBC Radio 5 live. \"I would have thought with the state of the NHS, the lack of building, too many people living in boxes, not enough cash for defence, that some people would put energy into that not the organisation of football. \"Football is reforming all of the time.\" Asked whether there should be more female and ethnic minority involvement in FA decisions, he said: \"That\\'s not really the responsibility of the council. If those people were interested enough, and we had enough people, we would have enough women and other people on the FA. \"I have heard people say supporters aren\\'t represented but that is not true. They have one representative. People want the council to be reduced and now I am hearing it should be increased.\" Responding to the interview, former FA chairman David Bernstein said: \"I think if you want an argument for change, you\\'ve just heard it.\" And Yunus Lunat, the first Muslim to get a seat on the FA Council before leaving three years ago, said new recruits were needed. \"No-one is disputing the contribution the previous generation has made but there comes a time when you have got to recognise that you are not the most suitable people for the role,\" he said. Media playback is not supported on this device Football Supporters\\' Federation chairman Malcolm Clarke: \"We\\'re very pleased to see so many MPs back our proposals for a minimum of five fan representatives on the FA Council, representation on the FA board, and increased diversity. \"Supporters are integral to the health of our national sport yet are still shockingly under-represented in the FA hierarchy - the FA Council has only one supporter representative, yet the Armed Forces and Oxbridge have five. \"It is also important to acknowledge that the FA Council has stood up to rampant commercialism within the game and protected fans\\' interests - such as when the FA Council stopped the \"Hull Tigers\" name change.\" Sports minister Tracey Crouch: \"The FA\\'s current model does not, in my opinion, and clearly that of other colleagues, stand up to scrutiny. Reform is therefore required.\" Judith Cummins (Labour, Bradford South): \"At best they\\'re dragging their feet, at worst they\\'re wilfully failing to act.\" Andrew Bingham, CMS Committee member: \"The issues of Sam Allardyce, who manages the (England) team for 67 days, one game, walks away with allegedly around ?1m, it is destroying people\\'s faith in football.\" Nigel Huddleston (Conservative, Mid Worcestershire): \"I have a great deal of respect for Greg Clarke but I sense his hands are tied and a sense of institutional inertia pervades the governance of football in this country.\" Share this with Guess who these angry lyrics were aimed at Get latest scores and headlines sent straight to your phone, sign-up to our newsletter and learn where to find us on online.

It was not possible to establish whether his epilepsy - the result of a riding accident in 1996 - contributed to the fall, Westminster Coroner's Court was told. Coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe ruled his death on 12 December was an accident. The court heard he suffered a fatal head injury after falling 12 feet (3.5m) from the window at his home in Belgravia. Mr Swinburn was nicknamed the 'Choirboy' and picked up numerous successes around the world before his retirement in 2000.

Academics have revealed what they claim is the first \"historically accurate\" portrait of Jane Austen\\'s Mr Darcy - and he\\'s a world away from the romantic hero of films and TV. Instead of the broad shoulders and square jaw of Colin Firth there is a modestly-sized chest and pointy chin. There is little description of him in Pride and Prejudice, so the academics used historical fashions from the 1790s, when it was written. This version also wears a powdered wig. \"Our Mr Darcy portrayal reflects the male physique and common features at the time,\" says Amanda Vickery, professor of early modern history at Queen Mary University of London. \"Men sported powdered hair, had narrow jaws and muscular, defined legs were considered very attractive,\" she says. Colin Firth got the nation\\'s collective hearts racing in 1995 with his depiction of the mysterious Mr Darcy in the BBC\\'s adaptation. Further adaptations since have followed in the style of Firth\\'s portrayal including Matthew Macfadyen in the 2005 film of Pride and Prejudice. But the academics say their muscular chests and broad shoulders would have been the sign of a labourer and not a gentleman at the time the book was written. The fans\\' favourite Mr Darcy moments - when Colin Firth walked out of a lake dripping wet and Matthew Macfadyen crossed a field in the mist, both showing off their chests - would not have looked the same with the historically accurate Mr Darcy and his sloping narrow shoulders. Some fans have not been impressed by the portrait. Professor John Sutherland, from University College London, who led the research says they only had \"scraps\" of physical description of the character Fitzwilliam Darcy. As well as looking at the fashions of the day they also looked at Austen\\'s relationships and the men who may have inspired her characters. \"He is our most mysterious and desirable leading man of all time, says Prof Sutherland. And he appears frequently in modern culture. Further depictions of Mr Darcy include Matthew Rhys who played the character in the TV adaptation of the Pride and Prejudice \"sequel\" Death Comes to Pemberley. He also inspired the character of Mark Darcy in Bridget Jones\\'s Diary by Helen Fielding, also portrayed by Colin Firth in the film versions.

       " ['NHS Health Check: How Germany\\'s healthcare system works The day after his hip replacement, Georg Thoma was cheerfully sitting up in bed. The day after his hip replacement, Georg Thoma was cheerfully sitting up in bed. Like most Germans, the businessman pays into compulsory health insurance. He contributes 7% of his salary before tax and his employers match that amount. In return, patients get access to care which is so rapid that national waiting data is not collected. \"The doctor said to me that I have to decide when I get the operation. Normally it takes three or four weeks.\" Georg travels for work to the UK and tells me he was astonished to hear that patients can sometimes wait months for a similar routine operation. Germany\\'s spending on health care is relatively high, just over 11% of its wealth, compared to 9.8% in the UK and it has more doctors and hospital beds per patient than the UK. Georg\\'s operation was carried out in an 80-bed hospital in one of the Black Forest towns in the south-west region Baden Wurttemberg. But even in Germany\\'s well-funded system, the financial viability of a hospital this small is not guaranteed. A group of doctors in this area is trying to manage costs in an experiment that has attracted interest from the UK. Martin Wetzel, a GP for 25 years, explains they have done a deal with big insurance funds to make prevention a priority. \"I have more time - and it needs more time to explain to patients what I\\'m doing and why. So my consultations changed from an eye wink to an average of 15 minutes,\" he says. During that time patients might be offered a range of interventions to improve their health provided locally, which frees up time for the GP. These include subsidised gym sessions, access to different sports and nutrition advice as well as screening programmes to reduce loneliness as well as increasing healthiness. It is being run by a company called Gesundes Kinzigtal in which the doctors are majority shareholders. Already a couple of years into their 10-year project, they say healthcare is costing 6% less than you would expect for the population. They are trying to improve data sharing and believe hospital treatment can be reduced further. Much of the vision comes from its chief executive Helmut Hildebrandt, a pharmacist and public health expert. He says the health insurance funds have tended to concentrate on short-term cost control measures, rather than improving the health of their patients. \"At the moment the economy in Germany runs so well they don\\'t have a problem. But in the long run every politician or administrator knows in the next 10 or 20 years the system will run into a crisis.\" He fears that could undermine the commitment to the health insurance covering most Germans, with a risk of richer people opting out of it. What Gesundes Kinzigtal is trying to do is similar to some integrated care projects in the NHS. There is more money in the German system, but arguably more waste too. The Caesarean rate is higher, so is the use of MRI for diagnosis and the length of hospital stay. And in many ways there has been little incentive for change in a system where doctors still have a high degree of influence and life expectancy in Germany is not higher than the UK. Bernadette Klapper heads the health section of the Robert Bosch Foundation, which funds social policy innovation. \"I think we should get more for the money we spend inside healthcare. While we see other countries spending less, but having the same results as us, there\\'s something wrong.\" Germany is ageing very rapidly, only just behind Japan in forecast for its population profile. But the health system is changing slowly and the Bosch foundation is trying to encourage more small health centres. Many doctors in Germany set up in practice on their own, as GPs or out-of-hospital specialists, but as cities are more popular that leaves rural areas with a shortage. Travel east to the wide open rolling countryside of Thuringia and you get a glimpse of the challenge. Five years ago they were 200 GPs short of what was needed in this region. It has taken grants, and offers of help with housing and arranging childcare, to reduce that to 60. Annette Rommel is head of the doctors\\' association in the village of Mechterstadt and says: \"A few years ago we arranged for specially-trained nurses to make home visits and for more teamwork with nurses and doctors together.\" It is similar to the way many community nurses work in the UK, but in Germany this is a recent development. Nurses have a much more restricted role. On a visit I saw a nurse and a carer, who is paid for out of the long-term care insurance that Germany introduced 20 years ago, check up on an elderly couple. It has reduced the amount families have to pay, although social care can still be a financial worry. There is enough money in the German system to make trying new approaches to healthcare a little easier. Most patients feel they can see a doctor easily, so for example the number of visits to the equivalent of A&E is very low compared to the UK. While out of hours care has been reorganised, GPs and other out of hospital doctors are often still involved in helping provide cover on a rotation. None of this removes the long-term worry about whether providing such rapid and easy access to care is affordable in the long term. A debate that German politicians are unlikely to begin publicly in this election year or any time soon. Germany UK The lessons for the UK are that money on its own is not the only solution, although it does ease pressure in the system considerably. Finding better co-ordinated ways of looking after patients, often elderly, with the highest health needs is a priority. And in Germany, despite the long-term care insurance, families still have to contribute a significant amount to looking after older people. However, there is a mechanism for sustainable funding for social care that is very different from the significant reductions in care budgets seen in the UK.

       " ['The health service taking a holistic approach to patients \"My colleagues think I\\'m mad,\" says Dr Andrew Weatherburn. \"My colleagues think I\\'m mad,\" says Dr Andrew Weatherburn. As a consultant in geriatric medicine, he is an unlikely addition to the Moor Park Health and Leisure Centre, where schoolchildren queue for swimming lessons and people grab coffees between Zumba lessons. \"Moving out of the hospital and into the community is the best thing I\\'ve done as a consultant.\" Dr Weatherburn works on the Fylde Coast, an NHS Vanguard area. The local health service here is pioneering a new model of working, which could become a blueprint for the rest of the NHS. Blackpool and Fylde suffer from many of the problems that plague the NHS nationally. With constantly increasing demand and a shortfall in supply, the local services have been under considerable strain for years. Add to that a higher than average elderly population, which is set to double by 2030, and the local health service begins to look unsustainable. \"It\\'s about 3% of our population that use about 50% of the resources,\" says Dr Tony Naughton, the head of the clinical commissioning group in Fylde. As a part-time GP, he understands the need for an accurate diagnosis so their first innovation was to use patient data to work out who was actually using the services. They were predominantly elderly and tended to suffer from more than one long-term condition. Rather than waiting for these patients to arrive at A&E, the Fylde Coast district set up the Extensive Care system, targeting resources on actively trying to keep them healthier. Rather than providing temporary fixes every time a patient is in hospital, this model takes a more holistic approach. \"These patients were going off to see a kidney specialist and then a diabetic specialist and then a heart specialist. They had a career in attending hospital, whereas this service wraps all of those outpatients appointments together and looks at each person as an individual, rather than as a heart or as a kidney.\" Dr Naughton explains that to make this more joined up system work, it was taken out of the rigid departmental structure of the hospital and placed firmly in the community. Dr Weatherburn, at his clinic in the leisure centre, believes the benefits are obvious. \"I definitely know my patients much better now.\" While in hospital, he would have had about 10 minutes to assess a patient\\'s most urgent needs. Now every patient who is referred to them receives a thorough two-hour assessment with a group of medics, who then hold a meeting to come up with a co-ordinated treatment plan for each one. This system uses welfare workers as well as medics to manage each patients needs. \"Somebody may come in with a chest infection, but that maybe because they\\'re not eating properly or they have a damp house. Now, I can\\'t write a prescription for a dry house, but I can put them in touch with someone who can help with their housing problem,\" explains Dr Naughton. The welfare workers spend more time with the patients, helping them with broader social issues and finding ways of managing their illnesses at home. Their job is really to empower patients to take control of their own health. Dr Weatherburn says it is working. \"It\\'s often the little things that made the big difference. It\\'s not the big medical interventions and fancy tests, it\\'s helping with loneliness, and helping the carers and families as well.\" This may sound expensive, but the scheme should pay for itself. The new welfare workers are not medically trained so employment costs are lower, but their intervention can solve underlying problems which keep people coming back to A&E. The results are certainly impressive. After a year-and-a-half of trialling the scheme, the Fylde Coast has already seen 13% fewer attendances at A&E, and 23-24% fewer outpatient attendances. When Lily Greenwood\\'s husband, Peter, left hospital after suffering from a stroke, they were referred to the Extensive Care service. \"The doctor sent us here. We didn\\'t want to come, but it\\'s been the best thing ever.\" Although Lily wasn\\'t the patient, the team\\'s approach of looking at every aspect of the patient\\'s well-being, meant that attention turned to 80-year-old Lily too, as Peter\\'s sole carer. The team helped her to take control. \"It took its toll on me at the beginning, but now, I just feel that with coming here, we can cope with it.\" The team filled in all the forms that Lily had been baffled by, they helped her to apply for the extra benefits she was entitled to and, most importantly, they helped her to manage her husband\\'s condition. They even introduced her to local support groups for carers so that she no longer feels alone or overwhelmed. \"The nurses to me are friends. They have time for you. We\\'re a lot happier now. I feel I can cope with Peter now.\" A week of coverage by BBC News examining the state of the NHS across the UK as it comes under intense pressure during its busiest time of the year. Given their success in reducing pressure on A&E departments, Blackpool and Fylde applied a similarly local, holistic model of care to a broader section of the population. Every neighbourhood received its own dedicated team of therapists, nurses and welfare workers who could treat patients at home in order to reduce the pressures on GP surgeries. \"It\\'s a cultural change. We don\\'t just do the therapy and rush to the next appointment, we think about a patient\\'s overall well-being.\" Lucy Leonard is part of a neighbourhood team in Blackpool. Having been an occupational therapist for 17 years, she knows the NHS is notoriously resistant to change. Yet, she insists, this system is being embraced by patients and practitioners alike. \"Sometimes people can feel a bit frightened and threatened by change, especially when they worry about their professional identity and being asked to do new roles, but really, it\\'s just about putting the patient at the heart of what we do.\" This system has been a success on the Fylde Coast, and the principles could be replicated across the country. By investing in a more holistic approach, not only has the pressure on hospitals and GP surgeries been eased but, vitally, people are healthier and better able to manage their health too.'],\n",

BBC News\\'s Mark Simpson, who reported on the case, looks back at the deception. Shannon Matthews\\'s disappearance in a 2008 hoax-kidnapping is being recounted in a BBC drama. BBC News\\'s Mark Simpson, who reported on the case, looks back at the deception. Karen Matthews made a fool out of me. I looked into her sunken eyes, saw that she was petrified and gave her the benefit of the doubt. Maybe my judgement was coloured by the fact that she chose to give me her first interview. Maybe it was clouded by seeing inside her small semi-detached house, and the grim conditions in which she and her seven children were living. Maybe I was so cold at the time, my brain froze. Karen\\'s daughter Shannon, nine, disappeared on the coldest night of the year in February 2008. Police divers who searched a lake near her home in Dewsbury Moor in West Yorkshire had to break through ice to get into the water. The air temperature had dipped to -4C. The night Karen agreed to talk to me, I was shaking with cold after spending hour after hour talking live on the BBC News Channel (or BBC News 24 as it was then). Karen spotted me out of her front window and came out to talk. She was shaking too, but out of fear. She was scared - scared of being found out. She gave me no eye contact. She looked down the barrel of the BBC camera and said; \"Shannon if you\\'re out there, please come home. We love you to bits, we miss you so much. Please, I\\'m begging you baby, come home.\" When the police saw her interview on the BBC Ten O\\'Clock News, they were annoyed. They had advised her not to talk to the media. They were as surprised as me that she agreed to give me an interview. So was this erratic behaviour the first sign that all was not what it seemed? In hindsight, it may seem so, but at the time, it seemed simply a desperate act by a desperate mother. Fresh in my mind were the Soham murders of schoolgirls Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells. When children disappeared for more than 48 hours, the outcome was usually not good. That is why there was such a huge community effort to try to find Shannon. People realised that time was short. Yes, I did wonder if Karen Matthews was telling the truth. Everyone did. However, I believed her. And I was not alone. As well as searching hedges and parkland, the police drew up a map showing where convicted paedophiles lived in the Dewsbury area. They checked, and double-checked. There was no sign of Shannon. As days turned to weeks, the more convinced detectives became that Shannon would not be coming home. However, Karen\\'s friends and neighbours never gave up, and neither did the police. About 10% of the force\\'s officers were put on the case and more than ?3m was spent in what was one of the largest search operations since the hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper. Shannon was eventually found, 24 days after she disappeared. A BBC colleague got a tip-off and phoned me. I was shopping in Ikea in Leeds at the time, and nearly dropped my phone on a multi-coloured Swedish rug when I heard the news. As I drove down the A6110 to Dewsbury, I wondered if Karen would give me an interview again. We could do it in the same spot where we had first spoken. The only difference would be that this time she would be with Shannon beside her. The tears would turn to cheers. For once, it would be a story with a happy ending. What a fool I was. It later emerged that Shannon had been kept drugged and hidden in the base of a divan bed by the very people appealing for her safe return. That September Karen, and Michael Donovan, the uncle of Karen\\'s partner, went on trial for kidnap, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice. They were jailed for eight years after the court heard about their plot to hide the child and claim a ?50,000 reward that subsequently had been offered by the Sun.'],\n",

Speaking on the BBC\\'s Victoria Derbyshire programme, Labour peer Lord Dubs spoke of his disappointment that the government had \"gone back on their word\" on how many unaccompanied asylum-seeking children would be brought to the UK from Europe. The claim: The government had committed to taking 3,000 unaccompanied refugee children from Europe, but it will now close the programme after taking in just 350. Reality Check verdict: The government previously referred to a goal to bring 3,000 unaccompanied children to the UK but eventually passed an amendment that did not commit to a specific figure. Immigration Minister Robert Goodwill says the 350 figure meets the \"intention and spirit\" of the Dubs Amendment, but Lord Dubs disagrees. Speaking on the BBC\\'s Victoria Derbyshire programme, Labour peer Lord Dubs spoke of his disappointment that the government had \"gone back on their word\" on how many unaccompanied asylum-seeking children would be brought to the UK from Europe. The 3,000 figure was originally put forward in a campaign run by charity Save the Children. And in January 2016, the then Immigration Minister, James Brokenshire, said the government would commit to resettling increasing numbers of refugees, most of whom would be children, mentioning the 3,000 figure as a goal but without giving any figure as a commitment. Then, in March 2016, Lord Dubs, who came to the UK himself as a child refugee fleeing the Nazis, tabled an amendment to the Immigration Bill, which would require the UK to take in 3,000 children who had been separated from their families. This had strong support from all opposition parties and a number of Conservative MPs. And it passed in the House of Lords by a significant margin at the end of March. But when it went to the Commons in April, the Conservative government\\'s position was to vote against the amendment, and it was rejected by a narrow margin. It then went back to the House of Lords, where Lord Dubs reworded the amendment to read that the UK should take a \"specified number\" of unaccompanied children from Europe and that this number would be agreed later in discussion with local authorities. This again passed in the Lords with a significant majority. It then went back to the Commons and was expected to go to a vote on 9 May. But, on 4 May, ahead of the vote, Mr Cameron accepted the revised version of the amendment. Nearly a year later, on Wednesday, 8 February 2017, Immigration Minister Robert Goodwill announced that the government would transfer 350 unaccompanied children - about a 10th of the original figure - from refugee camps in Europe, which, he said, would meet the \"intention and spirit\" of Lord Dubs\\'s amendment. Mr Goodwill said this would include about 200 children already brought to the UK under the terms of Lord Dubs\\'s amendment and another 150 still to come. He said that more than 900 children had been brought here from Calais in total in 2016. The 700 brought to the UK but not under the terms of Lord Dubs\\'s amendment were brought here under a different regulation, which allows unaccompanied minors to come to the UK if they already have immediate family here.'],\n",

When infidelity website Ashley Madison was the victim of a hacking attack in 2015, the affected 36 million global users were suddenly very worried indeed. The business, a dating site for married people who wish to cheat on their spouse, had the data of its customers stolen and released on to the internet. All their names, passwords, phone numbers and addresses. While it was a very bleak time for Ashley Madison\\'s users, the company itself faced a major crisis, and it was found to be lacking. As customer numbers and revenues plummeted, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) - the US agency tasked with protecting consumers - ruled that the business had not done enough to protect people\\'s information, both before and after the attack. The FTC fined Ashley Madison $1.6m (?1.3m), and said that the financial penalty was only that low because it didn\\'t think that the business could afford to pay any more, such was the impact of the hack on its earnings. Where Ashley Madison failed was its insufficient crisis management - it hadn\\'t prepared enough for something bad happening, and how it would react. While the company tells the BBC it has subsequently overhauled all its systems, how should all firms best plan for and then respond to a crisis, be it a cyber-attack, financial scandal or other serious issue? With the UK government confirming last year that two-thirds of large British companies had experienced a cyber-attack in the previous 12 months alone, businesses who have an online presence anywhere in the world simply have to prepare for how they would react to a hack that breaches their system. A business can make its website as secure as possible, but being 100% protected is just not achievable, say IT experts. Thankfully for UK employment agency Page Group it knew exactly how to react when it suffered a data breach of its cloud computing system in October last year. \"We have senior staff in place from across different parts of our organisation that form an issues management team who are well equipped to deal with a crisis, should it arise,\" says Eamon Collins, Page\\'s group marketing manager. \"That is why when we were alerted to a data breach by our IT vendor Capgemini, this team was able to act fast, review the issue, and provide counsel on the best course of action. \"The most important part of the process is putting your customers\\' interests first.\" He adds: \"Once we had sufficient information around what had happened, and the impact, we could undertake a transparent and open dialogue with the customer.\" At former US mining group National Coal, the crisis it faced was repeated protests in the early 2000s by environmentalists who objected to its opencast mining in east Tennessee. Its then chief executive, Daniel Roling, said the company had plans in place for how it responded to everything it faced - from trespassers, to staff being threatened, entry roads being blockaded, and bomb threats. \"We held a number of run-throughs to test the effectiveness of both communications and operation responses,\" he says. \"The plan should, at a minimum, include an acceptable and effective means of communication, as well as an outline of who can and should provide direction.\" Mr Roling, who left National Coal before it was sold to Ranger Energy Investments in 2010, adds: \"We had everything planned right down to where we would hold a press conference, and how we would set it up. \"In crisis planning, you are looking to create an effective auto-response, so that everyone heads in the right direction, without too much deliberation.\" At UK tourist attraction, the Jorvik Viking Centre, in York, its crisis was a major flood in December 2015 that caused significant damage. Director of attractions Sarah Maltby says the team worked hard to remove precious artefacts before they were damaged. \"Every company needs solid staff to assist, offer advice, and manage elements of disaster recovery,\" she says. The centre is now due to finally reopen in April this year. Crisis management expert Jonathan Bernstein says it is vital that a company responds quickly to a crisis. \"The crisis moves at its own pace, but you need to be faster.\" He adds that firms should be honest about the crisis at hand, especially if it is something they are to blame for, such as a financial scandal. \"Be honest about how you screwed up, and illustrate how you are going to ensure this doesn\\'t happen again,\" says Mr Bernstein. \"Provide clear information to customers on what happened exactly, and what new protocols will be in place.\" Damon Coppola, founder of Shoreline Risk, a company that assists businesses with their risk management, says that when it comes to a firm preparing for a possible crisis \"the public might not necessarily expect perfection\". But he adds: \"[The public\\'s] judgement will be hard if it is perceived that the company failed to act on an obligation to limit or prepare for a known risk, if they were dishonest in their communication, and perhaps in the worst case, if profits came before people.\" These are views echoed by UK public relations expert Benjamin Webb, founder of media relations firm Deliberate PR, which specialises in Swedish start-ups. He says: \"At a time of fast-moving crisis, particularly when people\\'s well-being is at stake, transparency to customers and their family members must exceed any responsibility to shareholders.\" At Toronto-based Ruby Corporation, the owner of Ashley Madison, chief executive Rob Segal, says the company has worked hard to rebuild trust since the 2015 hack. Mr Segal, who joined the firm after the attack, says: \"We partnered with Deloitte\\'s world-leading security team following the breach, and they\\'ve been helping the company with privacy and security enhancements and 24/7 monitoring. \"The go-forward lessons for chief executives is to always stay vigilant about cybersecurity, and to continually invest in privacy and security safeguards.\"'],\n",

       " ['Obituary: Alan Simpson Alan Simpson formed, with Ray Galton, one of the great television scriptwriting partnerships. Alan Simpson formed, with Ray Galton, one of the great television scriptwriting partnerships. Their early work with Tony Hancock pioneered what became known as situation comedy. They went on to create Steptoe and Son, which became the most watched comedy on TV over its 12-year run. But, although they continued to write, they failed to replicate the success of their early work. Alan Simpson was born in Brixton, London on 27 November 1929. After leaving school, he obtained a job as a shipping clerk before contracting tuberculosis. He became so ill that he was not expected to live and was given the last rites. However, he survived, and while a patient in a sanatorium in Surrey he found himself alongside another teenage TB sufferer named Ray Galton. Galton never forgot his first sight of his future partner, 6ft 4in tall with a build to match. \"He was the biggest bloke I\\'d ever seen.\" They discovered a shared love of American humorists such as Damon Runyon and had both listened to the BBC radio comedy programmes Take It From Here and The Goon Shows. Their first work together was for hospital radio. Have You Ever Wondered was based on their experiences in the sanatorium, which was played out in 1949. When Simpson left hospital he was asked by a local church concert party to write a show and he roped in Ray Galton to help. They also began sending one-liners to the BBC, which secured them a job writing for a struggling radio show called Happy-Go-Lucky. The pair also linked up with several other promising new comedy writers and performers of the time, notably Eric Sykes, Peter Sellers, Frankie Howerd and Tony Hancock. They were quickly tiring of the format of radio comedy shows of the time which included music, sketches and one-liners, and hankered after something with more depth. They came up with the idea of comedy where all the humour came from the situations in which characters find themselves. Tony Hancock liked the idea and Hancock\\'s Half Hour was born. It is often credited as the first true radio sitcom, although two other shows of the time, A Life of Bliss and Life with the Lyons, were already using the format in 1954 when Hancock first aired. Over the following five years the writers developed the format, often taking cues from a new generation of playwrights such as John Osborne and Harold Pinter. The pace of each show became slow and more measured, in direct contrast to the speedy wise-cracking delivery of contemporary radio comedians such as Ted Ray. Simpson himself appeared in early episodes as the unknown man who had to suffer Hancock\\'s interminable monologues. In 1956 the series transferred to TV and ran until 1961. The final series was just entitled Hancock and it was that run which featured the best-known shows including The Blood Donor (\"It was either that or join the Young Conservatives\") and The Radio Ham, in which Hancock proves completely incapable of responding to a distress signal from a sinking yachtsman. Hancock, who was becoming increasingly self-critical and drinking heavily, sacked his writers in 1961. Unwilling to lose them, the BBC commissioned them to write scripts for Comedy Playhouse, a series of one-off sitcoms. One play, entitled, The Offer, spawned Steptoe and Son, the tale of two rag-and-bone merchants, a father and son, living in Oil Drum Lane, Shepherd\\'s Bush. The script relied on the clash between the two characters; Albert, the grasping father with none too hygienic personal habits and Harold, his aspirational son who yearns for a better life but never achieves it. The show was unusual in that the two performers, Wilfrid Brambell and Harry H Corbett, were actors rather than comedians. The original four series ran between 1962 and 1965 and the show was revived between 1970 and 1974, during which time two feature film versions were also released. It proved to be the high point for the duo. There was further work with Frankie Howerd and, in 1977, Yorkshire TV attempted to replicate the success of Comedy Playhouse with Galton & Simpson\\'s Playhouse, although none of the episodes produced a series. Simpson quit writing in 1978 to pursue his other business interests although he and Galton remained close friends. In 1996 they reunited to update some of their best-known scripts for the comedian Paul Merton. Simpson blamed their later lack of popularity on the fact that shows were commissioned by armies of managers rather than producers. \"Fifty years ago,\" he said in an interview with the Daily Telegraph, \"if you had an idea, it could be going out in three weeks; the time it took to build the sets. Now it has to go through committees and the process takes years.\" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

       " ['World Cup 2026: Uefa will ask for 16 places for European teams Germany won the World Cup for a fourth time with victory over Argentina in Brazil in 2014 Share this with European football\\'s governing body will ask for its teams to be given 16 places at the expanded 48-team 2026 World Cup. Uefa will also request that the European teams who do qualify are kept apart in the first stage. The new-look tournament will begin with an initial round of 16 three-team groups, with 32 qualifiers going through to the knockout stage. Thirteen European teams qualified for the last World Cup in Brazil in 2014, which was won by Germany. Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin said the requests are \"realistic\", and it is his desire for every European team to qualify from the first round. Fifa is expected to confirm the quotas for each continental governing body in May. Ceferin was speaking at a meeting of the Uefa Executive Committee in Nyon. All members of the committee agreed with the proposals. Other proposals approved at Thursday\\'s meeting included: Media playback is not supported on this device Fifa\\'s members voted unanimously in favour of the World Cup expansion in January. The number of tournament matches will rise to 80, from 64, but the eventual winners will still play only seven games. The tournament will be completed within 32 days - a measure to appease powerful European clubs, who objected to reform because of a crowded international schedule. Fifa president Gianni Infantino said the World Cup has to be \"more inclusive\", adding: \"Football is more than just Europe and South America, football is global.\" Speaking to the BBC at the time of the announcement, he said the decision on who would get the extra qualification slots would be \"looked at speedily\". He added: \"The only sure thing is that everyone will have a bit more representation than they have.\" Speaking on Thursday, Ceferin said: \"We can push and be outvoted, but we think it is realistic to ask for 16 slots at least, plus another condition that each European team is in different groups. \"Then if it is true that we are so good, that quality is on our side, I think all 16 can qualify.\" BBC Radio 5 live sports news correspondent Richard Conway Now we know for certain that Uefa wants at least 16 places in return for support for expanding the World Cup to 48 teams in 2026. But that\\'s not all. It wants one team per group in the first round, enhancing the chances of its member nations making it through to the knockout stages. It\\'s football politics at the sharp end. Uefa\\'s new leader, Aleksander Ceferin, was wily enough to see how strong the support was from other confederations to expand the tournament and he\\'s determined to give his members the best deal possible under the circumstances. Fifa says the final decision on how the extra 16 slots for 2026 will be divided up will be made later this year. But it\\'s an early test for its claim to be a more transparent organisation in light of its scandal-stained past. How will the carve-up be decided? An open and fair process? Or in smoke-filled rooms, far away from public scrutiny? Ceferin\\'s apparent confidence in getting the deal he wants suggests Fifa still has some way to travel on its path to full reform.

Four group winners will progress to promotion play-offs on Saturday, and two nations will then qualify for World Group II play-offs in April - which could see Britain given a home Fed Cup tie for the first time since 1993.

The pair are recovering from leg and rib blows and will be given until match day to prove their fitness. Props Rob Evans and Tomas Francis are the two changes from the 33-7 win over Italy in Rome. Bath number eight Taulupe Faletau, who has not played since Christmas Eve, is named on the bench. Faletau takes the place of Ospreys forward James King and is the only change in personnel from the match-day squad in Rome. It means a vote of confidence for the starting back-row of Sam Warburton, Justin Tipuric and Ross Moriarty. Biggar was replaced by Sam Davies at half-time in Rome after suffering bruised ribs while North played on after suffering a bruised thigh in the second minute. Media playback is not supported on this device Head coach Rob Howley said both players had taken a limited part in training during the week. \"George hasn\\'t done too much this week and Dan has done a couple of sessions,\" said Howley. \"Those two players will be given every opportunity to be fit.

Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, found dead at the age of 45, was head girl in a band of \"It girls\" that sprinkled sparkle and glamour into the newspaper columns of the 1990s. Now, 20 years on, we ask whatever happened to the \"It girl\"? Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, found dead at the age of 45, was head girl in a band of \"It girls\" that sprinkled sparkle and glamour into the newspaper columns of the 1990s. Now, 20 years on, we ask whatever happened to the \"It girl\"? They were Tara, Tamara, Amanda, Isabella - party-loving, bronzed socialites who drank fizz, travelled on private jets and wrestled with disastrous love-lives. They weren\\'t the first of their breed. Nor will they be the last. But, after Tatler magazine put Tara and American socialite Normandie Keith on its front cover in 1996 and dubbed them the \"It girls\", the label stuck. \"It girls\" in the 1990s were ubiquitous, says Wendy Holden, ghostwriter of Tara\\'s witty Sunday Times column which ran in the late 1990s. \"You had to be rich, thin and beautiful. You didn\\'t have a job because you had to spend nights in clubs and bars, and would never have made it into the office the next day. \"You never got upset, you had rich boyfriends, and lived a fairytale life.\" \"You were socially aspirational, often quite posh and aristocratic.\" Kate Reardon who, as fashion director, designed Tatler\\'s \"It girls\" front cover and now edits the magazine, agrees good looks, glamour and charisma were part of the package, but adds: \"It\\'s the indefinable \\'it\\' - you can\\'t define it. \"If you could, everybody else would do it too.\" She also believes a wild side helped. \"That\\'s what made good copy. Well-behaved girls aren\\'t that fascinating.\" Wendy Holden tries to put her finger on why \"It girls\" struck such a chord in the decade that brought us Britpop, Tony Blair and the \"Rachel\" haircut. \"People could not get enough of them. I don\\'t know why - maybe it was a reaction to the ball-breaking 1980s and the austere 1990s. \"People always like glamour. They like to see pictures of beautiful girls having lots of fun. Some admire them, some laugh at them.\" Most of the girls, she says, acknowledged they were a side-shoot of the entertainment industry and ran with it. Tara was very intelligent but, says Holden, I never heard her utter a single political opinion. \"I think she thought it was slightly out of her remit - she was strictly entertainment.\" With that came the assumption that all \"It girls\" were stupid, and it was a tag Tara struggled to shake off. Writing in the Spectator in 1996 at the height of her fame, she said: \"It is agreeable to wake in the morning and find a national newspaper praising one\\'s beauty. \"It is far less agreeable to discover that this praise has been set in the sour old mould of \\'beauty rather than brains\\'. \"As I grow older, I am convinced that the Restoration values of character and wit are what a woman needs to prosper, rather than book-learning.\" Before Tara, there was Jane Asher, a one-time girlfriend of Paul McCartney, in the 1960s, and in the 1980s, it was Koo Stark, best known for her close friendship with Prince Andrew. Today\\'s \"It girls\" are not so very different, says Reardon, although they\\'ve been rebranded. \"Social influencers\" - including party-going models Cara Delevingne and Suki Waterhouse - are still very beautiful and like going out. The difference is they now tend to achieve a lot more, points out Reardon. In the past, they relied on the beneficence of newspaper editors. Now they can take control of their own destiny via Instagram and other social media platforms, she says. It\\'s become more democratic and made it less likely that today\\'s \"It girls\" will have royal or high society connections. But the appeal of these girls is, and always has been, the \"wonderful escapism\" they offer us, says Reardon. The \"It girls\" were always the people to be seen out with in their heyday, but what\\'s happened to them in the years since? Tamara Beckwith Tamara Beckwith, a good friend of Tara\\'s, was one of the best-known \"It girls\" of the 1990s. The London-born socialite went to Cheltenham Ladies\\' College but left after she became pregnant at 16, having a daughter, Anouska, with William Gerhauser, son of the former Playboy businessman Bill Gerhauser. She presented on The Big Breakfast and MTV, dated actors Sylvester Stallone and Charlie Sheen after moving to Los Angeles and later forged a career as a reality TV star, appearing on Dancing On Ice, CelebAir, and Come Dine With Me. Tamara married Italian property heir Giorgio Veroni in 2007 and the couple have two children of their own, daughter Violet and son Vero. Now 46, she co-owns The Little Black Gallery, a boutique gallery in Chelsea specialising in contemporary photography from around the world. Amanda de Cadenet Amanda de Cadenet was the original 1990s \"wild child\", a regular at nightclubs on London\\'s King\\'s Road, all while still a teenager. At 17, she dated Hollywood actor Jack Nicholson, a year later became a co-presenter on late-night Channel 4 show The Word and, at 19, married Duran Duran bassist John Taylor, before later divorcing. In 2006 she married Nick Valensi, the guitarist from The Strokes, with whom she has twins. Now 44 and living in America, Amanda became the host of US TV series The Conversation with Amanda de Cadenet in 2011, interviewing Lady Gaga, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jane Fonda. She even landed an hour-long interview with Hillary Clinton before her campaign to become US president. Normandie Keith Normandie Keith\\'s image as an \"It girl\" was secured when society bible Tatler featured her alongside Tara on the cover of its November 1996 issue. The American oil heiress was a huge hit on the London party scene, when she briefly dated industrialist Lord Hanson\\'s son, Robert. She married polo player Lucas White, a friend of Robert Hanson, in 2000, and had a son, Finn. But after the couple separated, she moved back to America and trained as a yoga teacher in Los Angeles. She told the Daily Telegraph in 2014: \"I giggle when I think I now get up at 4am to practise yoga when I used to go to bed at 4am.\" Lady Victoria Hervey Lady Victoria Hervey and her sister Isabella, daughters of the Marquess of Bristol, were also well known figures in the 1990s and 2000s party set. As a socialite and aristocrat, Lady Victoria enjoyed a privileged life, boarding at Benenden girls\\' school in Kent. After turning down a place at university, she became a model for Christian Dior before opening the Akademi fashion boutique in Knightsbridge with a friend. Like many of her contemporaries she dabbled in TV, having a small part in Absolutely Fabulous before appearing on reality shows, The Farm, Love Island and on Channel 4\\'s The Jump in 2015. Lady Victoria, 41, was also author of Victoria\\'s Secrets, a London party diary column in the Sunday Times, and last year released her first book, Lady in Waiting, the first of a trilogy. Lady Isabella Hervey The younger Hervey sister, Lady Isabella, 34, has also been a model and actress, appearing on TV\\'s Celebrity Love Island before becoming the face of Playboy UK and going on to compete on Celebrity Masterchef. In April 2004 she took part in Channel 4\\'s mock Olympics, The Games, which reignited her love of sport and fitness. She released a workout DVD the following year and since 2007 has run her own business as a personal trainer. In an interview with Metro newspaper she distanced herself from the \"party scene\" and the \"socialite\" label. She said: \"A socialite is someone who goes to all those parties. I don\\'t drink and I hardly ever go out. I\\'m more of a home girl.\" In 2014 Lady Isabella married Belgian businessman Christophe de Pauw, and the couple have a son, Victor Michael Maurice.'],\n",
       " ['A sarcastic response to Syria\\'s militants It takes a special kind of person to run a radio station in an area controlled by Islamist militants in northern Syria. Music is forbidden, so are women presenters. But Raed Fares - manager of Radio Fresh FM - has come up with a creative response to the militants\\' demands. It takes a special kind of person to run a radio station in an area controlled by Islamist militants in northern Syria. Music is forbidden, so are women presenters. But Raed Fares - manager of Radio Fresh FM - has come up with a creative response to the militants\\' demands. It is mid-day and almost time for the latest news from Radio Fresh FM in the rebel-held province of Idlib, in north west Syria. Suddenly the airwaves are filled with assorted sounds of tweeting birds, clucking chickens and bleating goats. As the newsreader gets under way, the cacophony continues beneath his voice. You might be forgiven for thinking that this is some sort of farming bulletin. It\\'s not. It\\'s simply that the station\\'s manager, Raed Fares, has had enough of being told what to do by the powerful jihadist group, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham or JFS - which until last July was linked to al-Qaeda and known as the al-Nusra Front. \"They tried to force us to stop playing music on air,\" says Fares. \"So we started to play animals in the background as a kind of sarcastic gesture against them.\" In what appear to be further acts of sarcastic sabotage aimed at JFS\\'s ban on music, Radio Fresh FM has introduced long sequences of bongs from London\\'s Big Ben clock, endless ticking sounds, ringing explosions and the whistle of shells flying through the air. And instead of songs with melodies, the station now plays recordings of tuneless chanting football fans. Fares has been getting involved in confrontations of one kind or another for years now. He took part in hundreds of demonstrations against Syrian President Bashar Assad\\'s regime at the beginning of the uprising in 2011 and continues to see it as the biggest enemy. Many of his friends were killed or imprisoned, as the authorities responded with increasing violence. Then came the threats from fighters of the so called Islamic State. Like JFS, they said the station\\'s music was haram, or offensive to Islam. Believing this to be totally wrong, Fares ignored the threats and carried on as before, but nearly paid with his life. Just over three years ago, when the 44-year-old former estate agent arrived home in the early hours of the morning, after finishing work at the radio station, two IS gunmen with Kalashnikovs were waiting for him. They fired a barrage of shots, leaving more than a dozen holes in his car, even more in the wall behind, and two in the right side of his body. These shattered several bones in his shoulder and ribs, as well as puncturing his right lung. Fares was left lying in a pool of blood and only narrowly survived after being rushed to hospital by his brother. \"I still have trouble breathing,\" he later said, \"but my doctor says my lungs should be no problem because of the size of my nose.\" It\\'s not that surprising that IS doesn\\'t like Fares. After all, he did once design a poster depicting Syria as an alien with a monster called ISIS exploding out of its chest. The group has since been pushed out of Idlib province. President Assad, though, is his favourite target. He once got his friends to drape themselves in shrouds and then filmed them staggering out of graves calling for Assad to step down, as if even the dead want him gone. He posted it online and it was played on a number of Arabic television stations. Humour, it seems, is never far from the surface with Raed Fares. Take his response to another of JFS\\'s demands, to get rid of women news readers - who are also haram, they say. Has he, I ask him, agreed to swap them for men? \"No, I have another solution for that issue. We simply put their voices through a computer software program which makes them sound like men.\" Though having heard the resulting broadcasts, I would say the women now sound closer to Daleks or robots than men. The feisty 6ft 2in station manager has also refused JFS\\'s demands to allow their members into the radio station to monitor the behaviour of his staff. \"We said \\'No,\\'\" he says. \"You have to monitor the transmissions, not what people are doing inside the radio station.\" JFS are not the only extremist rebels in the area. There are about a dozen others, and even though some of the biggest factions have recently been forming new alliances, this still makes the area chaotic to govern. There is little more than two hours of mains electricity a day, water supplies are limited and food increasingly expensive in a region flooded with 700,000 refugees from elsewhere in the country. The fact that Fares\\'s dispute with JFS has continued for so long is evidence that the group is a little more tolerant than IS. But as a family man with three children is he not worried that sooner or later one of these jihadist groups will kill him? \"They\\'ve tried that five times already,\" he says. \"If it happens, it happens. But they haven\\'t succeeded yet. I try to survive, but if I can\\'t, it\\'s OK.\" He tells me that the lowest point in his life came when one of his closest friends was killed and another severely injured by a bomb last summer. Fares admits that he nearly took his own life in the days that followed. But now, he says, he is more determined than ever to carry on. \"We started the revolution together and were all aware that we faced the same risks,\" he says. \"That means that my life isn\\'t more expensive than my friends who lost their lives.\" Mike Thomson\\'s report about radio Fresh FM ran on the Today programme on 9 February.

       " ['Trump presidency: Opponents boosted by \\'rage donation\\' Donald Trump\\'s adversarial style during the election divided American voters like few campaigns in recent years. Donald Trump\\'s adversarial style during the election divided American voters like few campaigns in recent years. The president himself has referred to \"my many enemies\" - but it seems they\\'re getting a substantial boost from the new president. Organisations that investigate, oppose, or lampoon the commander-in-chief are seeing a surge in support, in what\\'s been dubbed \"rage donation\". From civil rights to media types, the effect is widespread. Planned Parenthood advocates for women\\'s reproductive rights, including abortion - to which Mr Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence are both opposed. Cecile Richards, who leads the family-planning group, told the BBC more than 400,000 people had donated since the election - \"an unprecedented outpouring of support\" - some of which has been given jokily in Mike Pence\\'s name. But, she said, no level of donations would be able to match the federal funding the group receives - something which may now be under threat. \"We will never back down, and we will never stop providing the care our patients need. These doors stay open, no matter what,\" she said. The Centre for Reproductive Rights, meanwhile, is trying to raise $1m in Mr Trump\\'s first 100 days \"We\\'ve had thousands of new donors in the last three months, many of whom have signed on to be monthly sustainers - donors who will be with us for the long haul,\" a spokeswoman said. One of American\\'s biggest environmental protection groups, the National Resources Defence Council (NRDC), was singled out by popular comedian John Oliver late last year when he called on his viewers to donate following the election. Since then, \"we have seen an incredible response from the public,\" a spokeswoman said. The \"huge spike\" continued through November and December, she said, slowing slightly in early January - before picking right back up at the inauguration. \"It\\'s definitely driven by concern over President Trump\\'s anti-environmental rhetoric and actions,\" the NRDC said. The Sierra Club, another major environmental group, reported 11,000 new monthly donors in the days following the election - nine times its previous record. Saturday Night Live (and Alec Baldwin) It\\'s not just charities and fundraising that are seeing a positive bump from Trump. This week, it emerged that the long-running satire show Saturday Night Live was celebrating its highest ratings in decades. Its numbers have grown by 22% overall - to 10 million viewers, the highest since 1995, according to Variety. Alec Baldwin\\'s portrayal of Mr Trump, which became wildly popular during the campaign, is now a weekly staple. Strident Trump critic Stephen Colbert also beat his late-night rival, Jimmy Fallon, for the first time in years in recent ratings - though there\\'s not yet enough evidence to link late-night show ratings to politics. You may also like ... Perhaps the biggest success story comes from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). In a single weekend - as they fought a legal battle against the president\\'s controversial immigration order - the group clocked up $24m ($19.1m) in donations, six times what it usually receives in an entire year. The huge amount prompted the rights group to turn to Silicon Valley for help managing the funds. Groups like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the National Immigration Law Center have also benefited from social media campaigns. Comedian Josh Gondelman, for example, felt uncomfortable with Mr Trump\\'s close ties to the Patriots American football team. So he came up with the idea of donating $100 to the NAACP every time his team scored a touchdown during the Super Bowl. Coupled with a social-friendly hashtag (#AGoodGame), the idea took off, and brought in thousands of dollars in donations for civil rights groups across the US. President Trump likes to tweet about the (\"dishonest, lying\") media. Most news outlets would say they don\\'t oppose the president - but by nature, question and hold authority to account. But amid outcry over \"alternative facts\" and talk of non-existent massacres, many are reporting more readers and subscriptions. Non-profit public interest news organisation ProPublica said it had seen \"a dramatic increase in donations, beginning late on election night\". Donor numbers swelled from 3,400 in all of 2015 to more than 26,000 in 2016, the organisation\\'s president Dick Tofel said. And recurring monthly donations jumped from $4,500 in October, just before the election, to $104,000 in January. \"It seems that the election has caused a large number of people to want to take various forms of civic action. We\\'re very flattered that many of them think of ProPublica - and investigative journalism in the public interest generally - in that connection,\" Mr Tofel said. He stressed it was not clear that this was tied to \"particular steps\" taken by Mr Trump, but noted that donations picked up in January from inauguration day. But the same bump was seen in private newspapers too. The (\"failing, wrong, so false\") New York Times, which the president said should fix its \"dwindling\" numbers, actually added 276,000 digital subscriptions in the last quarter - the biggest jump since it brought in a paywall. And the (\"angry, boring\") Washington Post reported almost 100 million users on its website in both October and November last year, \"greatly exceeding previous traffic records\". Meanwhile, subscriptions to the Wall Street Journal jumped 300% on the day after the election, and it reported 70% growth in new digital subscriptions year on year. US voters chose Mr Trump - he won by a large margin in the electoral college system although he did not win the popular vote. Despite a slip in approval ratings, he appears to retain plenty of popular support. It\\'s still too early to know if his policies have had a positive impact, but his supporters remain steadfast. Conservative news outlets such as Breitbart have surged in popularity, and Mr Trump\\'s supporters have boycotted brands such as Kellogg\\'s or Budweiser which are perceived to have taken a political stance against the president. Mr Trump\\'s unique style of Twitter diplomacy, however, has had a direct negative impact on some companies. Shortly after taking office, the new president tweeted that Boeing\\'s costs for Air Force One were \"out of control\", dropping their stock value. A similar tongue-lashing on fighter jets dropped Lockheed Martin\\'s stock by more than 4%. Now, that effect already seems to be waning - as Fortune magazine pointed out, when the president struck out at retailer Nordstrom for dropping his daughter\\'s fashion line, its stock actually rallied. It may be that Mr Trump\\'s rhetoric is no longer having the effect it once did, and is becoming a normal part of politics.

The 42-year-old stage manager used to be a regular shopper at the High Street chain, but now she tends to go to Boots instead. And she\\'s not alone. Its owner, cosmetics giant L\\'Oreal, wants to offload the High Street chain, which has been suffering slowing sales. The Body Shop, founded by Dame Anita Roddick in 1976, was a pioneer using natural ingredients for its beauty products when it started out. It initially thrived, expanding rapidly, and by the 1980s was one of the most well-known brands on the High Street. I remember the chain fondly from my youth, when it seemed to be an exciting shop full of affordable, fun and exciting products. Coloured animal soaps, banana shampoo, white musk perfume and strawberry shower gel were the height of 1980s beauty chic as far as I was concerned. But by the early 2000s, rivals had caught up, with firms such as Boots, for example, developing similar natural beauty ranges. New challengers such as Lush also emerged, encroaching on The Body Shop\\'s market share. The chain is still a sizeable High Street presence with more than 3,000 stores in 66 countries and employs 22,000 people, according to its website. The Body Shop\\'s results for 2016 show total sales were 920.8m euros (?783.8m), down from 967.2m euros in 2015, which L\\'Oreal blamed on market slowdowns in Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia. The sales were a tiny proportion of L\\'Oreal\\'s overall 25.8bn euros of sales for the same period. And arguably the chain - which L\\'Oreal bought for ?652m ($1.14bn) in 2006 - remains a lower-end and insignificant part of its huge portfolio of brands, which include skincare specialists Kiehl\\'s, Lancome and Garnier, as well as fashion brands Ralph Lauren and Giorgio Armani. Veteran retail analyst Richard Hyman argues that L\\'Oreal overpaid for the chain and has failed to add any value to it. \"Frankly it\\'s a bit of mystery them buying it in the first place. \"What they bought is a retailer and what they\\'re good at is brands,\" he says. He thinks The Body Shop\\'s struggles are down to the same issues facing the retail sector as a whole: \"Retailing in shops is becoming an increasingly challenging business. You\\'ve got to have a very compelling retail proposition as opposed to a brand or product proposition. \"Everyone that shops in The Body Shop spends most of their personal care budget somewhere else. They\\'re constantly chasing their tail, having to work hard to attract people into a store,\" he says. When the 2006 deal was struck, founder Dame Anita - who died just a year later - was forced to reject claims that The Body Shop, known for its ethically sourced goods, was joining with \"the enemy\". There were concerns that some of the ingredients L\\'Oreal then used in its products had been tested on animals, while The Body Shop was publicly opposed to animal testing. The French firm insisted the brand would complement its existing offering, giving it increased presence in the \"masstige\" sector - mass market combined with prestige. But Charlotte Pearce, an analyst at consultancy GlobalData Retail, believes the firm has \"slightly lost its way\" under L\\'Oreal\\'s ownership. \"While The Body Shop\\'s heritage is strong, it needs to work on its brand perception. It\\'s not known as a brand which is innovative and new, and it\\'s failed to keep up with market trends - contour sticks, kits and palettes were a strong trend in 2016, and these are nowhere to be seen in The Body Shop\\'s range,\" she says. These days the firm is not seen as \"a trendy brand\", but mostly as a shop for gifting and low-value items, such as its body butters and body lotions, she says. \"With premium retailers such as Jo Malone and Liz Earle offering in-store treatments, there is more that The Body Shop could be doing to raise its profile and improve the customer experience,\" she adds. Nonetheless, Prof John Colley from Warwick Business School believes there will still be plenty of interest from private equity funds. He expects the firm to be sold with its current separate management team, who he says are likely to have their own ideas for how to improve it. \"When a major corporate has decided it doesn\\'t want a business, it will sell it, probably, whatever the price. \"They [L\\'Oreal] are trying to get rid of it because it\\'s underperforming. But anyone bidding will see a clear turnaround. Independent ownership would probably serve the firm well. A refreshed image would almost certainly work,\" he says. Mr Hyman, too, believes a new owner could improve The Body Shop, particularly by selling the chain\\'s products outside its own shops. But he says trying to offload the large store estate with long committed leases will be a hindrance to any buyer. \"That\\'s not to say it isn\\'t a business with potential, but it could perform much more strongly,\" he says. Dame Anita Roddick, who founded the firm in 1976 at the age of 34, said her original motivation for the firm was simply to make a living for herself and her two daughters while her husband was away travelling. But as someone who had travelled widely, she set out to do things differently, relying on natural ingredients and her customers\\' interest in the environment. \"Why waste a container when you can refill it? And why buy more of something than you can use? We behaved as she [my mother] did in the Second World War, we reused everything, we refilled everything and we recycled all we could. \"The foundation of The Body Shop\\'s environmental activism was born out of ideas like these,\" she wrote.'],\n",
       " ['Has Tom Hiddleston damaged his brand? Tom Hiddleston has had a mixed time of late. Tom Hiddleston has had a mixed time of late. In September, he and former girlfriend Taylor Swift broke up after three months together amid accusations their relationship was a publicity stunt. Then, in January, he apologised for an \"inelegantly expressed\" winner\\'s speech at the Golden Globes in which he referred to aid workers in South Sudan \"binge-watching\" The Night Manager. This time last year, Hiddleston was riding the crest of a wave. After starring in hugely successful BBC drama The Night Manager as well as the big-screen adaption of JG Ballard\\'s High-Rise, he was a hot favourite to be the next James Bond. But have his off-screen actions since done damage to his brand? \"Some of the recent headlines have been unhelpful,\" admits Mark Borkowski, a strategic PR consultant. \"There are events that happen and they\\'re not thought-through properly, and the nature of being caught up with Taylor Swift\\'s gang and not thinking it through strategically has undone him. \"Sometimes people don\\'t recognise the power of their brand, and often you can\\'t conduct yourself in the way you think you can.\" But Steven Gaydos, vice-president and executive editor of Variety, thinks Hiddleston is still a hot property, despite his recent PR mishaps. \"I don\\'t think anything he\\'s done to date has put any serious dent into his career,\" he told the BBC. \"He\\'s a fantastic actor doing fantastic work. He has a fan-base and he\\'s delivering the goods. \"These are just missteps - somebody doing something that causes chatter. In this case Tom Hiddleston made a speech and people thought it was silly, or he dated a woman and people thought it was a little bogus. \"He\\'s not going to be hauled in front of the courts for any of this.\" Nonetheless, it\\'s fair to say \"Hiddle-Swift\" brought Tom a great deal of negative attention. Some fans thought the couple were being suspiciously open about their relationship, leading to accusations that all was not what it seemed. Hiddleston has now defended his relationship with Swift in an interview with GQ, saying: \"Of course it was real.\" He also said the \\'I â\\x99?T.S. [Taylor Swift]\\' tank top he was photographed wearing was \"a joke\", explaining he was lent it by a friend to protect a graze from the sun. The actor said the pictures of him wearing the shirt were taken \"without consent or permission\", and that fans and the media had \"no context\". \"I was just surprised that it got so much attention,\" he said. \"The tank top became an emblem of this thing.\" So is this latest interview simply damage limitation? \"Absolutely,\" says Mark Borkowski. \"I don\\'t think Tom Hiddleston knew at the time just how big a brand he was. Now he does know that and has to think carefully. \"This GQ interview is an example of putting the record straight and trying to get a narrative together to try and recover from some poorly judged moments.\" Borkowski adds: \"There\\'s a beautiful naivety about Tom Hiddleston that is projected through this interview where he\\'s trying to talk directly to his fans. This is material you put there for them.\" Hiddleston himself admits in the interview: \"A relationship in the limelight takes work. And it\\'s not just the limelight. It\\'s everything else. \"And I\\'m still trying to work out a way of having a personal life and protecting it, but also without hiding.\" Gaydos has a lot of sympathy for the 36-year-old on the Taylor Swift front. \"Imagine you just met someone and you\\'re having a relationship and the whole world is watching. It\\'s like snakes all around you,\" he says. \"I\\'d hate to to live in a fish bowl and have every move analysed, with people saying you\\'re a fraud, your relationship is a fraud, everything you\\'re doing is insincere and fake.\" Hiddleston has two films coming out later this year - Thor: Ragnarok and Kong: Skull Island. Gaydos says the film studios won\\'t be particularly worried about Hiddleston\\'s off-screen actions. \"They\\'re worrying about the tracking. If the trailer goes out for Kong and the response isn\\'t strong or the awareness of the movie isn\\'t high, that\\'s what they\\'re really concerned about,\" he says. \"Tom has not ventured anywhere near the space where we\\'ve seen stars screw up their careers and really damage their star wattage.\" Borkowski adds: \"Anything is recoverable in this day and age. \"Last week we were hearing about the death of the David Beckham brand, but we\\'d forgotten about it by Thursday. \"Things move so quickly now, so it is always about recovery.\" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

       " ['Ketchup debate: To chill or not to chill... Our fridges are stuffed with food that could also be kept in the cupboard. In the past, people kept butter, eggs and sauces in the pantry without getting ill. So why do many of us insist on keeping it all chilled? Our fridges are stuffed with food that could also be kept in the cupboard. In the past, people kept butter, eggs and sauces in the pantry without getting ill. So why do many of us insist on keeping it all chilled? A supermarket has begun stocking ketchup in the fridge section as well as on shelves in a bid to appease both camps. Asda\\'s poll of some 2,600 people found opinion was split, with 54% saying ketchup belonged in the cupboard and 46% saying they stored it in the fridge. Some shoppers took to social media to say which part of the shop they would be heading towards. But Polly Russell, a food historian from BBC Two\\'s Back In Time For Dinner, said modern-day food chilling could be \"bizarre\". Many brands we recognise today, such as Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce, HP Sauce and Heinz Tomato Ketchup, were all sold before households had fridges, she explains. \"They were absolute life-savers for housekeepers - adding flavour to food that might be slightly bland or monotonous,\" Dr Russell said. Their acidity levels, coupled with salt and sugar content, means they were - and still are - microbiologically safe to keep at room temperature. \"Households had no fridge, only cool boxes, or ice deliveries if it was a wealthy family.\" In the latest series of Further Back In Time For Dinner, the Robshaw family are sent to a 1900s house - finding a kitchen with a cool-cupboard and overstuffed parlour instead of a fridge or freezer. So when did this change? As late as 1961, 20% of British households had a fridge, Dr Russell\\'s research found. Yet half of these households probably owned a television. It was only from 1968 that half of Britons owned a fridge. Nearly 70 years on, we are fridge-obsessed. Ms Russell said there was now an \"increased anxiety\" over food safety, meaning that we tend to chill foods when we do not need to. \"Shoppers don\\'t trust the food they buy and hear mixed messages about what is and isn\\'t safe,\" she said. But some people are attempting to resist our reliance on refrigeration. \"If we get more people into preserving food, we can reduce the need for a fridge,\" says Caroline Aitken, a food preservation teacher from Dartmoor. Mrs Aitken, 38, teaches \"permaculture\", a movement that began in the 1970s and promotes self-sufficiency, growing food naturally and minimising waste. \"We\\'ve gradually lost our larders and now we\\'ve got very hot centrally heated houses,\" she said, adding that there was a \"cultural fear\" of leaving food out of the fridge. She suggests pickling food from scratch using salt and water and keeping sugary preserves such as jam in the larder. \"Sauerkraut and kimchee are great to experiment with,\" she said. \"I generally add three tablespoons of salt for every two kilos of shredded vegetables.\" Mrs Aitken says people can go \"over the top\" with keeping food in the fridge, even once it has been cooked. \"You can have cold-store outside,\" she said. \"If I\\'ve cooked a big stew I sit the pot in a room with a stone floor and it\\'s perfectly fine to have the next day.\" According to the government, the electricity costs of running a fridge bought in 2013 over a 12.5-year lifespan will total about ?270, although it may be difficult to do without one altogether. Even Mrs Aitken says she keeps some things, like her homemade yoghurt, in the fridge. \"I just don\\'t go over the top: tomatoes, citrus fruits, eggs, they shouldn\\'t be in there.\" Sources: NHS Food Safety advice, Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences journal We would like to see what\\'s inside your fridge, whether it\\'s edible or not.

He performed it live for the first time on Jo Whiley\\'s BBC Radio 2 show on Wednesday night - but ahead of the session, he sat down with BBC News to talk about the story behind the song (and Elton John\\'s helicopter). Up-and-coming soul star Jodie Abacus has just released a powerful song about the refugee crisis. He performed it live for the first time on Jo Whiley\\'s BBC Radio 2 show on Wednesday night - but ahead of the session, he sat down with BBC News to talk about the story behind the song (and Elton John\\'s helicopter). Pop is getting a long overdue dose of politics. Lady Gaga issued a subtle rebuke to Donald Trump at Sunday\\'s Super Bowl, singing the protest anthem This Land Is Your Land and quoting from the pledge of allegiance. Pop trio Muna were more explicit. Appearing on Jimmy Kimmel\\'s chat show this week, they added a new verse to their single I Know A Place. The final line? \"He\\'s not my leader even if he\\'s my president.\" In the UK, Stormzy prompted an overhaul of the Brits after pointing out the ceremony\\'s lack of diversity in his song One Take Freestyle. Called Keep Your Head Down, it tells the story of a family fleeing a war zone, only to be met with fear and suspicion in the country they had thought would provide safe harbour. \"I focused on Syria when I was writing,\" he says, \"but there\\'s a load of places in the world that are going through the same thing.\" Why did you decide to write about the refugee crisis? I was in LA for a session, and I saw something about refugees on the television in my hotel. That\\'s what triggered it. I wanted to give a perspective of what it would be like to go from one country to another. I can only imagine it\\'s a terrifying feeling. We need to be a little bit more empathetic. How did you write the lyrics? The beat of the song triggered the emotion in me. The first lyric was the chorus: \"We\\'re moving on, but the road is long / Don\\'t get your hopes up, you\\'d better keep your head down.\" Don\\'t get your hopes up is the father saying \"we\\'re running out of chances\", and keep your head down was like, \"pray that we get out of this\". I\\'d assumed it was about having to keep a low profile in a new country. It\\'s both. There\\'s a lot of double meanings. It\\'s also about keeping your head down to escape the bullets. The thing is, you do all this to save your life - then you\\'re not accepted by the country where you thought you\\'d be safe. People hate you or they think you\\'re going to steal their jobs or take their benefits. But there\\'s a lot of people running away just to save their own souls. Your musical references are very eclectic. I hear Stevie Wonder, ELO, Steely Dan, even Hall & Oates in there. How did you get into music? I was born in south-east London in Lewisham Hospital. My dad used to be a DJ. He\\'d carry around these big speakers and play reggae, soul, funk. I was just surrounded by music. What was the first time you performed in public? I gave a foyer concert at college. What I\\'d done was reproduce the Jacksons\\' Show You the Way to Go on a little computer, and I\\'d written my own lyrics to it. No one really knew I could sing - I wasn\\'t one of the stand-out guys in college - but I thought, \"OK, I\\'ll give it a go\". And all of a sudden there were people watching from on top, people crowding round the sides. At the end they were all like, \"Oh my gosh, he can sing!\". It sounds like a scene from a movie. It was actually quite nuts. What inspired you to write your own music? There was a lot of trauma. My mum and dad divorced and I missed out on a lot of things because I had to go to court. Being creative took my mind off what was going on. So there was a custody battle? They were fighting over me and my younger brother and it got nasty. It was harsh. Not a lot of people, not even your parents, understand how the kids suffer, mentally. When you\\'re that age you trust your parents and suddenly this black hole of chaos opens up. But that\\'s what built my character, in terms of deciding I wanted to do music. But you studied acting at college, is that right? Yeah, I got my diploma in performing arts and I loved it. Why did you decide to pursue music instead? I literally decided on a notepad. I drew two big arrows in blue biro, one for music and one for acting. I wrote little notes about what I wanted to do... and I wanted to make great music. I didn\\'t know any notes, I didn\\'t know anything. I was just going with my feelings. You\\'re in your mid-30s now, so it certainly hasn\\'t been an overnight success. What happened? You leave college, you get a job, you get another job - but all that time you\\'re taking the money you earn and you\\'re investing it in the thing you want to do. There\\'s always times where you think it\\'s going to be your turn, but it just doesn\\'t happen. How close did you come to giving up? You get tormented a lot. You get tormented to the point of thinking, \"why do I keep going?\" - but then you realign yourself. There\\'s nothing worse than hearing an old person say, \"Oh, I wish I\\'d done this or that\". When I\\'m in my rocking chair eating apple crumble and custard, I want to say I had no regrets. Your big breakthrough was a song called I\\'ll Be That Friend. How did that song arrive? Three years ago, I came down with pneumonia and almost died. I was bedridden for about three months and, in the middle of all that, I finished with my ex. She moved on to another dude, like, really quickly. I saw pictures of them kissing and, even though I\\'d broken up with her, it was still a shock. At the end of that year, I needed to be comforted. I needed someone to say, \"it\\'s going to be alright\\'. It didn\\'t matter who it was. I just needed someone. I\\'d never felt that way before, but I needed a hug. Those feelings all came out in the song. As I was writing it, I was crying and singing at the same time. And yet that song, like a lot of your music, is very positive. Was that something you felt pop was lacking? Yeah. I feel there\\'s a fun element missing. Everyone\\'s thinking about the formula of how to write a hit song. I don\\'t. Music is such a spiritual thing, it has to move you. You\\'ve been getting a lot of support from Elton John on his Beats 1 show. What did you make of that? That\\'s incredible. He\\'s one of my heroes. He\\'s given me a couple of proper big shout-outs. And you\\'ve covered Bennie and the Jets in concert. That was nuts. He was meant to show up - but he didn\\'t because the cloud level was low and his helicopter couldn\\'t land. Wow. First world problems. Haha. Right? So is there an album on the way? Yeah, it\\'s called Take This and Grow Flowers - because I\\'m using every little traumatic memory as fertiliser, and then making it grow. All of these things, all of these problems I\\'ve had... every memory is like a seed. What\\'s the best thing about success? I love travelling. I love the adventure. There\\'s not a day where I\\'m not thankful. I\\'m happy that Radio 2 have supported me as much as they have done. Have you become a connoisseur of hotel rooms? I\\'m not that fussy. I get annoyed when there\\'s no kettle. It\\'s not just for tea - I use it to steam clothes, and it\\'s useful for steaming your voice as well. But do you know what? I always get paranoid that someone\\'s done a wee in it. I always wash it out, just in case. Jodie Abacus\\'s single Keep Your Head Down is out now. His debut album follows later this year.

North Ossetian architect Vitaly Kaloyev who lost his wife and two children in the 2002 mid-air collision over south Germany said the makers of the new Hollywood movie \"aftermath\"?based on the tragedy, which stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, did not contact him. \"I have no idea what the movie is about,\" Kaloyev told TASS. \"The filmmakers did not contact me and did not consult with me, so it\\'s too early to make any comments on this motion picture. I will think about it, when I see the film.\" \"aftermath\"?is a drama thriller directed by Elliott Lester that will be released on April 7. North Ossetian senator Taimuraz Mamsurov said a film based on this tragedy should had been made much earlier and complained that no thorough investigation into the air crash had been conducted. \"There was no investigation. They (European officials) just said that they had paid compensation to each of the victims\\' families, they told us to go back to Russia, bury the remains and go our separate ways,\" Mamsurov stated. On July 1, 2002, Bashkirian Airlines Flight 2937, a Tu-154 passenger jet and a Boeing 757 cargo jet collided in mid-air over the southern German town of Uberlingen. All 69 passengers and crew aboard the Tu-154 and the two crew members aboard the Boeing 757 were killed. Two years later, Peter Nielsen, the air traffic controller on duty at the time of the collision, was murdered by Kaloyev. In October 2005, Kaloyev was convicted of the murder by a Swiss court and sentenced to eight years in jail. In November 2007, he was released from prison for exemplary behavior and returned to his home city of Vladikavkaz in North Ossetia. He was later appointed North Ossetia\\'s deputy minister of architecture and construction and retired a year ago.'],\n",

The athletes subjected to the provisional suspensions are four male skiers, namely Alexander Legkov, Maxim Vylegzhanin, Yevgeny Belov and Alexey Petukhov and two female skiers - Julia Ivanova and Evgenia Shapovalova.

On February 2, there was a public meeting of the Security Council, and it was impossible to miss that the atmosphere of discussion was a far cry from what it used to be. In fact, only two delegations supported Ukraine - the UK and the US, while the rest urged a political settlement and the implementation of the Minsk accords, which is exactly what we are pushing for,\" Churkin said in an interview for Kommersant daily.   According to the diplomat, the Syrian settlement and tackling terrorism is obviously another top priority issue the Security Council is facing now. \"We expect a logical call by US President Donald Trump for uniting efforts to counter the Islamic State (terrorist group outlawed in Russia) will retransmit into concrete approaches to the whole Syrian settlement track, which will help reach a positive outcome,\" he said. \"The United States can join in on the measures, which are already being assumed, you may be aware of the fact that We\\'re invited the Americans to the meeting in Astana headed by Russia, Turkey and Iran,\" Churkin added, admitting though that it would be rather challenging to \"seriously get ahead without a positive and more or less active role of the United States.\" When asked to comment the intention of the new US administration to slash its payments to the United Nations by 40%, he said that \"the UN is not a gift by the United States to the world, but an international structure, which plays a crucial role in the settling regional and worldwide political, social and economic issues, without it, the global community would have had to solve them separately, which would be less efficient and more costly.\" On the other hand, he added, \"there are statutory and voluntary payments within the UN, and if the United States failed to make statutory payments this would first of all hurt Washington\\'s image, not to mention the existing rule that if a country\\'s indebtedness exceeds its two-year contribution, it is divested of UN General Assembly vote.\" - Representatives from Russia, Iran, Turkey and Jordan are expected to put an end to the issue of divided Syrian opposition to moderate and radical groups at their meeting in Astana scheduled for February 15-16. Experts think this will seriously expedite both the task of tackling terrorists and holding peaceful talks, Izvestia wrote.   According to the newspaper\\'s informed source in military and diplomatic circles, Russia and its partners in Astana talks are determined to define the lists of \"\\x98moderate\"?and \"\\x98radical\"?groups of the Syrian opposition during the next round of the negotiations. The former are considered as potential participants in the peace talks, while the latter will be targeted for a resounding defeat, the source added. \"On Monday, the main criteria for assessment of the groups were set - their involvement in terrorist activities, dealing with civilians and ideology,\" he said, adding that considering the \"assumption that not all fundamentalist groups should be viewed as radical and terrorist as the main breakthrough.\" \"The key task for now is to divide the groups, which used to be part of the former Jabhat al-Nusra and Ahrar al-Sham(terror groups, outlawed in Russia),\" the source said. According to Elena Suponina, an advisor to the Director of the Russian Institute of Strategic Studies, the move to differentiate between moderate and radical opposition may kill three birds with one stone. \"First, this will make the war against with terrorists easier for all sides, as the military will understand which positions are permitted to be bombed and which are not,\" she told Izvestia. Second, \"\\x98moderate\"?groups will be able to join the peace process,\" Suponina said. \"They will have to stop hostilities, sit down to talk with the government and agree the settlement\\'s parameters,\" she said. \"Finally, the dispute between international players regarding which opposition representatives should be considered as terrorists will clear up, which will seriously facilitate cooperation towards a peace process with Turkey, Iran and Jordan, and potentially - with the United States and the countries of the Persian Gulf. - German Member of European Parliament-and member of the delegation for relations with the United States, Bernd Koelmel, told Izvestia daily that the political views of the country\\'s Chancellor Angela Merkel are dangerous for the stability of not only Germany bur other European countries as well. \"In everyday life Angela Merkel is a very good person, but regarding political issues she encourages stagnation, does not take into account the opinion of German citizens and stands for further centralization of the European Union. This particularly concerns her policy regarding the European currency, migrants and nuclear energy,\" he said, adding that the country will pursue a shortfall policy in case Merkel wins the election. Speaking about the relations between the EU and the United States, the MEP said that the two \"are very important strategic partners.\" \"Much depends on the decisions that will be made during the talks between institutions and EU countries\"?leaders on the one hand and Donald Trump\\'s administration on the other. \"For Trump as a new player on the political arena, it is necessary to get in contact with the European Union as a guarantor of peace, stability and welfare on the European continent,\" Koelmel said. \"In the economic sphere as well as the issues of safety and freedom, the partnership between the EU and the US is top priority.

Gatilov went on to say that Moscow considered the recent Astana meeting on Syria (held on January 23-24) to be \"an important step aimed at boosting efforts for settling the Syrian conflict.\" \"First, the armed opposition groups have joined the process, particularly, the talks on Syria\\'s future, while they had been refusing to build any contacts with the government,\" the diplomat noted. \"Second, an important conclusion was made in Astana, as everybody agreed that there was no military solution to the Syrian conflict.\"   Besides, the Russian deputy foreign minister pointed out that the meeting\\'s participants had confirmed the ceasefire established in accordance with an agreement reached on December 29, while a trilateral mechanism for monitoring the ceasefire and investigating ceasefire violations had been set up by Russia, Iran and Turkey. \"It was made clear that all the efforts aimed to advance the search for a political solution made in Astana would contribute to the intra-Syrian talks in Geneva under the United Nations auspices in accordance with the UN Security Council Resolution 2254,\" Gatilov said. \"One of the positive results of the Astana meeting is that it gave a much-needed impetus to the process, encouraging the United Nations to boost their activities.\"   Gatilov also said that unnecessary delays in talks \"are harmful for the settlement process.\" \"This is why since no talks under UN auspices have been taking place, new initiatives emerged,\" he explained. \"Of course, it would be better if all these efforts were carried out under a single umbrella but for that long pauses in dialogue should be avoided.\" - \"We are convinced that participants in the talks should stop going around in circles and tackle specific issues in accordance with the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254,\" the high-ranking Russian diplomat concluded. - -'],\n",

According to earlier reports, Russia and Japan might enter into official consultations over joint economic activity in the South Kuril Islands in March.

Kishida said that the Council was expected to make preparations for an early visit to Russia by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Russia\\'s Minister for the Development of the Far East, Aleksandr Galushka, confirmed that his ministry was getting ready for consultations, too, and would make its own proposals for joint economic activity by Russia and Japan in the South Kurils.   According to some sources, the Council is expected to consider specific projects for cooperation in the South Kuril Islands, including fishing, the production of seafood, tourism and nature conservation. As it has been repeatedly stated, such partnership should not cast doubt over the fundamental positions of Russia and Japan regarding sovereignty over the islands. When Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Japan on December 15-16, the two parties agreed to start consultations on joint economic activity in the southern part of the Kuril Archipelago. In March, Tokyo is to host the first round of consultations at the deputy foreign minister level. Attempts at negotiating joint economic activity on the islands were made in the late 1990s.

A three-tier system of banking regulation in Russia makes possible to maximize satisfaction of demands of banking services consumers in Russia, Chairperson of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina told TASS in an interview.   \"A three-tier system is created for the economy to have financial institutions capable of maximizing satisfaction of consumer needs. Regional banks are working with small and medium enterprises locally, know their history and have more opportunities to interact with borrowers on an individual basis. Major banks are often losing in respect of this category clients: by virtue of operating techniques of large banks and scoring models,\" Nabiullina said. Identification of several tiers in the banking system is a fairly common approach in the global practice, she added. Financial rehabilitation of Russian banking sector may take several years more, the Central Bank chief said.- \"The period of proactive recovery of the banking system will continue for some more time. We hope to reach a situation when there will be very few revocations of licenses annually. However, this will take several years more,\" she said. The floating ruble rate does not merely provide for absorption of external shocks but it-also balances interests of different market participants:- \"I am absolutely confident the rate should be floating. Further to the opportunity of the floating rate to absorb external shocks, it also balances interests of different market participants. When it is said the economy needs weak [ruble] rate, the assumption is made on the basis of the opinion of commodities exporters. However, enterprises exist that want to purchase imported equipment for upgrade; they are interested in strong ruble. Therefore we believe the rate should be a market one and balance diverse interests,\" Nabiullina has stressed.- The Bank of Russia estimates the oil price range to be $40-55 per barrel in recent years, Nabiullina told TASS: \"We believe now the average price can be above $40 this year. This is largely the consequence of the agreement with the OPEC. The range of fluctuations in coming years can be estimated as $40-55 per barrel. The oil price will depend on many factors, including the US policy on the energy market, the response of shale oil producers to a new market situation, and on prospects of extending the agreement with the OPEC. The demand response, particularly in China, is also highly important in terms of oil prices growth. We will thorough evaluate these factors in the next outlook.\" The Bank of Russia intends to implement the three-tier system of the domestic banking sector since January 1, 2018 and complete the system setup by early 2019:- \"We plan to introduce the three-tier system since January 1, 2018. A one-year transitional period will start since then, when the banks should determine the category they want to work in. Thus the three-tier system of the banking system is to be established by the beginning of 2019,\" Nabiullina said. The regulator suggests identifying three tiers of credit institution within the framework of the new regulation mode:- \"[These are] systemic credit institutions, which will continue working under existing rules. [They are followed by] universal banks, which can perform all kinds of operations, including international ones, but are regulated in full scope in line with Basel standards. Minimal requirements to the equity of universal banks are increased to 1 bln rubles [$16.9 mln]. The third type comprises banks with basic licenses, whose equity may start from 300 mln rubles [$5 mln]; they will mostly service individuals, small and medium business,\" she said. The Bank of Russia suggests significant simplification in regulation for such banks because the level of risks assumed by them will be lower and they will not have the need to perform complex transactions, particularly the international ones, Nabiullina said. -Russia\\'s Central Bank estimates the impact of the Finance Ministry interventions on liquidity of the banking sector as neutral, Elvira Nabiullina said.- \"Of course, when we manage liquidity of the banking sector we will take into account purchase and sale of currencies by the Finance Ministry. According to our estimates, the impact of these operations on liquidity will be neutral,\" she said.   According to her, the Finance Ministry carries out the purchase of currency as part of application of the transitional fiscal rule and these activities should not be regarded as foreign currency interventions aimed at influencing the ruble nominal rate. Nabiullina said that the structural surplus liquidity of the banking sector was achieved thanks to the fact that the Finance Ministry is financing the budget deficit from the Reserve Fund. The head of the Central Bank noted that the transition to the liquidity surplus is not steady and a lack of liquidity still may occur on the market. According to Nabiullina, this will depend on the rate of budget spending and the banks strategy to replenish reserves. She promised to the bankers that the Central Bank will respond flexibly to the situation with liquidity. Earlier this month, the Finance Ministry announced currency purchase operations using 113.1 bln rubles ($1.9 bln) in February. The currency will be purchased using extra oil and gas revenues. Daily volume of currency purchases will be 6.3 bln rubles ($105.9 mln) from February 7 to March 6.  '],\n",

A traditional ceremony marking the 113th anniversary since the naval battle between the Japanese and Russian naval forces in the Chemulpo Bay off the Korean shores was held in the Yellow Sea off Incheon on Thursday. The ceremony was attended by Russian Ambassador in South Korea Alexander Timonin, officers of the military attache\\'s office, diplomats, students of the Russian embassy\\'s school, and South Korean navy officers. A Korean corvette took the Russians to the place where the Russian cruiser Varyag and the gunboat Korietz had sunk.  Outstanding ships of the Russian Navy  \"The heroic exploit of the Russian sailors will stay in our memory for ever. Today we lay flowers at the place where the ship, which has become a symbol of valor, selflessness and commitment to the military duty, sank,\" Timonin said, lowering a wreath into the sea to the sound of trumpets. The Varyag became a legend in Russia and many other countries during the Russian-Japanese war of 1904, when it took part in the battle of Chemulpo on January 27, 1904, engaging in a heroic and uneven fight with a squadron of fifteen Japanese ships. The battle lasted about an hour. The crew of the Varyag sent to the sea floor a Japanese destroyer and damaged severely two cruisers. The Varyag itself got five underwater scuttles and lost three guns. An officer and thirty sailors were killed and another six officers and 85 sailors were severely wounded or shell-shocked. The Varyag was incapacitated at the end of the battle and it returned to the port of Chemulpo together with the Koreyets. The crews did not surrender to the Japanese - the Varyag was and sunk by its own crew on February 9, 1904. The Korietz was blown up. A year later, the Japanese lifted it and put it back into service as their warship.  Russian Empire in the First World War  Russia purchased it back in 1916 and sent it for an overhaul to Britain, where it was arrested after the Bolshevik revolution of 1917. The British eventually sold the Varyag to Germany as scrap metal. In 1917, the cruiser was sent to England for an overhaul. In 1920, it ran into rocks while being towed to the junkyard and sank half a mile off South Scotland. In 1925, it was blown up to ensure the safety of navigation. The Varyag relics were displayed in a museum in Korea. Several years ago, the Incheon city authorities transferred the Varyag\\'s flag to Russia. The flag is now displayed at the Naval Museum in St Petersburg. A monument to the Russian cruiser Varyag was built on Incheon\\'s embankment in February 2004. It is made of garnet amphibole that is produced only in one place in Russia - Chupa on the Kola Peninsula. Laid in the base of the monument is a wooden cross that had been consecrated by Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow and All Russia. In 2011, the monument was moved several dozen metres to become the centrepiece of the embankment named after St. Petersburg.

He stood at the head of the OUN that is broadly believed to bear the brunt of responsibility for mass exterminations of ethnic Poles in the Volhynia region of what is northwestern Ukraine today in 1943 and 1944.

The so-called Ukrainian Institute of National Memory says 34 geographic objects that were among the 51,500 objects to undergo renaming as part of the nationwide \"decommunization\"?campaign bear Bandera\\'s name now.

The law condemns the Communist regime, prohibits the public display of Soviet emblems, opens the archives of Soviet-era security services, and proclaimed the OUN, the UPA and other such groupings to be fighters for independence. One of the provisions of the highly controversial law says the citizens of Ukraine and foreigners who demonstrate publicly disrespect for those who \"Fought for freedom and independence\"?will stand prosecution. Poroshenko has more than once cites the UPA as an instance of heroism and love for Ukraine, saying the posterity of its militants were defending Ukraine nowadays. He even went as far as posturing in a uniform with a \"\\x98Cynical Bandera\"?chevron. Simultaneously, the Ukrainian authorities prohibited the Soviet Banner of Victory and the notion of the Great Patriotic War, which denotes across the former USSR the battles on the Eastern Front of World War II from June 1941 through to May 1945. The latter bans look particularly weird on the background of data from the aforesaid Institute of National Memory suggesting that the number of Ukrainians, who fought on the side of the Red Army during the war, reached 6 million while the number of UPA militants was around 100,000.'],\n",

Russia has handed to the United Nations an appeal of the Crimean Tatar civil movement Kyrym, which requests to recognize the Black Sea peninsula\\'s accession to Russia as compliant with norms of international law, to condemn Crimea\\'s blockade and to help lift anti-Russian sanctions imposed by Western countries.   The appeal was attached to a letter sent to President of the 71st session of the UN General Assembly Peter Thomson by Russia\\'s Permanent Representative to the UN Vitaly Churkin. The letter was posted on the UN website on Wednesday. The appeal, approved by Kyrym movement in Simferopol on 10 December 2016, says that \" <...> violent coup d\\'etat in Ukraine,\" in 2014 \"which involved arson, the storming of administrative buildings and aggression against law enforcement forces resulting in numerous fatalities and considerable injuries, was a grave development that endangered the life, liberty and security of the people of Crimea.\" In the wake of those developments, Crimea\\'s authorities \"chose the only valid course of action: to create the independent sovereign State of the Republic of Crimea, to hold a referendum on 16 March 2014 and, based on the outcome thereof, to join Russia and, consequently, leave Ukraine. There is absolutely no doubt about the genuineness of the will expressed by the large majority of the population of Crimea in the referendum, which averted serious consequences for security, peace and stability in Europe.\" Crimean Tatars are convinced that \"international law does not establish any prohibitory rules on matters of secession,\" and reminded that this notion should not be replaced with the word annexation (forcible transition of one state\\'s land by another state). Kyrym called on the UN General Assembly to admit that the declaration of independence of the Republic of Crimea and its free association with the Russian Federation are not incompatible with the norms of international law,\" to condemn \"the policy of economic, trade and financial blockading of the Russian Federation, the Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol\" and to lift \"the political and economic sanctions\" imposed on them. The Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol, a city with a special status on the Crimean Peninsula, where most residents are Russians, refused to recognize the legitimacy of Kiev authorities brought to power amid riots during a coup in Ukraine in February 2014. Crimea and Sevastopol adopted declarations of independence on March 11, 2014. They held a referendum on March 16, 2014, in which 96.77% of Crimeans and 95.6% of Sevastopol voters chose to secede from Ukraine and join Russia.  Referendum in Crimea  On 27 March 2014, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a Ukraine-drafted resolution that branded the referendum as illegitimate and urged countries and international organizations not to recognize Crimea part of Russia. On 15 November 2016, the General Assembly voted for another Ukraine-drafted resolution, which condemned alleged human rights violations in Crimea. The four-page document condemned the infringement of human rights as well as the use of discriminatory measures against the inhabitants of Crimea, including Crimean Tatars, Ukrainians and representatives of other ethnic groups and religious confessions. Meanwhile, the Crimean Tatars\"?Kyrym movement said that-\"in all the years since independence was achieved in Ukraine, not one single piece of legislation was adopted to restore the political, economic, social and cultural rights of the Crimean Tatar people. This encouraged the authorities to commit arbitrary acts and violence against Crimean Tatar returnees and to disregard their rights to political, religious and socioeconomic development.\"'],\n",

Before the start of consultations the company submitted a comprehensive decommissioning program to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). According to the press release, the program recommends \"that the upper steel jacket on the Brent Alpha platform is removed, along with the topsides of the four Brent platforms, debris lying on the seabed, and the attic oil contained within the concrete storage cells of the gravity base structures.\" \"The program will also recommend that the three gravity base structures, Brent Alpha footings, the sediment contained within the concrete storage cells of the gravity base structures (Brent Bravo, Brent Charlie and Brent Delta), and the drill cuttings piles remain in place,\" the company said.

This is both Turkey and Russia\\'s success because if not for our countries, these talks would not have taken place,\" he stressed. \"Thanks to the Astana talks, the world has come to see that opposing sides can sit together at the negotiating table and talk,\" he added. Eker also said that \"the sides that are used to stare at each other through scopes came together in Astana.\"   \"The Astana talks marked the first step in settling the Syrian crisis. Close cooperation between Turkey and Russia resulted in a ceasefire established in Aleppo. The Geneva talks on Syria will take place later this month. We continue to work so that positive effect could be felt there as well,\" Eker added. When asked if the Astana talks could become an alternative to the Geneva negotiations, he noted that \"it will become clear later, when the sides make their assessments and begin to implement agreements.\" \"The matter is that real players, including Turkey, Russia, Iran, Syria and the United Nations gathered in Astana, while the Geneva platform is broader, other global players are participating in the Geneva process.

This is an issue that should be addressed together with Russia through diplomacy and efforts to find a solution that would be suitable for both countries,\" Eker said. He stated that Ankara\\'s attitude to regional cooperation with Moscow remained unchanged.   \"Cooperation between Turkey and Russia and joint efforts in the Middle East, in our region will make a contribution to the settlement of outstanding problems. At least our countries have achieved a fundamental agreement and held talks in Astana by bringing all parties together. Iran\\'s important role in that process is noteworthy,\" he said. About the situation in Syria Eker said it was an internal affair of the Syrian people and it was up to them to make a decision. \"This is precisely why both government representatives and the opposition gathered at the negotiating table in Astana. If a solution fails to be achieved, then international intervention may emerge on the agenda. The crisis may stop to be just an internal issue to grow into a regional and even world one to harm world stability, security, trade and the world economy respectively,\" Eker said. The humanitarian situation in Syria is \"very serious and millions of people suffer,\" he remarked. \"This problem must be resolved by diplomatic means. In this respect the joint stance taken by Turkey and Russia and the implementation of joint plans along these lines is of critical importance.

A situation regarding provisional suspensions of six Russian cross-country skiers, imposed last year over alleged violations of anti-doping rules, remains complicated, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said on Wednesday.   On December 23, the International Ski Federation (FIS) slapped provisional suspensions on six Russian cross-country skiers over alleged violations of anti-doping rules at the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi. The athletes subjected to the provisional suspensions are four male skiers, namely Alexander Legkov, Maxim Vylegzhanin, Yevgeny Belov and Alexey Petukhov and two female skiers - Julia Ivanova and Evgenia Shapovalova. The decision was made in the wake of the infamous McLaren Report. \"We are currently in a very complicated situation,\" Mutko, who oversees issues regarding sports, tourism and youth policies in the country, told journalists. \"There is still no general conclusion on the (McLaren) report and sports federations are making their own decisions,\" he said. \"However, we have a report and we have a special commission with the IOC (International Olympic Committee), which must carry out its own investigation and, most importantly, hear arguments on behalf of Russia.\" Russian cross country skier Maxim Vylegzhanin told TASS on Tuesday that he and his teammates Alexey Petukhov, Julia Ivanova and Evgenia Shapovalova were set to appeal their provisional suspension with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne. The FIS ruled on Tuesday to keep in force earlier imposed provisional suspensions in regard to the four athletes at the issue.   On January 25, the FIS Anti-Doping Panel ruled to keep in force the provisional suspensions of Legkov and Belov. Both athletes later filed appeals with the Swiss-based Court of Arbitration for Sport disputing the FIS ruling. According to Part Two of the report, delivered in early December in London by the WADA Independent Commission and its chairman, Canadian sports law professor Richard McLaren, more than 1,000 Russian athletes competing in summer, winter and Paralympic sports could have been involved in an alleged manipulation scheme to conceal positive doping tests. Part Two of McLaren\\'s report claimed in particular that doping samples of 12 Russian medalists of 2014 Winter Games in Sochi had been tampered with. In addition, doping tests of two more Russian athletes, who won four gold medals of the 2014 Sochi Olympics, had been falsified as well.'],\n",

       " ['Majority of Europeans favor Trump-style immigration ban A new survey by London think tank Chatham House reveals that the majority of Europeans are against further Muslim immigration. There is no country polled in which support for Muslim immigration surpasses opposition. In response to President Donald Trump\\'s executive order banning entry into the United States for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Shumer said: \"This order is against what we believe in America.\" Of all the executive action taken by Trump in his brief term thus far, this one caused the greatest uproar in the US and internationally. Trump banned the entry of citizens from the seven countries for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days and Syrians indefinitely. Judges expressed skepticism over the need for the travel ban, asking whether there was any evidence of a link between the seven countries and terrorism. The court said a decision would come \"as soon as possible.\" (08.02.2017) Around 10 thousand people have protested in the UK against a US travel ban that affects several Muslim-majority nations. Critics see the ban as inflaming religious tensions and violating international laws on refugees. (04.02.2017) Germany\\'s president has urged Europe to take a clear stance against Trump\\'s entry ban for citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. He said the order was \"incompatible\" with the European values of human dignity. (04.02.2017) The order led to mass protests and drew scorn from foreign leaders. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the ban \"contradicts the basic tenets of international aid to refugees and international cooperation.\" She added that it puts all Muslims under general suspicion. London Mayor Sadiq Khan expressed his opposition to Trump\\'s planned state visit in Great Britain, saying, \"I am quite clear, this ban is cruel, this ban is shameful, while this ban is in place we should not be rolling out the red carpet for President Trump.\" But Trump has been praised as much as he has been criticized. In the US, his followers are celebrating. His actions have also been applauded by right-wing populists in Europe like France\\'s Marine Le Pen, Geert Wilders in The Netherlands and Alexander Gauland from Germany\\'s Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. \"Trump is doing it right. He is showing us how to do it,\" Gauland said. Security or religion? Trump defended his order by saying that it was \"not about religion\" but instead, about \"terror and keeping our country safe.\" Is this true? Or is it actually about preventing the immigration of Muslims? A study conducted by the London-based think tank Chatham House concludes that Europeans want to curb Muslim immigration. Before Trump issued his executive order, Chatham House had asked 10,000 people from 10 European countries to evaluate the following statement: \"All further immigration from mainly Muslim countries should be stopped.\"- An overall average of 55 percent of respondents agreed with the statement. While Trump\\'s travel ban has drawn criticism, it also has significant support The survey was carried out in Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Great Britain, Hungary and Poland. Some countries, like France, Belgium and Great Britain, have relatively large Muslim minorities, while others, like Poland or Hungary, have practically none. This difference is not reflected in the opinion of Muslim immigrants. With the exception of Poland, the highest level of agreement to the statement was seen in countries that were at the center of the refugee crisis or were targets of Islamist terrorist attacks. It is also clear that in all of these countries, the right-wing populist parties are strong and in some cases, make up the government. The most pro-Muslim immigrant country was Spain, where 41 percent of the population opposed the survey statement. Refugee influx and terrorist attacks increase opposition Chatham House also analyzed socio-demographic data and came to some expected - but also some unexpected - conclusions. Many general claims are confirmed in the survey. Retirees are more likely to be against Muslim immigrants than people under the age of 30. In all 10 countries, 44 percent of survey participants between the ages of 18 and 29 were against an entry ban for Muslims, whereas 63 percent of respondents over 60 were for it. The level of education also played into the results. Of those who had completed secondary school, 59 percent wanted to stop further Muslim immigration compared to 48 percent of respondents who hold degrees. So actually, almost every second person with a higher level of education is for a Muslim entry ban. Support for a Trump-style ban is highest in European countries directly affected by the refugee crisis Gender and geographical location have almost no effect on the results. Of the men surveyed, 57 percent were for the entry ban compared to 52 percent of the women. Of those living in large cities, 52 percent were for a ban, while 55 percent of small town residents and 58 percent of the rural interviewees were for the ban. Number of Muslims clearly overestimated The results of the Chatham House survey are not unusual. A poll conducted in the summer of 2016 by the Washington-based Pew Research Center came to similar conclusions; however, there was a marked difference between individual countries. Respondents in five countries had a low opinion of Muslims - Hungary, 72 percent; Italy, 69 percent; Greece, 65 percent and Spain, 50 percent. The figures in Great Britain (28 percent) and Germany (29 percent) were much lower. The Pew survey also showed an overall average of 59 percent of those asked fear that the recent influx of refugees will lead to more terrorism. Surveys in the US revealed similar results. The fear of terrorism may lead to the fact that many Europeans overestimate the percentage of Muslims in their countries. Last autumn, Britain\\'s IpsosMORI Institute asked people in different European countries to estimate the percentage of Muslims in their countries. The French estimated four times more than the actual percentage and the British three times more.'],\n",

Their respective leaders agreed to work more closely henceforth to coordinate military action against the group. A Russian airstrike in Syria killed three Turkish soldiers and injured 11 others as they both fought the so-called \"Islamic State,\" Turkish officials announced on Thursday. The attack happened on Thursday morning near the northern Syrian town of al-Bab, which Turkish troops and Turkish-backed Syrian opposition fighters had been trying to capture from IS militants. \"During an operation by a Russian Federation warplane against Islamic State targets in the region of the Euphrates Shield operation in Syria, a bomb accidentally hit a building used by Turkish Army units,\" the Turkish military said in a-statement. Russian President Vladimir Putin phoned his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday to express his condolences, blaming the \"tragic incident\" on poor coordination between Moscow and Ankara, the Kremlin said. IS fighters in the town of al-Bab are almost surrounded by two different groups \"It was agreed to enhance military coordination in the course of the operation in Syria against Islamic State fighters and other extremist organizations,\" the statement added. Russia\\'s Defense Ministry said Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov also called his Turkish counterpart to offer condolences over the accidental-strike. \"Russian jets were carrying out a military mission to destroy IS positions in the area of Al-Bab,\" a Defense Ministry statement said. The two military chiefs \"agreed on closer coordination of joint actions and also the exchange of information about the situation on the ground,\" it said. The incident happened in the north of Syria where both sides are fighting against IS Troops clash outside IS town In the same area, Turkish-backed Syrian opposition fighters briefly clashed with Syrian government allied troops on the outskirts the IS-held town. It was the first such confrontation since the Turkey-backed offensive began in northern Syria last August. Heavily fortified IS forces in al-Bab were effectively encircled as Syrian government forces and their allies, aided by Russian airstrikes pushed from the south, while Turkish troops, backing Syrian opposition fighters, pushed their way from the western part of the town. The two countries back opposing sides of the six-year civil in Syria, but are both fighting against IS in various parts of the country. Russia and Turkey only recently repaired ties after Turkey shot down a Russian jet near the border with Syria two years ago. In late December, the two countries brokered a ceasefire for Syria and in January they sponsored-peace talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, attended by Syrian rebels and President Bashar Assad\\'s government officials. The Syrian ceasefire excluded areas where militant factions, IS and Syria\\'s al-Qaida affiliate, operate or hold ground. News of the deaths came as Turkey was holding funerals for five Turkish soldiers killed in an IS attack the day before. The Russian airstrike raised Turkey\\'s death toll in Syria to 64. aw/sms (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)'],\n",

Fillon\\'s lawyer has said the prosecutor is \"not competent\" to investigate the matter. Lawyers for French conservative presidential candidate Francois Fillon on Thursday urged financial prosecutors to drop their investigation into allegations his wife was paid for a supposed fake job. \"The financial prosecutor has no jurisdiction and its inquiry is, therefore, illegal,\" Fillon\\'s lawyer, Antonin Levy, told reporters, arguing that the candidate should be allowed to enjoy discretionary use of funds available to him as an elected lawmaker. The probe \"completely tramples democratic principles\" and deals a \"serious blow to the principle of the separation of powers,\" Levy said. Many expected Francois Fillon to be a shoo-in for the presidency. The former French prime minister easily won the conservative primary with 67 percent of the vote. But then Penelopegate hit. Weekly newspaper Canard Enchaine reported that Fillon\\'s wife Penelope and two of his children had received close to one million euros in salaries from Fillon, paid by the state. Fillon\\'s popularity tumbled. It is not illegal in France to hire family members as parliamentary assistants - provided they have real jobs. Fillon\\'s wife was paid 830,000 euros ($900,000) as a parliamentary assistant for 15 years, working (or - as some have suggested - \"working\") for Fillon and his replacement in parliament. Police are currently investigating whether Penelope provided services for the salary she received. Reporters also revealed that Fillon paid his two oldest children 84.000 euros for working as assistants between 2005 and 2007. Fillon argued that he had hired Marie and Charles Fillon for their legal expertise \"?though the two were still in law school when they had jobs with their father. Penelope was also employed at an art magazine from May 2012 to December 2013, where she was paid roughly 5,000 euros a month. The owner of the magazine had previously been recommended for France\\'s highest honor, the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor, by then-prime minister Francois Fillon. Fillon has said that these two facts were unrelated. Fillon has repeatedly denied charges that he used \"fake jobs\" to enrich his family. He has said that he employed his wife and children because he trusted them and accused the media of running a smear campaign against him. Nevertheless, Penelopegate has severely damaged the campaign of the 62-year old, who has sold himself to French voters as an honest family man keen on cutting public spending. The accusations against Fillon are hardly the first of their kind in France. Ex-President Jacques Chirac was found guilty in 2011 of employing party members in \"fake jobs\" as mayor of Paris. Former president Nicolas Sarkozy is being investigated for illegal campaign financing, and presidential candidate Marine Le Pen is suspected of paying officials in her far-right party with EU funds. Author: Mara Bierbach \\'Penelopegate\\' Initially considered a frontrunner for the French presidency, Fillon has been fighting to rescue his campaign, following accusations of embezzlement. His wife, Penelope Fillon, had received 830,000 euros ($900,000) in public money for her work as his parliamentary assistant over 15 years. However, last month, the satirical \"Canard Enchaine\" newspaper alleged his wife never carried out any work in the role. Fillon also employed his two oldest children , supposedly-for their legal expertise, although both were still in law school at the time. Those reports only fuelled allegations that he used such \"fake jobs\" to enrich his family. While having repeatedly denied the allegations, Fillon has seen his approval ratings plummet. Opinion polls show him trailing behind the Front National\\'s Marine Le Pen and independent centrist Emmanuel Macron, making it unlikely for him to-reach the presidential election run-off in May.- Fillon\\'s attorneys also criticized the media for publishing leaked details of the investigation, saying the reports will likely have an impact on the vote.-- \"The financial prosecutor\\'s office has a responsibility,\" Levy said.-\"It\\'s important that voters don\\'t have their election stolen in April.\"- Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/2WtZ4 dm/sms (AFP, AP)'],\n",

His likely successor, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, has been more restrained in criticizing Moscow It was his 101st - and last - state visit as German president, but during Thursday\\'s trip to Latvia, Joachim Gauck spoke as forcefully as ever about Germany\\'s unwavering-alliances. Meeting with the heads of state from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in Riga, Gauck admitted that the-choice of destination for his final visit as president was \"symbolic.\" \"It sends a conscious political signal that Germany stands at the side of our Baltic partners,\" Gauck said. \"The change in the security situation has illustrated the urgency of this,\" he added, referring to fears of Russia\\'s possible territorial ambitions in the Baltic region. Gauck-described Russia\\'s insurgency in eastern Ukraine as \"particularly worrisome\" and warned against a Kremlin-led \"disinformation campaign.\" The Baltic states were all once parts of the former Soviet Union but today find themselves aligned westwards as members of the EU and NATO. Since Russia\\'s annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, all three states have vocally decried the threat Moscow poses on their doorstep. Moscow has denied any military ambitions in the region, instead accusing-NATO of trying to encircle Russia. However, last year Moscow deployed nuclear-capable Iskander missiles in its heavily militarized enclave of Kaliningrad, which borders Lithuania and Poland. President Gauck stressed that Russia\\'s territorial ambitions threatened Germany\\'s Baltic allies. Beloved in the Baltics Thursday\\'s visit to the Latvian capital marked-the final state visit of Gauck\\'s-five years as German president. Gauck is reportedly held in very high regard in the -region, having often stressed Germany\\'s commitment-to its eastern NATO partners. On Thursday, he once again emphasized that pledge, saying: \"Germany stands alongside our Baltic partners and friends.\" Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite thanked Gauck for Germany\\'s military support and contributions towards strengthening NATO\\'s presence on the eastern flank.- Estonia\\'s Kersti Kaljulaid praised Gauck and German Chancellor Angela Merkel for taking on \"a leadership role within Europe.\" Times of uncertainty Gauck\\'s commitment to NATO and the Baltic states comes at-a testing time for the alliance. Baltic countries and other eastern European NATO allies, such as Poland, have expressed unease over comments made by US President Donald Trump, who called alliance \"obsolete\" during his presidential campaign. Under pressure from Western leaders, Trump has since toned down his words, saying that NATO is \"of fundamental importance\" to the transatlantic relationship. According to the German news agency dpa, Baltic leaders also voiced reservations over Gauck\\'s likely successor, Frank-Walter Steinmeier. In June, Germany\\'s then-foreign minister sharply criticized NATO military exercises in eastern Europe, calling such drills counterproductive to security in the region.

The Tanzanian government says it will-seek compensation for tens of thousands of people who allegedly were starved, tortured and killed by German soldiers-as they sought to-put down rebellious tribes between 1905 and 1907. The-German forces are-accused of crimes including forced starvation-following the tribal revolt known as Maji Maji. Germany ruled Tanzania, then known as Tanganyika, from the late 1880s-to 1919. In an interview with DW, Hussein Mwinyi, the Minister of Defense and National Service of Tanzania, said that the government is prepared to ask the German government to compensate those who were affected by the Maji Maji war.- DW: Why are you taking this action at this time? Hussein Mwinyi : In this case it was the result of a question that was asked in parliament by one of the members of the leadership who wanted to know whether the government is prepared to ask the German government to compensate those-affected by the Maji Maji war. So is this a consideration or have you-already reached a conclusion that you are going to take action? What I responded to that question is to say that, as Minister of Defense and National Service, we will write to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs-so that they can take the matter to the German government. -What exactly do you expect from the German side? Well, compensation is what we are looking for and there are a few other examples in the African region of-countries who have asked for this compensation. Kenya, for example, had asked for compensation from the UK government and Namibia, I have been told, is discussing the same with the German-government. So we are hoping to take-this forward to the German government ourselves. Should your compensation come through as you hope, how would this be utilized? To benefit the victims or is this something that's going to go to the national treasury for-the benefit of the whole country? No, the idea here is to compensate those who lost their lives and of-course there are some surviving victims of the war. But those who-lost their lives, they have people who could benefit from it. How soon do you think the process could start? I have already promised the House that I am going to write to the leaders of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and I am hoping they will pick up this issue as soon as possible.

       " ['The audacity of planning a general strike against President Trump Regardless of how it turns out, efforts to stage a general strike in the US are unprecedented in the modern era and show how deep the opposition against President Trump is. But the planned protest also raises questions. Can\\'t remember the last time a general strike shut down the United States? That\\'s because it has never happened. \"General strikes don\\'t happen in the United States,\" Kevin Boyle, a historian at Northwestern University who specializes in modern American social movements, told DW. What do happen are general strikes on a local level, but even those are exceedingly rare, explained Andrew Wender Cohen, a history professor at Syracuse University. \"The last major general strike was in Oakland, California in 1946,\" he said. Back then tens of thousands of workers walked off their jobs in a fight over unionization in the city. Extraordinary idea While regionally based general strikes like the one in Oakland - involving more than 10,000 workers and shutting down a local economy - happened earlier in the United States in places like San Francisco or Philadelphia, even those regional general strikes always were unusual.---- \"It is very, very uncommon in US history,\" Cohen told DW, adding that for some time now there have been only 20 to 30 strikes per year in the entire country.- Against that backdrop, calls for a general strike by the organizer\\'s of the Women\\'s March as well as by other groups are not just noteworthy, but daring. \"The idea of it is really quite extraordinary,\" said Boyle. \"It tells us something about the real depth of the opposition to the Trump administration that people are even talking about such a thing. I think it tells us something about really dramatic mass mobilization of the last couple of weeks in the United States.\" Upset and angry His colleague Cohen concurs that it is an indicator that people are \"really upset and angry.\" The big question though, argue the scholars, is whether the strike will be successful since Americans generally have far fewer labor protections than Europeans and the unionization rate is also far lower than in Europe, where general strikes are more common. \"It really is a question of whether the organizers can convince people to risk being fired or the wrath of their employer,\" said Cohen. \"I think this idea of a strike also carries with it a kind of class bias that I don\\'t think is a particularly useful thing,\" said Boyle.- \"It\\'s a heck of a lot easier for professional people to take an hour out of work than for working class people. That\\'s a tough thing to say for millions and millions of people. That\\'s not going to go down well at the local Wal-Mart.\" Risky move What\\'s more, he added, unless the turnout is truly extraordinary and has a great impact on the national economy, calling for a general strike runs the risk of falling short and having it labeled a failure, even if many people attend. A more apt vision of what may be achievable, said Boyle, would be the moratorium to end the Vietnam War on October 15, 1969, which was initially planned as general strike but then reconfigured as a moratorium. Instead of a general strike, huge protests were held across the US and globally to be followed by more protests one month later.- Francine Prose, a writer and former president of the PEN American Center, whose article in Britain\\'s \"Guardian\" newspaper has been widely credited with having spawned the idea of a general strike, is less concerned with organizing tactics or the possible perception of planned events.- The organizers of the Women\\'s March have called for general strike against Donald Trump Europe as a role model -\"I am not an organizer,\" she told DW. \"I just threw this idea out there.\" \"I spent a lot of time in Italy, so I have memories of waiting for the bus in downtown Rome and it would never come,\" said Prose, adding that she is of course aware that general strikes are far less common in the US than in Europe. And she also knows that it is far more risky and difficult for many Americans to participate in a strike than for Europeans.- The reason why she still called for a global strike, she said, was simply that while she feels that all protests against the Trump administration have been important, \"there is some part of me that thinks the only thing that these people care about is money and commerce. And perhaps the only way to really get to them is to shut it down for a day or to make things difficult, to make things uncomfortable.\" But that doesn\\'t mean, said Prose, that the success of a general strike should be measured only by its effects on the economy. Metric for success \"Let\\'s say every single American walked out of a job, didn\\'t buy anything, didn\\'t travel for a single day - I don\\'t think that would convince Donald Trump to step down,\" said Prose. More important than focusing on a single event or a single mode of opposition, she said, is to view every event broadly as a practice and preparation for the next move. Someone who can\\'t take to the streets to protest could perhaps make phone calls to a member of Congress.- Because the tangible results of the protests against the Trump administration\\'s plans can be hard to measure, Prose suggests a different metric. \"We can only imagine what would have happened if it wasn\\'t made clear that a significant percentage of the American people oppose these things.\"'],\n",

In morning trading at Wall Street in New York on Thursday, Twitter shares tumbled more than nine percent as investor hopes are fading for a rebound in growth at the messaging platform. Twitter reported a net loss in the fourth quarter of $167 million (156.3 million euros), after a $90-million shortfall in the same period a year ago. Revenue in the quarter rose a modest one percent to $717 million. Moreover, in the closely-watched area of user growth, Twitter ended 2016 with 319 million monthly active users, a gain of four percent from a year ago and only two million more than the prior quarter. Advertising revenue was down slightly from a year ago at $638 million, with revenue in the important US market falling five percent.

However, Twitter has never reported a profit so far, which is why it is eager to revamp its offerings and expand beyond its core base of politicians, celebrities and journalists. Some analysts had expected a rise in Twitter use following the election of Donald Trump, who is an avid user of the platform and frequently uses it to offer his views on policy. Outlook improving Twitter\\'s daily active usage grew for the third consecutive quarter, overcoming declining audience described by CEO Dorsey as \"the toughest challenge for any consumer service at scale.\" The company is now aiming to become profitable in 2017. \"We\\'re hearing positive feedback from our ad partners about our continued acceleration in audience growth and engagement,\" said chief operating officer Anthony Noto. Revenue growth would, however, continue to lag audience growth, he added, due to the sales cycle, and could be further impacted by the \"escalating competition for digital advertising spending.\" In a research note, Richard Greenfield of BTIG research firm said he saw positive signs of growing user engagement on Twitter because the service had been \"thrust into the global Zeitgeist\" after the US presidential election. \"Not only is President Trump actively using Twitter to communicate directly with the American people, his tweets are impacting consumers all around the world,\" he added.

The group conspired to destroy a gymnasium where refugees were to be housed in the town of Nauen near Berlin. A German nationalist was sentenced to eight years in prison on Thursday as the mastermind of an arson attack on a sports hall where refugees were set to be accommodated. No one was harmed by the blaze in the town of Nauen, but the crime did cause some 3.5 million euros ($3.7 million) worth of property damage. Maik S., a 29-year-old politician with the far-right National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD), was clearly motivated by hatred of foreigners, Judge Theodor Horstk?tter said. On top of his 8-year sentence, the man was handed an additional 18-month prison sentence for other racist crimes. Refugees were slated to live in the gymnasium until more permanent accommodation could be found \"The attack was meant to signal to refugees: you are not welcome here, we don\\'t have space for you, you aren\\'t safe here,\" said Horstk?tter. Maik S. consistently denied this through his trial, saying he wanted to char the building, not destroy it, and that he was not motivated by xenophobia. One of his co-defendants was also sentenced to six years in jail for the August 2015 crime. Four others were given lesser punishments for their involvement, suspended sentences of from eight months to two years. NPD survives two ban attempts According to Spiegel Online, prosecutors told the court that by forming a WhatsApp messenger group to plan the crime, the six men had formed a criminal organization. They also said the men were well known in Nauen, a town 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Berlin, for numerous anti-foreigner incidents. The group had reportedly set fire to the car of a Polish citizen, shouted xenophobic statements at town events, vandalized the office of a left-wing politician-and set off an explosive at a supermarket. Although Chancellor Angela Merkel has described the NPD as \"an anti-democratic, xenophobic, anti-Semitic, anti-constitutional party,\" two high-profile attempts to ban the party have been unsuccessful. A trial at Germany\\'s highest court in 2013 found that the organization had been infiltrated by too many law enforcement agents and that those agents would have to be pulled from the party if a move to ban it were to continue. Last month, a second trial found that the group was too small and insignificant to present a real threat to the state. es/sms (AFP, dpa)'],\n",

Sports associations are implementing protective measures, but more awareness is needed. Sexual violence in sport is a pressing issue. An abuse scandal in English football recently brought the topic to light but there are victims of similar cases in other countries, including Germany. According to \"safe Sport\"?a research project on children and teenagers in competitive sports, a large proportion of the 1,800 athletes interviewed for the study claim to be or have been a victim of abuse. The majority of them were under the age of 18 at the time of the incident. Along with physical abuse, the study also included victims who have suffered psychologically. This has included-being stared at, catcalling and or having to watch others have-sex. \"\\x9cOne third of all athletes who were interviewed-have at least experienced a form of sexual violence,\"?said Bettina Rulofs of the Institute for Sociology and Gender Research at the German Sports University in Cologne. \"\\x9cOne out of nine interviewees suffered severe or recurring sexual violence.\"?Rulofs and her team at the university conducted the study together with the Department of Child and Youth Psychiatry at the Ulm University Hospital. \"When we take into account the cases that include body contact, about five percent of female athletes and one percent of male athletes have suffered this type of abuse,\"?said project manager and child psychiatrist Marc Allroggen. The figures of abuse among young athletes are similar to those of the general population. Qualified personnel Regardless of any statistics, any case of sexual violence involving children or teenagers is one too many. Most victims continue to suffer decades after the incident. They have feelings of shame and embarrassment, many suffer from anxiety and eating disorders as a result of the psychological trauma they experienced. In some extreme cases, drug addiction is also a consequence. Physical contact between instructors and athletes is common but when is it too much? \"According to the data, sporting associations and teams are responsible of increasing protection for children and teenagers against sexual assault,\"?said Rulofs during a radio interview after the publication of her study. In some ways, this demand has been met by Deutsche Sportjugend (dsj), an organization responsible for competitive sports at youth level and also involved in the \"safe Sport\"?project. The organization has designated specific personnel who act as counselors for the prevention of sexual violence. About 80 percent of the top sports associations, including 20 sports associations organized by the German Olympic Sports Confederation (DOSB), have employed-counselors. The associations under the DOSB focus on promoting values, education, science and health in and through sport. As another preventative measure, coaches and exercise instructors in almost every state in Germany will be offered training to become a qualified counselor. Increased investments in prevention Johannes-Wilhelm R?rig However, according to dsj, there are about 90,000 sports clubs that still need to be acquainted with sexual violence prevention. According to a survey, only half of the participating associations stated that the topic was relevant to sports clubs and only a third of them have been proactive on the issue. Moreover, regular training on sexual violence prevention is only carried out in few clubs. Only one in ten sports club have a counselor to whom victims can turn to. \"We need to invest more in prevention, that is what I try to push for politically but the organizations have to do their part,\"?said Johannes-Wilhelm R?rig, the federal government\\'s head of the Independent Commission for Dealing with Sexual Abuse of Children. \"We need protection concepts and counselors in all sports clubs.

The fact the version of the song contained no vocals was no consolation. A vegan woman\\'s complaints about a famous nursery rhyme resulted in a German town removing the song from the-rotation in the town hall\\'s belfry, local media reported on Wednesday. The 19th-century children\\'s song \"Fox, You\\'ve Stolen the Goose\" included the offending lines: \"Fox, you\\'ve stolen the goose. Give it back! Give it back! Or the hunter will get you with his gun.\" The Limburg version of the song, however, was purely instrumental. An unnamed vegan woman who worked within earshot of the mechanical carillon complained to the mayor of Limburg. Town spokesman Johannes Laubach said the mayor, who was reportedly friendly with the woman, had temporarily granted her a reprieve. \"It\\'s time to go easy on the goose and exchange the pieces of music,\" said Marius Hahn, who managed the town hall. \"We have 15 pieces in our repertoire, most of them German folk songs.\" The \"Frankfurter Neue Presse\" newspaper-reported the woman was distressed by being reminded of the song\\'s lyrics - \"the hunter\\'s going to get you with his gun,\" rather than by the fox\\'s theft of the goose. \"Behind this is not an ideological motive, but it is a temporary grace period for a woman working in the immediate vicinity of the town hall and thus hears the chimes every day - and is annoyed about the song,\" \"Die Welt\" newspaper quoted Laubach as saying. The carillon - a series of bells - played tunes several times a day. A local newspaper posted a recording of the bells on YouTube featuring a photo of the mayor superimposed on a photo of the town hall. The German branch of animal rights group PETA released a statement saying some nursery rhymes unfairly targeted some animals and that foxes were an important link in the ecosystem. \"We understand the concerns of the resident and ask the mayor to remove the song from the program permanently. Old-fashioned songs like this, or even fairy tales such as \"Little Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf\" are, unfortunately, still widespread and send the wrong message to children, especially by throwing a bad light on specific animals,\" the group said in a statement. The new Brothers Grimm Museum in Kassel explores not only the work of the fairytale duo, but also art associated with their tales. Ukrainian artist Alexej Tchernyi studied in Kassel; his installation \"First Delivery\" is among the works on show in the museum, which opens on Sept. 4, 2015. It takes visitors back to the 19th-century world of the writers, who worked for a time as librarians in Kassel. Alexej Tchernyi is still working on his installation \"Jacob Grimm\\'s Dismissal from G?ttingen and Exile,\" referring to the Grimm brother\\'s flight from the central German city of G?ttingen. In November 1837, seven professors including the Brothers Grimm staged a protest planned changes to the Kingdom of Hanover\\'s constitution - and lost their jobs as a result. Kassel is not only known for its connection to fairytales, but also for hosting the contemporary art exhibition Documenta. Chinese artist Ai Weiwei exhibited at Documenta 12 in 2007. In 2010, he announced that he felt so inspired by the city, which had honored him with a civic award, that he wanted to create a work for the Grimm museum. The result: \"Colored Roots 2009-2015.\" Just a few weeks prior to the opening of the Brothers Grimm Museum in September, Ai Weiwei\\'s installation arrived in Kassel. The five boxes each weighed half a ton. The artist himself traveled to Germany on July 30 when Chinese authorities returned his passport after revoking it four years ago. Filmmaker Hannah Leonie Prinzler specializes in cross-medial documentary projects. She created the video installation \"Telling Rumpelstiltskin\" for the Brothers Grimm Museum. Ecke Bonk\\'s installation \"Buch der W?rter/ Book of Words: Random Reading\" was on show at the Documenta in 2002 and has been reinstated in Kassel\\'s newest museum. The \"German Dictionary\" written by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm included 318,000 entries - some of which are incorporated into Bonk\\'s work. This work, called \"Thorn Hedge,\" is a prickly affair made up of turf-covered poles and a corresponding sound installation that will undoubtedly draw in visitors of all ages. Small windows resembling arrow slits give visitors to the museum an altered view of the real world outside.

First introduced by President Ronald Reagan in 1984, the order prevents international organizations from receiving US aid funding if they offer women access to abortion-or counseling services and referrals to abortion providers.-The law had since been reversed by Democratic presidents and restored Republican ones. Swedish Deputy Prime Minister Isabella Lovin said the international community \"would not roll back several decades\" on abortion rights. \"Information about safe abortions has helped fewer girls become pregnant and allowed them to go to school and get an education,\" she said. \"We shall mobilize political and financial support and show there is a counter force to the troubling trend we see in the United States and other parts of the world.\" Lovin drew media attention last week after she released a photograph of herself surrounded by female colleagues signing a climate change law. It was considered by many as a thinly veiled criticism of the all-male audience Trump had when signing the order on to halt foreign abortion funding. Fixing-the funding gap One of the main goals of the conference is to restore funds to organizations which have been impacted by the US\\'s sudden withdrawal.

It is estimated that the funding gap created by the US is at least 600 million euros. A Swedish government spokeswoman said it was too soon to predict how much money the conference could raise. im/sms (AFP, AP, dpa)'],\n",
       " ['Hunting for fake news Fearing Russian influence and hacking, Dutch authorities plan to count election ballots by hand this year. Angela Merkel is being attacked in fake news spread by right-wing extremists. How can Europe protect itself? It was the largest movement of US troops in decades. On January 12, 2017, four years after the last American tank had been withdrawn from Europe, the US Army\\'s 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team was transferred to Poland. Over 3,000 soldiers, 87 tanks and hundreds of motor vehicles left the northern German port city of Bremerhaven to join local forces on the eastern Polish border. Photographers and camera teams were documenting the move and the public was allowed to watch as the political message to Moscow was intentional. Miraculous multiplication of tanks An obscure website in separatist eastern Ukraine reported a miraculous multiplication of tanks. The \"Donbass News agency\" wrote that the United States had transferred 3,600 tanks to the Russian border. The report claimed that the massive military march was directed against Russia. The separatist \\'Donbass News Agency\\' in eastern Ukraine turned 87 US tanks into 3,600 Ben Nimmo from the Atlantic Council is one of approximately 400 experts who help a small team of 11 people at the EU Foreign Service identify fake news. He uses the tank story to show how news stories are passed around from one website to the next and then politically instrumentalized. The Donbass News Agency did actually get the figure of 3,600 tanks from a real source. If you count all the vehicles, including the ones in reserve in the Netherlands, they add up to 3,600; however, the figure includes jeeps, trailers and Humvees. All the vehicles were suddenly seen as tanks. Defense analyst Ben Nimmo is a professional fake news hunter It was obvious that this false report was published intentionally. \"This is typical of fake news,\" said Nimmo. \"There is a kernel of truth in them and it is then embellished by a lot of rubbish.\" Journey through the web The tank story later appeared on a Canadian website known for spreading conspiracy theories. It reacted to the tank story with the headline: \"Political insanity.\" The story was blown up yet again, shared with other pro-Russian websites and then finally picked up by the Russia\\'s Ria Novosti news agency. Canada\\'s \\'Global Research\\' called the supposed 3,600 US tanks \\'political insanity\\' This is actually the key to the problem, explains Ben Nimmo. The news agency gives the fake article credibility. He pursued the story\\'s path further to the former Soviet Union, to Latvia, and the website of a Norwegian communist who later deleted it after it was obvious that the story was unfounded. \"That is exactly where the danger lies,\" Nimmo said. \"Fake news stories are as credible as their distributor and not the original source. And Ria Novosti obviously made the story look true.\" How do you fight fake news? In addition to the propaganda originating from Russian sources, countless fake news stories are going around because money can be earned from advertising on the websites that publish the false stories. In order to identify the fake news, one has to search for evidence and follow a story step by step from its source. \"Spreading fake news is a serious allegation. You have to prove it,\" said Nimmo. Several European governments, like those of France and Germany, have set up special task forces to deal with the problem. The \\'Center for Global Strategic Monitoring\\', a self-proclaimed think tank, gave weight to the story Nimmo says that anyone who knows their way around the Internet can search for fake news. \"You do not need to have a master of technology. You just need time and you need to be familiar with social media outlets and how they work together - everyone knows how to do that.\" However, experts are still needed to solve difficult and unusual cases, Nimmo said, but they must also teach interested citizens the art of uncovering fake news. If more people got involved, the detection rate would improve and then the political effect of fake news would wane. Nimmo had one more piece of advice to offer: \"The key is emotion. If a story appeals to your feelings, be they anger or rejection, and not your thoughts, then you have to check it.\" Europe\\'s enemies \"The dangerous thing is that the governments of several countries want to undermine the EU. Russia is the most important example but Turkey is also involved,\" said Marc Pierini from Carnegie Europe, adding now that the US government is publishing its own confusing reports, the situation will not improve. \"Russia employs a great deal of people and spends a lot of money to spread fake news; the EU and its members states cannot keep up,\" said Pierini. That is why everyone must help - the media and civil society - and be particularly cautious before elections, he added, because this modern form of propaganda has become a political instrument for several governments. Pierini does not see any danger in the present flow of fake news from Russia. \"What I fear is reports from the National Front in France, [Prime Minister Viktor] Orban in Hungary and others who are close to Russia or funded by Russia,\" he said. \"They tell people, for example, that they would be better off outside the EU and without the euro. And because the traditional left-wing or conservative parties have lost their value, there is a real danger.\"'],\n",

The woman had been told that she could not wear her headscarf while working because of an ideological neutrality law. Berlin may not deny candidates for teaching positions at public schools because they wear a Muslim headscarf, a court ruled on Thursday. The decision came after a woman was told she could not teach at an elementary school because her hijab violated the state of Berlin\\'s neutrality law. The defendant, who had worked in Berlin as an Islamic religious studies teacher for several years, had appealed a January 2015 decision in favor of the state government. Now, she has been awarded two months salary and part of her legal costs as restitution from the government. \"We are very satisfied and relieved,\" said her attorney, Maryam Hashemi. The court ruled that it was within the school\\'s purview to grant the defendant an exception to the neutrality law on the grounds of religious freedom. By simply dismissing her candidacy because of the hijab, the court said, the school had broken anti-discrimination statutes. Berlin would have had to prove that wearing a headscarf constituted a \"concrete threat to peace at the school,\" which it was unable to do. The state argued that it had tried to come to an agreement with the applicant, suggesting that she wear a wig instead because it was \"ideologically neutral.\" The defendant\\'s lawyer scoffed at the suggestion, saying that \"for religious reasons,\" wearing a wig was out of the question. Germany\\'s top court has already ruled twice that all-out bans on Muslim headscarves in the public sector are unconstitutional. Germany has eschewed decisions made by neighbors like France and the Netherlands in cracking down on the wearing of Islamic religious garb such as the burka. es/sms (AFP, dpa)'],\n",

The Bundesbank announced on Thursday that it had relocated some 216 tons of the precious metal to its headquarters in Frankfurt last year, including 111 tons from New York and 105 from Paris. That amount meant an increase over the 2015 total of 210 tons, while 2014 saw 120 tons moved and 2013 just 37 tons, Germany's central bank said in a statement. Until the collapse of the Soviet Union, Germany had kept most of its gold reserves of well over 3,000 tons outside the country for fear they might fall into the hands of the Soviets in the event of a war.

In 2013, the Bundesbank finally launched a relocation program to appease lawmakers and the public who-had demanded more transparency about how much gold it held and where. Originally, the plan called for the majority of the stock to be held in Germany by 2020, including all of the bank's remaining gold in Paris. Now it seems the Bundesbank will achieve this goal ahead of time because 47.9 percent of the total, or 1,619 tons, were repatriated already by December 2016. Bundesbank board member Carl-Ludwig Thiele said that-all of the 300 tons scheduled to be relocated from New York, for example, were brought back last year. Nevertheless, New York banks still hold 1,236 tons of German cold compared with 432 tons in London and 91 tons in Paris. Thiele said that the Bundesbank didn't plan-any further relocation beyond what had been planned.- uhe/sri (AFP, dpa) -\"],\n",

The EU had cut off aid to the country under former strongman leader Jammeh. The European Union pledged on Thursday to provide Gambia\\'s new democratically elected government-75 million euros ($80 million), two years after cutting aid due to human rights abuses by former President Yahya Jammeh. Adama Barrow (pictured), the new president, has vowed to reform-security services, respect human rights and improve the foreign relations of the tiny West African after defeating Jammeh in December elections. After ruling for nearly 23 years, Jammeh refused to step down and went into exile in January after coming under international pressure and West African troops entered the country. Jammeh has been accused of torture, killings and other human rights abuses, leading to poor relations with the EU and the expulsion of the bloc\\'s charge d\\'affaires in 2015. EU commissioner for international cooperation and development, Neven Mimica, said in the capital, Banjul, on Thursday that the aid package to one of the world\\'s poorest countries would be used to build the capacity of the state, increase food security and boost jobs. \"The visit is a clear signal of the EU\\'s readiness to provide immediate financial and technical support to the democratic process in The Gambia,\" Mimica told reporters. He added the EU was preparing a 150 million euro medium-term assistance package. A country of only 2 million people, Gambia\\'s weak economy and years of political repression have made it one of the leading source countries of migrants trying to reach Europe from Africa. Also on Thursday, Gambia committed to reversing its decision to withdraw from the International Criminal Court, Mimica said.- Separately, a group of West African nations announced they would extend for three months a troop presence in Gambia as Barrow attempts to clean up the army and intelligence services, parts of which became a personal tool for Jammeh to carry out repression. cw/sms (AFP, Reuters) -'],\n",
       " ['America first, Japan second Donald Trump\\'s upcoming meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is a test of whether or not the US president\\'s protectionist tone with close allies translates into action. Martin Fritz reports from Tokyo. Golf is known around the world as an icebreaker. At their first meeting at Trump Tower shortly after Trump\\'s election victory in November, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe brought a golf club as a gift. In return he received a golf polo shirt from Trump. On Friday, Abe will meet Trump again at the White House and on Saturday the two will play a round of golf together at Trump\\'s luxury golf course and \"Winter White House\"- Mar-a-lago in Palm Beach Florida. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the invitation to Trump\\'s private club is \"a testament to the importance the United States places on the bilateral relationship and the strength of our alliance and the deep economic ties between the United States and Japan.\" \\'Strength of the alliance\\' During his visit with Trump, Abe wants to ensure that Washington continues to support its close security partnership with Japan. US Secretary of Defense James Mattis said last week during a visit to Japan that the that US stood \"100 percent shoulder to shoulder\" with Japan, adding that Japan was an ideal example of sharing the costs of stationing US troops. Abe wants to ensure that Washington continues to support its close security partnership with Japan But Abe wants to hear for himself from Trump how US engagement in Asia is going to look in the future. For example, Japan has concerns that in the case of an economic agreement between China and the US, the-security issues may not be sufficiently taken into account. Growth and employment initiative Abe\\'s other goal is to mitigate Trump\\'s criticism of \"unfair\" trade between the US and Japan along with alleged \"devaluation\" of Japanese currency. \"I want to make clear that both sides have advantages with trade,\" said Abe to the Japanese parliament before his departure. Abe is also brining along a \"US-Japan Growth and Employment Initiative.\" The paper outlines a plan that would potentially create 700,000 new jobs in the US and invest $450 billion in new markets like infrastructure, robotics, artificial intelligence, developing the Internet and even space exploration. Other items on an unofficial wish list include high-speed trains along with super-efficient gas and compact nuclear power plants. Japanese companies are concerned According to a report in the \"Financial Times,\" the government in Tokyo has been requesting figures for development plans in the US. The number should be so high that Trump will want to post it on Twitter after meeting with Abe. Defense ties with the US are paramount for Japan But many companies are hesitant. For example, Toyota promised an investment of $10 billion (9.36 billion euros) over five years, which had already been planned. However, Toyota does not want to give up on exporting 1 million vehicles every year to the US. The Japanese auto parts supplier, Nisshinbo, also recently scrapped plans for a new production center in Mexico, even though, according to a spokesperson, the country is a preferred location for a North American factory. Trump\\'s statements on trade policy are said to be the reasoning behind the change of opinion. According to reports, Nisshinbo wants to invest 83.5 million for a new brake parts factory. Rescuing the TPP Japan\\'s government is still not giving up on trying to rescuing the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) in the medium term. A first step in this direction for Japan is proposing a new framework for discussing economic and monetary affairs. The framework would put US Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso in charge of setting rules for both sides regulating fair trade and investments while also discussing job creation in the US. Japan\\'s government is still not giving up on the TPP Japanese media is reporting that Abe will try and convince Trump about the benefits of this new framework. Additionally, Japan has promised that the rules would be nearly identical to the TPP and could be applied to the rest of Asia. However, Abe wants to avoid implying that a bilateral trade agreement with the US is just a TPP replacement. Abe invested a lot of political capital in the TPP, and in bilateral negotiations, Trump would demand changes that favor the US. \"Japan would have significant disadvantages in these negotiations,\" a Japanese government official told the Japanese newspaper \"Tokyo Shimbun.\" \"A bilateral agreement would be suicide for Abe or any other Japanese prime minister,\" Deborah Elms, executive director at the Asian Trade Center in Singapore, told DW. A possible solution for Abe would be to make proposals to Trump about how to reduce a trade deficit, for example by buying shale gas or military aircraft and weapons systems.'],\n",

German Chancellor Angela Merkel is seen in the caricature holding-a bloody knife in one hand and the separated head of the new leader of the Social Democrat Party (SPD) Martin Schulz in the other-on the cover of this week\\'s German edition of \"Charlie Hebdo.\" The tagline reads: \"Spiegel readers out of control\" (Spiegel-Leser ausser Rand und Band). The editor-in-chief of the weekly \"Der Spiegel\" news magazine this week defended his magazine\\'s front cover illustration of US President Donald Trump holding the severed head of the Statue of Liberty after widespread condemnation in the German and wider media. With most Germans seeing the US as nearly as big a threat as Russia since Trump took office, Der Spiegel\\'s front page illustration perhaps sums up the pulse of many in Germany, depicting the new US president carrying a knife in one hand and holding the decapitated head of the Statue of Liberty, the ultimate symbol of freedom, in the other. It was drawn by Cuban-born artist Edel Rodriguez. The New Yorker magazine has made no secret of its dislike of Trump\\'s election victory. The US weekly stays with the Statue of Liberty theme, illustrating just the arm of the Roman goddess of Libertas - who is carrying a torch that is said to light the way to freedom - only the torch has been extinguished. The illustration is entitled \"Liberty\\'s flameout\" by artist John W. Tomac. The Economist front cover underscores its coverage of Trump\\'s first days in office. The British weekly described how the real estate magnate had already \"lobbed the first Molotov cocktail of policies and executive orders against the capital\\'s brilliant-white porticos.\" It warned that the world \"should prepare for trouble\" now that there\\'s an insurgent in the White House. Opting for a photo of Trump\\'s chief strategist along with the headline \"The Great Manipulator,\" Time magazine asks whether Steve Bannon is the second most powerful man in America, pointing to his \"mind-meld with Trump.\" The US weekly said the two are both \"talkative and brash, pugnacious money magnets who never quite fit among the elite.\" French daily Liberation turned the stripes of the American flag into barbed wire to symbolize Trump\\'s protectionist rhetoric, including the plan to build a border wall with Mexico and his entry ban on citizens of seven countries.

       " ['A look at deportation policy in Germany Deportations of rejected asylum seekers have been a point of controversy in German politics over the past few months. Here\\'s a look at the deportation debate and statistics. In recent months, the German government has been speeding up deportation processes for those migrants who do not receive refugee protection.- The news agency AFP reported on Thursday-that around 80,000 migrants in total had left Germany in 2016, out of a total of 280,000 asylum seekers that arrived in the country last year. Of that number, 54,000 returned home voluntarily while the rest had been deported, either by charter plane or by other means of transportation over land or sea, according to a statement by German Interior Minister Thomas de Mazi¨¦re in January. Although there has been a drop in the number of asylum seekers since 2015 - when nearly 900,000 refugees entered Germany --the government has made a push for migrants to return home by choice. Recent programs, such as the \"Starthilfe Plus\" that started February, will pay a fee of up to 1200 Euros to migrants who return home voluntarily. Why is this a debate now? Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has unveiled-a new 16-point plan to speed up deportations ahead of-federal elections that will be held in September. Merkel hopes that the push for more deportations could rally her conservative base behind her against the populist Alternative for Germany (AFD) party, which has been critical of the chancellor\\'s-open-door policy towards asylum seekers, even calling for asylum seekers to be sent to islands outside of Europe. Concerns over security in Germany have further increased pressure on the chancellor. In December of last year, Tunisian migrant Anis Amri drove a truck into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12 and injuring 56 people. Amri had not been granted asylum, but he couldn\\'t be deported to due his home country of Tunisia not being certain of his nationality.- Germany has wanted to make it easier to deport those failed asylum seekers, especially those who could be a threat to national security. Other attacks in Europe, such as the-2015 Paris attacks and the-2016 attacks in Brussels and Nice, have made people more critical of who is let into the country as some of the perpetrators had received training in Syria from the \"Islamic State\" and had returned back to Europe. Critics of deportation On the left, the Social Democrats (SPD) and their candidate for chancellor,-Martin Schulz and his party have been critical of Merkel\\'s more hard-line deportation policy over the past few months.- In particular, the SPD has-contested the deportations of migrants to Afghanistan, which the party believes is not a safe country of return due to the unstable security situation there. Fighting between the Taliban and the Afghan government still continues in many parts of the country and-11,900 Afghan nationals in Germany were slated for deportation since mid-December. State governments controlled by the SPD, such as-Rhineland - Palatinate and Lower Saxony, have been holding up deportations, according to German news outlet, \"Der Spiegel.\"-- Deportation policy is ultimately up to governments of German federal states to decide, but the federal government is looking into new measures that will enable it to deny residence permits to asylum seekers and carry out deportations faster.'],\n",

       " ['Is 2017 the year human spaceflight returns? This could be a special year for human spaceflight. Europe and the US are collaborating and progressing with the Orion spacecraft, and next week, SpaceX inaugurates a revamped launch site in part for human cargo. To call it a space race at this stage would be odd, not to mention misleading. What we\\'re seeing now is more like a sprint, or a dash, where all the competitors are holding hands to the finish. First, both the Europeans and Americans are keen on human spaceflight. And they know they can\\'t do it alone - nations are pooling resources as much with each other as they are with commercial space enterprises. So much is clear. And as a result it will be a European Service Module that propels NASA\\'s Orion spacecraft beyond the moon and back in 2018. But there are further plans to build a second module for another mission, possibly in 2021, that will carry astronauts. If this happens, and no other mob trumps it, the mission will be the first to take humans beyond low orbit since 1972. The mission will be powered by European hardware. It will provide water, thermal control and atmosphere for a crew of up to four astronauts. Next week, the European Space Agency and Airbus Defence and Space sign off on an agreement with NASA, and they will get things started. The community, even in Europe, has embraced a public-private approach to space. \"Involving the commercial sector and their new fresh ideas, of course it\\'s a good idea,\" says David Parker, ESA\\'s head of Human Spaceflight and Robotic Exploration. \"There are fantastic entrepreneurs out there who may provide a telecommunications service around the moon so that everybody can have the telecommunications for their lunar lander or their astronauts.\" Modern launch pad Then there\\'s SpaceX, one of the commercial providers that has been delivering supplies to the International Space Station. It plans to inaugurate a revamped, fourth launch facility - a modified NASA launch complex in Florida known as \"39A\" - also next week. ESA\\'s David Parker used to head the UK Space Agency. The UK has long focused on the commercial benefits of space NASA\\'s Space Shuttles launched from 39A (before they were grounded). They were the last of America\\'s human space capability. Activating 39A may well help SpaceX clear a current backlog of about 70 flights. It\\'s also another step in NASA\\'s plans to have SpaceX and Airbus competitor, Boeing, ferry astronauts to the International Space Station-by the end of 2017. The SpaceX rocket, Falcon 9, which carries a Dragon capsule, launches from 39A. Boeing has its CST-100 spacecraft. All this commercial enterprise will, however, come at a cost. \"Of course it will be a commercial service, but bringing that kind of entrepreneurial spirit, I don\\'t think it\\'s a bad thing,\" says Parker. For science and riches Historically, says Parker, people have explored for various reasons. During the gold rushes of the Wild West and Australia, for instance, some will have gone for the riches and others for the pure exploration, the science. But space is such an untapped resource, there\\'s so much we don\\'t know,-what it is, how it \"functions,\" or how much it\\'s worth. So are we really prepared to let this rejuvenated age of entrepreneurial space exploration develop on a \"wait-and-see\" basis? Just look at the internet if you\\'re wondering where that kind of attitude may lead us. That said, skeptics like me may have to endure a few entrepreneurs earning bucket loads in the short-term, and hang on for the long-term benefits for the rest of humanity. Economics Minister Brigitte Zypries shares a mobile moment with astronaut Matthias Maurer and ESA chief Jan W?rner \"When we understand the other 90 percent of the physics, imagine what relevance that might have to everyday life,\" says Parker. \"Just as you rely on a mobile telephone today, you don\\'t think about electromagnetic wave theory, do you? But fundamental physics is built into your phone.\" Equal opportunities? So finally what about our investment in people as we take this next step? We talk about \"manned\" missions to the moon. But does that include women? Germany\\'s Economics Minister Brigitte Zypries, whose department is responsible for space activity, certainly hopes so. \"A lot of women are interested,\" says Zypries. \"About 900 women applied through the initiative, \"Die Astronautin [The astronauts].\" They\\'re working with ESA and we\\'ll find out soon who\\'s among the final 10 candidates. So, first, let\\'s select one or two of them. But we also have to make sure women continue to be interested in technical professions, and we can only encourage them by saying, \\'Get stuck in, you can do it.\\'\" David Parker can do little but agree. And he sees the number of opportunities for people getting to space, wherever or whatever they are, as commercial and public human spaceflight takes off.-- \"With the Americans building not one, not two, but three new space vehicles that will take astronauts into space, up to the space station, and also beyond as we look to heading back to the moon and onto Mars, the opportunities are going to increase,\" says Parker. \"And there will be different ways for people to get up into space, maybe even commercially. The more people that experience going to space the better.\"'],\n",

Doctor Thomas B?rner is a devout Christian and a gynaecologist with 26 years experience. Since 2010, he has worked at-the Capio Elbe-Jeetzel Clinic in the northern German town of Dannenberg, where 31 abortions were conducted in 2016 alone. None of them were conducted by B?rner himself. And when he was promoted to head physician in December 2016, he decreed that abortions would no longer be performed in the hospital, citing his personal religious belief that life is to be protected under all circumstances.  Many western countries have Right to Life and Right to Abortion movements and their various annual rallies - some bigger, some smaller. Here\\'s what it\\'s like in Germany. (18.09.2015) The number of German women terminating a pregnancy has been falling over the last 10 years. The figures come days before the morning after pill becomes available over the counter without prescription. (10.03.2015) German women seeking abortions at a late stage of pregnancy will be required to undergo a consideration period of at least three days before a physician can make a final decision, the parliament has decided. (14.05.2009) Such a single-handed decision by an individual doctor is a first in Germany. The hospital in question is run by the Capio group, one of the major providers of healthcare across Europe. B?rner\\'s bosses backed him initially, arguing that women could turn to other hospitals in the region. But the case triggered a heated debate across the country. The legal situation In Germany, any woman above the age of 18 can have an abortion in the first 12 weeks after conception. However, she must be able to show documentation that she underwent compulsory counseling in a state-approved center at least three days prior to the operation. Rape victims are an exception. They do not need to undergo such counseling and-can terminate a pregnancy by providing a doctor\\'s certificate. In such cases, medical fees are covered by the patient\\'s health insurance.-In all other cases, the women need to pay themselves. If the woman is under the age of 18, she needs the consent of a parent or guardian to proceed. Abortions carried out-12 weeks after conception are illegal and punishable by up to three years in prison. An abortion can be conducted through an abortion pill in the very early stages of pregnancy, or as surgical procedure. Not every hospital is obliged to perform abortions, but health authorities must ensure every woman can easily reach a hospital or clinic that does provide abortions. A matter of precedence The situation of the Dannenberg clinic is special, however, as it is the only hospital in the region with-a gynaecological department. The owners of the Capio Elbe-Jeetzel clinic are in discussion with staff about abortion procedures No German doctor \"?or other medical staff - can be forced to conduct or assist with abortions. They can refuse this without giving any reason. Church-run hospitals in Germany do not perform abortions. Medical emergencies, however, are a different matter.-No doctor may deny a woman an abortion if her life were otherwise at risk. Also Germany\\'s highest administrative court has ruled-that willingness to allow legal abortions is a prerequisite for the appointment of any chief physician. Resurgence of an old debate The Dannenberg case is unique because a single doctor decided to refuse abortions based on his personal beliefs in a hospital which is not a church-run institution. \\'My body, my decision\\' reads the placard of anti-abortion campaigner Germany\\'s current legislation was introduced in 1992. Before that there had been a long debate between those who wanted abortions to remain illegal, in accordance with paragraph 218 of the country\\'s criminal code. The pro-life camp sees it as ethically indispensible to unconditionally protect every form of life from the day of its conception. The pro-choice side believes in women\\'s self-determination. It is an argument that is being played out around the globe. Conservative politicians in Germany were quick to praise Doctor B?rner for his \"brave move.\" In Dannenberg, meanwhile, management changed its tune, stressing the clinic\\'s commitment to providing health care in accordance with Germany\\'s laws and regulations. \"We accept personal decisions, but departmental organization is a matter for the public authorities,\" CEO Martin Reitz told the news agency epd.- Doctor B?rner has vowed to stick to his ethical principles and has promised to bear the consequences this may have for his professional future.

       " ['French chef Alleno earns sixth Michelin star as haute cuisine gets \\'uncomplicated\\' France now boasts 27 three-star restaurants and, between his two restaurants, culinary wizard Yannick Alleno has six stars to his name. According to the Michelin Guide, haute cuisine is going \"ecological and economical.\" The latest additions to France\\'s prestigious Michelin Guide were revealed Thursday in Paris. Only one restaurant was added to the three-star list: Le 1947 in the exclusive ski resort of Courchevel. Head chef Yannick Alleno reacted to the award by-tweeting-that he was \"beyond happiness,\" and congratulated his teams both at Le 1947 and at his Paris restaurant Le Pavillon Ledoyen, which already holds three Michelin stars. Michael Ellis, the American-French head of the Michelin Guide, called the cuisine at Le 1947 \"extremely technical, creative and tasty.\" Menus there range from 127 to 450 euros ($135-480), not including wine, and feature dishes such as steamed scallops with celery extract and caviar. While Alleno\\'s house was the only restaurant in France to receive a third star this year, 12 were added to the two-star list and 57 to the one-star list. In total, France now has 27 one-star restaurants, 86 with two stars and 503 one-star locations. The Paris hotel Le George V was already home to a three-star restaurant, but won stars for two others within its house, making it the first hotel in Europe to boast three Michelin-starred restaurants. While dining at Le 1947 or one of the Le George V locations may be out of reach for most customers, Ellis pointed out that there are several eateries in the 2017 Michelin Guide that won\\'t break the bank. Lunch is available for 25 euros at the one-star Auberge Tiegezh in Guer, while Paris\\' one-star Restaurant H offers 30-euro lunches and 50-euro dinners. \"There has been a trend among chefs to favor uncomplicated dishes with often simple ingredients, local and in season, with short menus that change frequently,\" noted Ellis.-\"It\\'s both ecological and economical.\" Tire maker Michelin started publishing its restaurant guides over a century ago in a bid-to encourage travel by car - and thus more tire sales. The guides have since established a market of their own and are available not only in France but in 28 countries worldwide. kbm/eg (AFP, dpa) -'],\n",
       " [\"How will Bayern Munich replace Philipp Lahm? Philipp Lahm's retirement will leave a big hole for Bayern Munich, and not just in terms of leadership. DW goes through the possible replacements for Bayern's retiring captain at right back. How do you replace one of Bayern's best ever players? Some would say the task is impossible, but it is a question the Bundesliga champions-will have to answer when-Philipp Lahm retires at the end of-the season. Bayern have plenty of players qualified to take the captaincy in Lahm's stead, but a replacement at right back may be a little harder to find. Here are a few of the players Bayern might turn to. In-house options Rafinha initially seems the obvious-choice to replace Lahm, purely as a result of his place in the Bayern pecking order. The Brazilian-is no stranger to filling Lahm's shoes and-he did just that in-the 2013-14 season, when Pep Guardiola moved Lahm to center midfield. Rafinha is just two years younger than Lahm and only under contract until-the end of the next-season, but he would be a solid interim option as Bayern seek a long-term replacement. Joshua Kimmich replaced Philipp Lahm at right back in Euro 2016 That could be-Joshua Kimmich, the player who replaced Lahm in the German backline after his retirement in 2014. Kimmich was a revelation for Germany coach Joachim L?w at the last European Championship in France, but Ancelotti has played him more in midfield this season. Whether his future lies in midfield in defense is still unclear, and whether his ability in the middle of the park casts-doubts over whether-Kimmich is the best-replacement for Lahm in the long run. Another versatile defensive reinforcement for Bayern will arrive after the season. Sebastian Rudy, who signed a four-year contract with the club in January, has also played on the right side of defense both for club and for country. But his performances at full back did not impress L?w enough to include him in Germany's squad for Euro 2016, so-it seems unlikely that Ancelotti will commit to the Hoffenheim man-as a first choice defender. Recruiting a replacement German sports magazine Sport Bild-reported that Bayern see-Bayer Leverkusen defender Benjamin Henrichs as a possible heir to the-33-year-old. The 19-year-old came through the ranks at Leverkusen as an attacking midfielder but has played almost exclusively in defense in his first full season as a professional. He also won his first cap for the German national team in their World Cup qualifier against San Marino in November. Henrichs-has a contract with Leverkusen until June, 2020, so Bayern would have to pony up some serious-cash to pry him away from the Werkself. Benjamin Henrichs (left) has impressed for Leverkusen this season Bayern has also reportedly shown-interest in Hoffenheim defender Jeremy Toljan in the past. The 22-year-old started every one of Germany's games at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, and was becoming a regular at Hoffenheim before suffering an injury during the Bundesliga's midseason break. Toljan, who like Lahm can play either side of the defense,-is only under contract until the end of the 2017-18 season,- which might make his recruitment a little less expensive. -\"],\n",

Although deportations are a state matter, the federal government made it clear it wants to play a bigger role. Deportations of rejected asylum seekers have been a point of controversy in German politics over the past few months. Here\\'s a look at the deportation debate and statistics. (09.02.2017) German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere has said the federal government should be allowed to deport asylum seekers who pose a security risk. Detention centers are part of plans to expand Berlin\\'s security powers. (03.01.2017) A program to pay asylum applicants in Germany to return to their home countries, often before a decision is made on their status, has begun. The government wants to increase the number of people who choose to leave. (01.02.2017) Fingerprints are making headlines in Germany. At the height of the refugee crisis, newcomers entered without immigration controls. One result: benefit fraud. It must be stopped, says Joachim Stamp from the FDP. (08.02.2017) The German government has presented its new plans for keeping the country safe from terrorism. They involve ankle tags and extended pre-deportation incarceration - but critics wonder if it will make a difference. (10.01.2017) The German government has revealed how many young refugees were denied asylum following a parliamentary inquiry launched by the Greens. The government has said the minors failed to meet asylum requirements. (08.02.2017) German Chancellor Angela Merkel-met with the premiers of Germany\\'s 16 states in Berlin on Thursday to discuss a plan that will-speed up the deportation process for migrants denied asylum. One of the main tenets of the 16-point plan concerns a central coordination center in Berlin that would include representatives from each state. Additionally, the plan calls for federal deportation centers to be set up-near airports to facilitate collective deportations. \"We have agreed that a repatriation center, where all responsible authorities are present - which to some extent already exists - should be constructed under federal authority in Potsdam,\" said Volker Bouffier, the state premier of Hesse. The proposed plan would also make it easier to deport migrants who have been deemed as threats and increase incentives for \"voluntary returns,\" where migrants receive money if they choose to leave Germany before receiving a final ruling on their asylum application. Within its federal system, Germany\\'s individual states are responsible for carrying out deportations, but the federal government wants to be granted more powers to deny residence permits and carry out deportations itself. Increasing federal powers German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere, who outlined the plan last month, said on Thursday that Germany needed-a \"joint effort\" to deport people more expeditiously. \"The number of rejections is increasing, therefore, we need to do more for repatriations and deportations,\" de Maiziere said on German public broadcaster ARD\\'s Moregenmagazin program. He also held firm on his position to continue deportations to Afghanistan, which have been criticized by some state governments. Germany\\'s opposition Green Party criticized the government\\'s plan to establish central departure centers on Thursday. \"This is the wrong approach,\" Green Party co-chair Simone Peter told German public broadcaster SWR.-She argued that the federal government wanted-to take on responsibilities that could be more effectively organized at the state level. She also said Berlin was supposed to present proposals for increasing security measures in Germany, rather than focusing on deportations. \"This goes beyond the original goal,\" Peters said. Merkel has been facing pressure to overhaul Germany\\'s security structure ahead of the national election in September and in light of a truck attack on a Berlin Christmas market in December. The main suspect in the attack was rejected asylum-seeker Anis Amri who couldn\\'t be deported as Tunisia did not initially recognize him as a citizen. rs/msh-(AP,-AFP, dpa) Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/2W882'],\n",

The port city wants to deepen the Elbe by about a meter to ease access for mega freighters. A German court on Thursday gave Hamburg a provisional green light to deepen the Elbe River to open up the port city to mega freighters, but ruled that planners first had to address a number of flaws in the project. Hamburg, with the support of federal government,-wants to deepen-the Elbe between the inland port and-Cuxhaven where the river flows into the North Sea. A historic trading city known as \"the gateway to the world,\" Hamburg argued the project is necessary to open Germany\\'s largest port to mega freighters and maintain international competitiveness. The environmental organizations BUND (Friends of the Earth Germany)-and NABU (Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union) filed a court challenge against the dredging. They argued the project would negatively impact water and species conservation efforts. One issue the court noted in its ruling was the endangered plant species called the \"Schierlingswasserfenchel\" (Oenanthe coniodes or water hemlock),-which in Europe only grows at the mouth of the Elbe. The court said that the adverse effects on this plant caused by salt water might have been underestimated. The \"Schierlingswasserfenchel,\" or water hemlock, is only found in Europe around the mouth of the Elbe. The court that the existing plan as submitted was-\"illegal and can\\'t be carried out because of violations of the habitat protection law,\" albeit stressing that \"these shortcomings can be fixed and therefore do not lead to the revoking of the planning permission.\" Hamburg can move forward with deepening once it addresses flaws in its plan and addresses risks to the endangered plant, the court ruled.- Other complaints from the environmental groups were thrown out by the court. cw/msh-(AFP, dpa) -'],\n",

KiK and the victims\\' families still disagree over responsibility of the catastrophe. A fire in a Karachi factory, which produced clothes for the German company KiK, killed over 260 people in 2012. The victims\\' families are in Germany to pursue their case against KiK in a Dortmund court. DW spoke to them. (23.06.2016) Thousands of garment workers have staged a protest in the Bangladeshi capital on the third anniversary of the Rana Plaza disaster. Hundreds died when the flimsy factory complex collapsed, but no one has been convicted. (24.04.2016) At least 19 people have died in a factory collapse in the eastern city of Lahore, while rescuers pulled over one hundred people from the rubble. Poor construction and maintenance caused similar accidents in the past. (05.11.2015) Nasir Mansoor, general secretary of the National Trade Union Federation in Pakistan, confirmed Wednesday that KiK (Kunde ist K?nig, which in English translates into \"Customer is King\") has released $5.15 million (4.82 million euros) for the families of the Karachi-based Baldia Town factory fire-victims. Mansoor told Pakistan\\'s \"Dawn\" newspaper that the amount has been transferred to an International Labor Union (ILO) account in Geneva. \"ILO Country Director in Pakistan, Ingrid Christensen, will hold consultations with affected families on Thursday, February 9, with representatives of non-governmental organizations in attendance,\" Mansoor told Pakistani media. Over 260 people died on September 11, 2012, when a textile factory in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi caught fire. The blaze was able to spread quickly partly because the safety standards were blatantly violated by the factory owners, and the emergency exits were blocked or even locked. The incident was dubbed as Pakistan\\'s \"industrial 9/11.\" The transfer of funds was the-result of an agreement between KiK and the Pakistan Institute of Labor Education and Research (Piler). \"Initially, the company had denied to pay any sort of compensation but later it agreed to pay an amount when the stake holders, with the help of NGOs, took up the matter in Germany through media campaigns,\" said Mansoor, who, along with some victims\\' relatives, visited the German city of Dortmund in September last year. \"The German government also played its role in the agreement on the payment of amount to the affected families,\" Mansoor added. KiK\\'s latest move to compensate the families of the factory victims is not linked to the court case in Dortmund. The Regional Court of Dortmund issued an initial decision in September last year, accepting jurisdiction over the case and granting legal aid to the claimants to cover the lawsuit cost. KiK says it is not responsible for the factory fire as it was an arson attack Workplace safety \"My 18-year-old son died because of-capitalist greed. He was my only son, the only breadwinner, who lost his life in the Baldia Town factory fire,\" Saeeda Khatoon, a 49-year-old Pakistani woman from Karachi, told DW. \"My son was earning only around 10,000 rupees (84 euros) per month and that too after working sometimes 72 hours at a stretch,\" Khatoon said. On March 13, 2015, Khatoon and three other people affected by the fire filed a case against KiK at a regional court in Dortmund. Like Khatoon, Muhammad Jabir, 62, and Abdul Aziz Khan, also 62, lost their sons to the fire, while Muhammad Hanif, 26, is a survivor himself. They are seeking compensation and an apology from KiK. The German retailer says it is not responsible for the blaze, arguing that owners of the factory didn\\'t follow the security precautions. In June 2016, Khatoon and Khan came to Germany for consultations with civil society organizations and legislators. They were supported by the National Trade Union Federation\\'s Mansoor and a number of international rights groups, including the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), Clean Clothes Campaign, and Medico International. Saeeda Khatoon and Abdul Aziz Khan demand \\'justice\\' Initially, KiK established an emergency fund to support the families of the victims with a total of $500,000 (439,000 euros), and was even considering doubling the amount. But it backed out from its promise after a Pakistani investigation claimed the fire was an arson attack carried out by a local political party. But rights groups say the case was never about who caused the fire. \"The multi-national companies should be held responsible for what is happening down the chain. They must ensure the working conditions at their manufacturers are up to the standards approved by the ILO,\" Mansoor told DW. Farooq Tariq of the Awami Workers Party told DW from the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore that most factory owners in Pakistan do not follow labor laws. \"According to our survey, there are more than 300 factories operating in the residential areas of Lahore, yet none of them obey labor laws and conventions,\" Tariq claimed. \"They do not allow labor inspection in their factories, which, in my opinion, is essential to safeguarding the safety and rights of the workers. Sadly, the government protects the factory owners.\" Profiteering Karachi-based trade union activist, Sartaj Khan, believes the responsibility of industrial disasters like the Baldia Town factory fire in Karachi and the Rana Plaza blaze in Bangladesh\\'s capital Dhaka lies with the capitalist system. More than 1,135 factory workers died when the Rana Plaza complex came crashing down on April 24, 2013 in Bangladesh \"Countries like Bangladesh and Pakistan face tough competition from other markets that provide cheap labor to international companies. They compromise on safety measures to reduce their services cost. It works well for international retailers as they are there to make a profit,\" Khan told DW. \"But at the end of the day, it is the responsibility of the local governments to make sure that the labor laws are properly implemented in these factories.\" Khan said the issue should be seen in relation to the global financial crisis. \"Local and international companies are not making as much profit as they did in the past; therefore we see an increase in the exploitation of workers. Now, the workers have to work for longer hours for less money,\" Khan said, adding that such incidents would continue to happen if the workers didn\\'t unite against the factory owners and pressure their governments to ensure better pay and security at work. Abdul Aziz Khan, who also lost his son in the Baldia Town factory fire, appealed to the German public to support their cause and put pressure on the companies and the government. \"We are thankful to the German people for their support. But we also expect them to demand from their companies that they ensure workplace safety in the factories that manufacture products for them,\" Khan said. Saeeda Khatoon says the incidents like the Baldia Town factory fire shouldn\\'t happen anywhere. \"No mother should suffer the way I have.\" Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/1InZF'],\n",

They were both born in Germany and lived with their parents.- The raids yielded weapons-and ammunition as well as \"Islamic State\" flags, investigators said. - Police displayed at a press conference the weapons, ammunition and IS flags found in the raids. Boris Pistorius, the state of Lower Saxony\\'s interior minister, called the operation a \"very important blow against the [radical Islamist] scene.\" He said the two men had \"very concrete\" attack plans, but at the moment it is unclear if the suspects had determined an exact time for an attack. The raids come as German authorities have conducted a string of operations targeting suspected terror plotters. The terror threat has prompted the German government to pass a raft of security measures in recent months as security questions and immigration take a prominent role in upcoming national elections in September.- Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/2X4DB cw/msh-(AFP, dpa)'],\n",
       " ['Australian consumers given a rough deal by VW? Australian consumers are unhappy about the way German carmaker VW has been treating them after the company\\'s emissions-cheating scandal broke in 2015. VW car owners are waiting for \"proper compensation.\" Australian consumer rights group Choice said Thursday Volkswagen must come clean and give VW car owners in the country the truth about its emissions scandal. The group accused the German auto giant of not giving buyers proper compensation or the option to receive a refund (as is the case in the US). \"Currently, Australian consumers have been offered only a technical update,\" a Choice spokesman said, adding that it was \"a global scandal, and all affected customers should be given access to similar remedies.\" \"Clearly, VW is reluctant to cough up for its failings down under and although running a recall in Australia, the company continues to restrict consumers\\' refund rights and serve up a smokescreen of weasel words,\" Choice CEO Alan Kirkland noted. VW for its part claimed Australians were not qualified for any compensation scheme like the one in place for US clients. \"As Choice should be aware, US emission regulations are unique in the world in that they are based on nitrous oxide emissions,\" Volkswagen said in a statement. \"Australia\\'s regulations, like those of the more than 70 countries that subscribe to the EU emissions regime, are based on lowering fuel consumption and carbon monoxide.\" Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/2W5Xz Probe continues Right now in Germany, investigators keep trying to solve the puzzle of who knew what and when about the emissions-cheating scam. The probe that\\'s also directed against former VW CEO Martin Winterkorn had entered a new round after former VW boss Ferdinand Piech suggested Winterkorn and other executives had known about the pollution scam well before the scandal broke in September 2015. Winterkorn, who headed up the Wolfsburg-based firm from 2007 to 2015, had always insisted he knew nothing about any defeat devices in some 11 million VW cars worldwide before it became public knowledge. At the end of January, prosecutors announced, though, they were investigating Winterkorn for fraud, saying they had \"sufficient indications\" the manager learned about the cheating earlier than he claimed. hg/jd (dpa, AFP) -'],\n",
       " ['People smuggler \\'wanted to help\\' Filipinos By the time Iluminada Panabe was convicted of human smuggling, police estimated 800 Filipinos had gained illegal entry to Europe. Ana P. Santos spoke with Panabe, who has been serving her sentence in northern Denmark. As with many police busts, it all started with a suspicion and a snitch. The increasing number of Filipinos coming to Denmark from the Philippines was the first thing to trip the alarm. \"The Danish alien service saw and reported some suspicious activities regarding Filipinos living in Denmark often having family members visit from the homeland. These visits were always from a new family member,\" Danish police inspector Michael Kjeldgaard told DW. Then came an anonymous tip that a Filipino woman, Iluminada Panabe, was smuggling people from the Philippines to Europe using Denmark as a gateway. German authorities arrested considerably fewer human traffickers in 2016 compared to the previous year. More than 50 percent of arrests were made on the Austrian-German border. (08.01.2017) The Philippine workers are desperate to leave the country, willing to pay a high price to wager a chance at a better life abroad. But it is not easy to achieve, and the stakes are high. Ana P. Santos reports from Manila. (22.08.2016) Migrant parents are using social media to raise their kids from afar. But a virtual presence enabled by technology is hardly a substitute for the intimacy of physical closeness. Ana P. Santos reports from Paris. (01.03.2016) That was enough to start an investigation into the activities of DenPhil Travel and Tours, a travel agency that Panabe was running from Thisted, northern Denmark, with operations in Quezon City in the Philippines. In 2011, Panabe was found guilty of human smuggling and sentenced to six years in prison. According to the police, Panabe had brought more than 800 Filipinos into Europe via Denmark. The Danish police were unsuccessful in tracking down the immigrants, but that was not the point. \"It was not our intention to prosecute them. We looked at them as victims. We wanted to interview them to know more about Panabe\\'s operations and who her helpers were,\" explained Kjeldgaard. Europol estimated that the business could have made as much as 10 million euros ($10.7 million). \\'Reuniting families\\' DW spoke to Panabe in her small, sparse but tastefully decorated apartment in northern Denmark. She had served three years of her six-year sentence and had been released on probation. While in jail, she took a course in event management and fundraising. Now she was working on finishing her master\\'s degree in business administration. The Danish penal system is considered one of the most humane in the world, which Panabe said she experienced. \"The system is so fair. It gives you every chance to change. You would be ashamed to do something wrong again,\" she said. As she remembers it, on that Thursday when the police came with a warrant for her arrest, she surrendered without protest or fanfare. Panabe did not plead innocence, but today over coffee and against the light drizzle that blanketed the lush green fields of rural Denmark, Panabe asked for understanding. The 46-year-old was both reflective and forward-looking, anxious to clear her conscience. She insisted that her business operations served the purpose of reuniting Filipino families separated by labor migration. On the surface, DenPhil was selling package tours to Europe, but police investigations revealed that the agency was a front for a simple but effective set-up of matching Filipino clients in the Philippines to Filipinos living in Denmark. Accomplices in Denmark would pose as relatives and sponsor a family visit in exchange for cellphones, airplane tickets to a chosen destination or outright cash. Clients paid a \"package rate\" between 7,400 and 9,300 euros-to orchestrate these family visits and secure a Schengen visa and entry into 26 European countries, where they would quietly live and work under the radar as undocumented migrants. Despite the money trail and the deck of falsified documents, her lawyer argued that Panabe was well within the bounds of the business of issuing her clients visas to Europe. What her clients did once they got to Europe was no longer her concern. Panabe\\'s self-defense was more complex. \"There are so many Filipinos in France and Italy who have no [legal] papers. They stay there, work there for so long without seeing their families. I wanted to help them,\" said Panabe. Immigration limbo The Philippines is one of the largest labor-exporting countries in the world, with approximately 10 million Filipinos living overseas as immigrants or as guest workers. Years of state-sponsored labor migration brings in an estimated 23-billion euros to the economy but comes with a social cost of years of separation. While there are no official estimates, extrapolations based on the number of migrant workers abroad indicate that there are about 2.56 million Filipino children of whom one or both parents live abroad. Europe\\'s higher wages beckon, but with few options to migrate legally, Filipinos smuggle themselves to Europe with the help of someone like Panabe who can circumvent the paperwork. The Commission on Filipinos Overseas (CFO), a government office in Manila that oversees migrant welfare and development, estimated that there were more than 860,000 Filipinos living in Europe as of 2013. In France, where Panabe said most of her clients wanted to go, the CFO estimated that as many as 80 percent of the 48,000 Filipinos were \"irregular\" or undocumented. Many of the Filipinos who come to Europe illegally become domestic workers As undocumented migrants, these Filipinos exist in a sort of immigration limbo where they discreetly live and work in their host country but can\\'t go back home. Doing so would mean not being able to return to Europe - and not recovering the estimated $10,000 it took to get there. Self-ascribed altruism Panabe, a native of the Kalinga mountain province in the Philippines, came to Denmark some 15 years ago as the bride of a Danish man she met while he was on holiday in the Philippines. She, like many other Filipino migrants, fled from grinding poverty in the hopes of finding opportunity abroad. Living in Denmark exposed Panabe to the other side of migration. Underneath the shimmer and perceived glamour of life abroad, there was the pain of being separated from family members and the aching possibility of never being with them again. Panabe attributes her self-ascribed altruism to this realization. She insists that her business operations helped reunite families and that she used her business earnings to establish the IDP Foundation, a charity organization bearing her initials, to send poor but deserving students from her province to school. When she was arrested, Panabe said her immediate thought was her scholars and her clients, especially those who had already made a down payment and whose travel papers were being processed. \"What would happen to them?\" is a question she said she asked herself many times. Back in the Philippines, DW tried to find out, tracking down one of the students who appeared in a video thanking the IDP Foundation for its financial assistance. \"This is a big help to me because my parents don\\'t have money,\" the teenage boy told DW via email. The boy, who asked not to be named, said that he was promised a 90-euro-monthly stipend as an IDP scholar, but alleged that he never received any financial support from IDP. In 2011, under a small grants initiative, the Canadian government awarded the IDP Foundation a grant of over 20,000 euros-for a water and sanitation project in the Kalinga province. The Canadian Embassy in Manila confirmed the grant was released to IDP. Audit reports on the project were not readily available, but the Canadian government confirmed completion of the project and full disbursement of funds. Panabe, who was contacted via email and SMS, declined to comment on these two initiatives. This story was supported by a travel grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.'],\n",
       " ['Gerhard Richter, savior of contemporary painting, turns 85 From photo-like paintings to out-of-focus works, he is consistently inconsistent and beyond his time. Gerhard Richter, at 85, claims to have to system - but has become one of the world\\'s most expensive artists. Gerhard Richter can walk through his chosen hometown of Cologne virtually unrecognized. He is inconspicuous, humble in appearance - a small, bearded and bespectacled man. What stands out about him is his constantly searching and questioning gaze. Critics have referred to Richter as a \"21st-century Picasso.\" He is one of the most successful painters alive today, and his works hang in the world\\'s most important museums. Artworks with his signature on them fetch record-breaking sums. \"The Reader\" (1994) is pictured here at the New National Gallery The \"Kunstkompass\" section of the magazine \"Capital\" has listed Richter as the top-grossing living artist. Needless to say, he\\'s also been showered with awards. The 20th-century Picasso Just like Picasso, who paved the way for modern art in the 20th century, Richter is hardly interested in fame. And he loves women - he\\'s now on his third marriage. Yet unlike the Spanish painter, Richter is not one for the public spotlight. He rarely provides interviews and hardly appears at the art world\\'s glamorous gatherings. Quite the opposite of Picasso, Richter does not allow his personal life to influence his work. As his biographer Dietmar Elger noted, when painting private situations, Gerhard Richter always denied connections to his own life. - \"Candle\" (1982) on display at Baden-Baden\\'s Frieder Burda Museum One thing he does share with Picasso: he is stylistically above and beyond other artists. That is true of his early Pop Art-inspired images and early attempts at abstract expressionism in the 1960s, which he referred to as \"capitalistic realism.\" Slamming consumerism, it is Richter\\'s ironic response to the official art doctrine of the former GDR, \"socialist realism.\" That is something he left behind when he fled Dresden for West Germany in 1961. An \\'Atlas\\' through the ages Shortly afterward, Richter started his \"Atlas,\" something of a motive archive which compiled newspaper clippings, photographs, sketches, color studies, landscapes, portraits, still lifes, historical textiles and collages. It has been updated throughout the decades and was on display in 1997 at the Documenta in Kassel. He paints landscapes, seascapes and cloud pictures in the Romantic tradition. Still lifes and portraits are also in his repertoire. Richter has brought modern painting into the photography era and, in doing so, he creates something new each time. 48 famous men, a part of \"Atlas\" Inconsistency is his trademark: Sometimes he creates photo-realistic nature portraits or out-of-focus paintings sometimes he employs glass and mirrored objects. Installations and overlaid paintings are part of his work as are the later orgies of color that span the length of a wall. Examples of the latter are currently see on display at the Museum Ludwig in Cologne, which is holding a special exhibition of his work through May 1, 2017. \"I don\\'t have any agenda - no system or direction,\" Richter said of his art in 1966. \"I don\\'t have any program or style, no objective.\" A German savior of the art of painting That seems hard to believe. It would be hard to find anyone else who has explored the depths of painting as deeply and readily as Gerhard Richter. It was he who had accomplished something few in the art world believed possible. \"Richter saved the art of painting in the 21st century,\" his biographer and head of the Gerhard Richter Archive at the Kunstsammlungen in Dresden, Dietmar Elger, told DW in an interview. Richter\\'s computer-generated stained glass window in the Cologne Cathedral \"I am fascinated by coincidence,\" the artist recently said. \"Nearly everything is a coincidence. How we are made, why I was born here and not somewhere in Africa - everything is happenstance.\" One of Richter\\'s much-discussed public works of art is a stained glass window in the Cologne Cathedral. He left the design of the window and its 11,000 colored square pieces up to a computer. It is as multi-faceted and unfathomable as the rest of the collection of works by the artist, who turns 85 on February 9. He came from East Germany, spent his adulthood West Germany and managed to become famous worldwide as a representative of unified Germany - even though few here would recognize him if they were to walk right by. - Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/2Wl1p'],\n",

       " ['What happens with German renewables in the dead of winter? Germany has a reputation for being a renewable energy leader - but some believe that the nation\\'s long, still and dim winters threaten such green aspirations. The \"dark doldrums\" conjures images of the deep Middle Ages, when the only light to be had flickered from a tallow candle. In fact, it is-the loose translation for the German word Dunkelflaute, which describes this time of year, when neither sun nor wind are to be found in great abundance. And this is the very scenario-some are suggesting could plunge the nation into, if not quite a reenactment of its medieval past, then energy uncertainty.- An article published recently in the German daily \"Die Welt\" warned that the-Dunkelflaute-could be pushing Germany\\'s power supply to its limits. Drawing on statistics from the-Agora Energiewende energy think-tank and policy laboratory, the report-said that on the days around-January 24, 2017, as much as 90 percent of the country\\'s power was provided by coal, gas and nuclear. And not by renewables --which does not, the article continued, bode well for national plans to transition to a clean, green energy future. Stefan Kapferer, Managing Director of the Federal Association of the Energy and Water Industry-(BDEW) told DW that January was marked by a combination of lower-than-average temperatures, a high demand in electricity and extreme fluctuations in input from wind and solar power. \"Flexible, conventional power stations are essential if we are to stabilize the electricity network,\" he said. \"We have to be able to cover energy demand regardless of the weather.\" What happens with wind power when there\\'s no breeze? And that, Kapferer continued, implies a need for flexible gas and coal power stations,-and further down the line, combined heat and power plants. This-would make it possible to \"integrate renewables into the energy provision system,\" so they become \"supporting pillars\" of supply. The storage issue But Ralph Kampwirth, spokesman for green energy provider Lichtblick, proposes a different solution to what he says doesn\\'t appear to be an \"unsolvable problem.\" Though he concedes that if the country is depending on wind and sun for electricity, the weather is a critical factor - but-he takes a different view on-how to secure supply. \"Mainly it\\'s a question of storage,\" he told DW. \"What we think will happen in the future is that we will have a more decentralized energy production system, at a regional or even household level, and mainly based on solar.\" He is convinced that Germany is on the cusp of a whole new era in the way renewable power can be-stored, because people-looking to install photovoltaic solar-panels will do so in conjunction with-storage capacity. \"There will be a tipping point,\" he said, adding that he believes it will be reached within the next five years. \"There are many players investing in these technologies, so we believe it will happen.\" More light than dark But the possibility of a breakthrough in storage within the next five years is not a given.- Christoph Podewils, Director of Communications at Agora Energiewende, says that while it would be nice to see advances, present-storage facilities will suffice until Germany is generating 70 percent of its power from renewables (currently, renewables make up about 30 percent of Germany\\'s energy mix). As for the prospect of the dark doldrums, he says it is less \"a serious problem,\" and more \"a challenge which has to be considered.\" The issue, he stresses, is an annual event, a response to Germany\\'s January weather patterns. And indeed, a glance though the think-tank\\'s onlinetracking tool-shows just that. So what is the solution? \"Right now, we don\\'t need one,\" Podewils told DW. \"We have massive overcapacity in the power system in Germany and in some other European countries --and as long as that exists, we can continue as we are for years.\" The future face of Germany? He pointed-out that on January 24, at the height of this year\\'s Dunkelflaute, the country had so much overcapacity-that it was still exporting to neighboring countries. This-situation, he holds, is unlikely to change in the coming years. And when nuclear goes offline in 2022, he says the shortfall will be covered by a higher use of gas and offshore wind power. Which still leaves coal. \"We need to reduce coal power,\" he said, \"so if you are going to shut that down, you need a backup.\" Podewils believes the conversation will-then turn to gas-fired power plants. Beyond-that, there are plenty of options to insure the future is light. Even on days when the sun doesn\\'t shine.'],\n",
       " ['German Chancellor Merkel \\'working to hold the EU together\\' German Chancellor Angela Merkel has changed course and is now advocating a Europe of \"two speeds.\" Her goal is to save the European project. Many do not agree with her means to the end. Max Hofmann reports from Brussels. The German chancellor\\'s last appearance at the EU summit in Malta was delayed. It was originally slated for 6:00 p.m. on Friday, but her press statement kept getting pushed back later into the evening. The longer the waiting period was extended, the more journalists left the room to finish their stories on time. It meant that very few people were present to hear what Angela Merkel finally had to say at around 8:00 p.m.: \"The history of recent years has shown that there will be a multi-speed EU, and not all members will participate in the same steps of integration.\" The statement was barely mentioned in European media that weekend. Szydlo did not contradict Merkel\\'s suggestion statement Yet it was the first time that Merkel clearly claimed this old idea as her own. Whoever believed it was an exclusive statement had to think again on the following Tuesday. In a meeting with Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo, Merkel once again spoke of a Europe of \"two speeds.\" Szydlo and her country are normally opponents of this idea, but she did not contradict Merkel this time. From her point of view, the German chancellor has decided to take a pragmatic path for crisis-ridden Europe. She will follow it with her quiet determination. \"That should be taken seriously,\" an EU diplomat in Brussels told DW. \\'You see the challenges, don\\'t you?\\' At the upcoming summit in Rome, state and government heads not only want to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the European Economic Community, they also want to present a vision of a post-Brexit European Union. Right now it looks like a two-speed Europe will be part of this vision. Even though such a structure would allow every country the freedom to join - or not join - a project based on national decisions, many feel uneasy about it. One of them is Latvia\\'s foreign minister Edgars Rinkevics. \"A few years ago, I would have thought it was a bad idea,\" he told DW. \"You see the challenges, don\\'t you?\" Latvia\\'s Rinkevics said the challenges were clear The truth is that Europe has worked at different speeds for decades. The eurozone, the freedom of movement embedded in the Schengen agreement and the Maastricht Social Protocol are already part of a \"phased integration\" in which not all EU member states take part. In the future, different combinations are conceivable, like the eurozone, a core Europe driven by Germany and France or a circle of the EU\\'s founding members. But that may also be part of the problem. Are national interests driving the EU further apart because the bonds have loosened? \"At some point we will have a situation in which the decisions of a core group are not compatible with the positions of the others,\" warns Rinkevics. Keep the EU project So the question is whether the EU is selling its soul by entertaining the idea of a two-speed union. In times of Brexit, Donald Trump, the euro crisis and the immigration crisis, many politicians can do more than to argue that they want to keep the show running even if it means departing from a unified Europe. The EU has lost its \"strategic focus\" because of its many crises, says the European politician Tanja Fajon, a Slovenian social democrat who fears that her small country on the eastern edge of the bloc will fall apart in a multi-speed Europe. She says Slovenia has no objections to the national interest policies of larger states or alliances in the EU. \"The basic idea was actually that we are equal partners and benefit from common policies,\" says Fajon. Fajon said the strategic focus has been lost But now, some countries, like Hungary, refuse to cooperate when it comes to sensitive topics, one of them being the distribution of refugees in the EU. What is the bloc worth if solidarity is officially ruled out in favor of a Europe a la carte? \"We are in an unprecedented situation,\" said Rinkevics. The goal is to save the European project. This applies to the common currency and the economy in particular. The next Greek crisis is at Europe\\'s doorstep, and-maybe even a trade war with Donald Trump\\'s United States. Before everything goes down the drain, Merkel is trying to at least maintain the shell of the union. Maybe the mutual project will be expanded someday in a less EU-hostile future. The idea of a multi-speed union is perhaps Angela Merkel\\'s last attempt at saving Europe.'],\n",

The Royal Air Force\\'s aerobatic team, the Red Arrows, escort a Lockheed Martin F-35B to kick off the action at Farnborough. But despite all the excitement up in the clouds, it\\'s rather quiet on the ground - there has been a lack of spectacular order announcements so far. A look inside the cockpit of a Bombardier CS100 passenger plane. The Canadian manufacturer\\'s 110-to-150-seat jets prove that it\\'s not only size that matters. Air Canada, Swiss Airlines and Delta Airlines are on its list of recent buyers. Customers pledged to buy planes, helicopters and drones worth $201 billion (180 billion euros) at the last Farnborough air fair two years ago. Compared to that, this year\\'s order books seem rather empty. The military transport aircraft A400M is causing Airbus trouble. Certain parts of its exterior are prone to cracking, and now problems with its engine have been flagged as well. Still, Airbus plans to showcase the A400M\\'s advantages at Farnborough. As countries like China and India grow wealthier, their aircraft demand will rise - or at least that\\'s what the plane industry hopes. So far, it looks like their predictions are coming true. Chinese airlines Donghai and Xiamen have ordered dozens of planes worth $7.4 billion (6.6 billion euros) from Boeing. Farnborough is perfect for aircraft fans who want to get up close and personal with their favorite planes. While business folk romp about the exhibition grounds during the week, the fair opens up to the general public on the weekend. Author: Rolf Wenkel Europe\\'s largest defense project years behind schedule Germany\\'s A400M program is years behind schedule, with the federal government\\'s share of the costs having risen from an initial estimate of 8.1 billion euros to 9.6 billion euros. Germany is the largest customer of A400M planes, having initially agreed to purchase 53 of them from Airbus. The Defense Ministry maintains that it has a good contract with Airbus that allows it to demand compensation for delays and other technical issues. The A400M was due to completely replace the older \"Transall\" aircraft-by next year. Officials now expect that transition to be completed by 2022 at the latest. The new aircraft was developed as part of a program for seven European NATO states with an initial estimated cost of 20 billion euros. Tuesday\\'s episode coincided with reports that Germany is looking to maintain access to more A400M planes through a pooling agreement with several countries, backtracking on initial-plans to sell 13 on of the 52 it has agreed to buy.

Borussia Dortmund beat Hertha Berlin on penalties and Eintracht Frankfurt edged out Hannover in a dramatic finale. Lotte 2-0 1860 Munich (Lindner 28, Freiberger 58') Third tier Lotte scored a goal in each half as they eased to a comfortable win over second tier 1860. Jaroslaw Lindner opened the scoring from a tight angle, lashing a venomous shot into the roof of the net after 1860 keeper Stefan Ortega parried the ball to his right. 1860 battled for a route back into the game but their hopes of drawing level were extinguished when- Kevin Freiberger beat the offside trap and poked the ball around Ortega and stroked into the empty net. The visitors' misery was complete when Ribamar was sent off in the last minute for a mindless foul. -  Frankfurt's players celebrate with goalkeeeper Lucas Hradecky, who saved a penalty at the death Hannover 96 1-2-Eintracht Frankfurt (Harnik 57' - Tawatha 62', Seferovic 66') Hannover's Salif Sane missed a 96th minute penalty as Frankfurt reached the last eight in a dramatic finale. Martin Harnik seized on some uncertain Frankfurt defending to open the scoring, poking the ball under Lucas Hradecky. But Frankfurt responded five minutes later through Taleb Tawatha's header from Timothy Chandler's cross. Only four minutes after that frankfurt had the lead, with Seferovic pouncing on a poor defensive header and slotting the ball home. Hannover had the chance to force extra time when they were awarded a penalty deep into injury time, but Sane's poor penalty was saved by-Hradecky. -  Hertha Berlin pushed Dortmund all the way but eventually lost on penalties Borussia Dortmund 1-1 Hertha Berlin (Dortmund won 3-2 on pens) (Reus 47' - Kalou 27') Salomon Kalou missed the crucial penalty as Borussia Dortmund edged out Hertha Berlin on penalties. Kalou had put Hertha ahead with a fine volley in front of the S¨¹dtrib¨¹ne, stretching to deftly direct Niklas Stark's cross into the net. Hertha took their lead into the break, but Thomas Tuchel's side responded two minutes after the restart, with Marco Reus steering the ball in after Ousmane Dembele's initial effort had come back off the post. With the game in the final minutes of extra time, Dortmund's Sokratis was sent off for dissent just ahead of the shootout, which was clinched when Kalou sent his penalty high over the bar. -  Schalke celebrate their second goal of four in Sandhausen Sandhausen 1-4 Schalke (Wooten 65' - Sch?pf 38', Caligiuri 43', Naldo 45', Konoplyanka 71') Schalke turned on the style as they swept second tier Sandhausen aside. Alessandro Sch?pf's scrappy strike from close range opened the floodgates, with Daniel Caligiuri doubling Schalke's lead with a well struck shot and Naldo making it three with a header in first half stoppage time. Sandhausen gave themselves a lifeline midway through the second half through Andrew Wooten, but Yevheniy Konoplyanka completed the rout with Schalke's fourth. - Wednesday's action as it happened:\"],\n",

Regional governments also oppose taking in refugees who have already reached the European Union. Countries along a route commonly used by people trying to reach central and western Europe agreed on Wednesday to fortify their already hard borders. Since authorities reintroduced border fences and increased checks nearly a year ago, the number of refugees traveling through the western Balkans in attempts to reach northern EU nations from Greece has been sharply curtailed. \"We\\'re sending a signal to the traffickers with this conference that there will be no illegal migration to Europe,\" Austrian Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka told reporters after Wednesday\\'s talks in Vienna. He spoke of new \"border control measures\" as part of the plan but did not elaborate what the plans entailed. Talks in Vienna brought together defense and interior ministers from Austria, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Serbia , -Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo and Greece. In 2015, some of those countries became arrival or transit points for the hundreds of thousands of people fleeing conflict and unsustainable conditions in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia.- What\\'s next The conference\\'s participants said they planned to identify the most prevalent routes used by displaced people and any potential alternatives and arrive at an estimate of how much additional manpower they might need to shut the borders down.

       " ['Harsh parenting leads to bad students, earlier sex and more crime Overly strict parenting does not a rule-abiding child make, according to a long-term study. Children whose parents severely punish them perform more poorly in the classroom - if they\\'re there at all. Yelling, corporal punishment or verbal threats of physical consequences, or-\"harsh parenting,\" as it was defined in a new long-term study, causes children to perform poorly in school and to behave badly outside of it. According to researchers at the University of Pittsburgh in the US state of Pennsylvania, children raised in a severe parental environment are more likely to skip homework to play with friends and more willing to break rules in order to maintain those friendships - at the consequence of academic performance. The researchers derived their conclusions from a longitudinal study on more than 1,500 adolescents between the ages of 12 and 21, collected as part of the Maryland Adolescent Development in Context study. That study had measured the extent to which parents\\' verbal or physical attacks grew over time, as well as the adolescents\\' interactions with peers, their criminal activities and sexual behavior. Students self-reported those answers via questionnaire and were asked questions such as the following: \"During the past month, how often did you parents hit, push, grab or shove you?\" \"How often did your parent yell at you?\" \"When you break one of your parents\\' rules, how often did they physically punish you?\" Supportive but firm parenting leads to more successful kids One finding was that 7th graders who\\'d been raised very strictly were, two years later, more likely to consider peers and friends more important than following their parents\\' own rules. Later, by 11th grade, these individuals were then involved in even riskier behaviors: Young women tended to engage earlier in sexual activity, while males were more likely to be involved in criminal activities. Both genders were also more likely to drop out of high school or college. Risks of underreporting Co-author Rochelle Hentges told DW that, in spite of the inherent risks in self-reporting, allowing kids to provide the information was the best option. \"One of the reasons for child reporting is that parents are biased and tend to underreport their own behavior,\" she said. \"Maybe they don\\'t remember the times they yelled at their kids. But from the kids\\' perspective, it\\'s clear.\" She added that adolescents, however, might underreport-things like delinquencies or early sexual behavior. Of the participants in the study, 56 percent were African-American - not necessarily representative of the entire US, but representative of some suburban, urban and rural environments. When asked about-the moral and ethical difficulty in measuring corporal punishment amongst adolescents - and whether researchers are obliged to report certain kinds of abuse (potentially changing study results) - Hentges said that longitudinal research is able to avoid such conflicts. \"The way long-term studies are usually done is that the responses are de-identified. They\\'re all anonymous, you can\\'t match a response to an individual. So you couldn\\'t follow up.\" -As for the conclusion parents could or should draw from the new report, Hentges said it isn\\'t exactly a plea for overly soft parenting, either. -\"A lot of time people tend to view parenting as one of two extremes. You\\'re either too permissive or lenient, or you spank your child and be firm and harsh,\" she said. \"That\\'s not really how it has to be. You can have warm, supportive, but firm, boundaries - with clear consequences that are not physical punishment.\" The report was published in the US journal \"Child Development.\" with dpa'],\n",
       " ['Germany building too few homes, and the wrong kind German cities are building too few new apartments to keep up with their growth, according to a new economic study. Not only that, the apartments that are being built are the wrong size - especially in Berlin. It\\'s nothing new-that German cities are running out of affordable housing,-but up until-now it wasn\\'t clear that the wrong types of apartments were also being built. That\\'s the major new insight in a study published this week by the economic think tank,-Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW). Only 32 percent of the necessary new apartments were built in Germany\\'s major cities between 2011 and 2015, the study found - putting-growing pressures on the housing market. The IW also discovered-a particular scarcity in Berlin - where only 25 percent of the demand was being covered - in particular,-of two-to-four-room apartments. Meanwhile,-there was barely any-shortage of-up-market-apartments. While the market had successfully covered 97 percent of the demand for five-room apartments across Germany, only 30 percent of the necessary two-room apartments were being built - and in Berlin, the figure was as low as 20 percent. \"We\\'re not building the apartments where they\\'re needed,\" study author Michael Voigtl?nder said.-Altogether, Germany needs 385,150 new apartments every year over the next three years, the IW concluded, with the nation\\'s capital, which is currently growing by 40,000 people annually, needing some 31,230 every year. Developers have no incentive to build cheap housing More building? \"That was pretty surprising, that there was such a drastic shortage of small apartments,\" Voigtl?nder told DW. \"The fact that large apartments are being built, even though people need two or three room apartments.\" For Voigtl?nder, the problem is obvious - lack of-room. \"The investors do want to build, but there\\'s a lack of building land,\" he said. \"And if there\\'s a lack of building land, then of course they build what gets them the biggest margins - and that\\'s the biggest and most expensive apartments.\" The solution, therefore, is to find more room to build, and an aerial view of Berlin shows there is space in major German cities.-\"Not only that,-we need to see that we make better-use of-what we have,\" he added. \"Cheaper homes don\\'t necessarily come from new buildings - we have to find incentives for landlords to offer sub-lets, for example, or incentives to divide up large apartments into smaller ones.\" Voigtl?nder also thinks that some regulations - for example for renovating attic floors - are too strict. \"You could certainly adjust-some of the screws here and there,\" he said. \"But the essential thing is building space.\" Rich well-served, poor left to struggle But others think the problems are much deeper. Wibke Werner, deputy director of Berlin\\'s tenants association, the Mieterverein, thinks there are a lot more reasons why German cities are struggling to house their inhabitants. \"Another problem is that most of the new apartments are for owning, not renting,\" she told DW. \"Given that more than half of Berliners have a relatively low income, the demand is nowhere near covered for now. And even when they build smaller apartments, they\\'re usually fairly luxurious.\" The Berlin government is struggling to find a solution Werner doubts whether it\\'s even possible to cover the demand with new building, since private developers have no incentive to build cheap homes, and state property companies only account for about 16 percent of Berlin\\'s property. Meanwhile, most-of the-undeveloped land in inner city Berlin is also in private hands. For Werner, a solution might be to offer incentives to private developers to build cheaper homes - something the new Berlin government (a center-left coalition of Social Democrats, Greens, and the Left party) has failed to do: \"They\\'re concentrating on the city- and council-owned companies, and avoiding the question of how they\\'re getting the private developers and landlords on board too,\" she said, before admitting, \"But then again, it is a difficult question to answer.\" At the end of the day, the state needs to offer developers some cash, Werner concluded.-\"Some kind of subsidy that is more attractive than what they can get on the market,\" she said -This, she suggested, could be tied to regulations on how many two or three-room apartments should be included in any new buildings. Behind this problem there is also the question of growing land price speculation through hedge funds - but that is an area that can only be regulated at the federal level.'],\n",
       " ['R.I.P. Hans Rosling: Goodbye King of Data Colorful statistics, jumping bubbles - the Swedish professor entertained us with presentations that were more entertaining than any theater play. Rosling explained the world\\'s problems with ease. Data-Guru Hans Rosling died on February 7,-2017. His organization Gapminder sent out a tweet with the information late Tuesday evening Swedish time. Rosling was a scientist-who made an art form out of explaining the world to us-while never losing his hope for humanity. Rosling\\'s relatives explained the circumstances of the professor\\'s death: He was suffering from pancreatic cancer - a very treacherous form of tumor. Rosling was diagnosed with the disease roughly one year ago. The statistics expert, who was teaching international health at the Karolinska-Institute in Stockholm, lost the fight against the tumor at the age of 68. He spent his last day with his family in Uppsala. His son Ola Rosling and daughter-in-law Anna Rosling R?nnlund acknowledged that the message must have come unexpected and saddened many of his fans. But they asked to respect the family\\'s-privacy and promised to continue Roslings mission: \"Hans is no longer alive, but he will always be with us and his dream of fact-based worldview, we will never let die!,\" they wrote. On social media, people reacted slowly to the tragic news. There were no agency-reports, no breaking news - just a few tweets. - While scrolling through his last tweets, I notice-how Hans Rosling\\'s death also touches me. This is probably-because I don\\'t only know him from his legendary TED-talks and from videos on youtube, but had an opportunity to meet him in person at the 2014 Lindau Nobel Laureate\\'s meeting. During the meeting - right after his presentation during the opening session - I-admit-I lost all journalistic distance. While I was sitting across from him and recording my interview, his wife was scurrying around us, until he asked her to leave, \"so the recording would turn out alright without all that background noise.\" Getting rid of frustration- Then he let off steam and told me - in what felt like an endless flow of words - what a sobering experience his presentation was. Sobering to-him, not-to his captivated audience. He was surprised how little the young scientists and even some of the Nobel laureates knew of the world. At the same time I was relieved to get a break from asking my own questions. I was humbled:-I would-have hardly scored any better in the presentation, which he designed as a quiz. But I was also speechless about the torrent of numbers and data coming at me. Rosling must be an extraordinary talent, I hoped, with-a passion for statistics that-I simply did-not have. \"Wrong,\" he countered. Alright then. People before data The only course in statistics he ever took-was a semester-long class after med school, he said. It wasn\\'t-the numbers and figures that interested him, but the people behind them. \"The data is only a way to understand how life really is,\" he explained. Looking above the rim of his glasses: \"That makes me look ten years older, but 100 times more clever\" he said. The one thing Rosling could not explain very well is how he came to be an Edutainer. That\\'s what he called-himself. \"It was by pure accident\", he said. Rosling liked telling stories at school. Maybe he had a gift for it. No do-gooder And he-used this gift-well. After his studies he spent two decades in Africa, researching and giving lectures about economic development, agriculture, health and poverty - not only focusing on Africa. He also served as an advisor for the United Nations Children\\'s Fund (UNICEF). I asked him-whether he thought it would be-possible to make the world a better place. Rosling smiled and said that wasn\\'t-his intention. \"It\\'s a bit-much to demand\", he said and added that he just wanted-to correct the way people look at the world.- It\\'s the way he produced-his message on stage-that-won him the admiration of many data geeks and statisticians. And he received countless prizes and medals for his work. 2012 he even landed on the list of the \"Times\" 100 most influential people in the world. These are not little facts he drops in conversation, but details a journalist comes across when preparing for an-interview. A real Rosling fan, of course, will know this by heart. A family affair Rosling noted that the idea for his presentations came from his family. It was in 1998-when his son Ola together with Anna programmed the first version of movable bubbles - to enhance the university lectures of the medicine professor and make them more attractive and easy to understand. So it was the son and daughter-in-law-who developed the Ferrari. \"Im just driving it,\" Rosling said and laughed. The concept developed into a foundation named Gapminder:-a project to support free information and knowledge. Looking ahead In the interview I did with Rosling in 2014, he-also showed a private side. All of a sudden, the giant numbers and dimensions from the presentation shrank in size. \"My grandkids will live until the next century. I am never talking about anything abstract. I am talking about my loved ones. It\\'s all about their future,\" he told me at the end of our conversation. Abstract-you never were, Hans. You could not have explained yourself in a better way to us. Let your message - along with your jumping bubbles and colorful statistics - continue to-inspire us to go through the world with open eyes.'],\n",

But that\\'s about to change with a business forum in Nairobi where over 400 representatives backed by top politicians are attending the German-African Business Summit (GABS). The German delegation is led by economic minister, Brigitte Zypries, and development minister, Gerd Mueller. Germany\\'s Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel is also lined up as a speaker at the forum. On the African side, high ranking politicians from five different countries are attending the forum along with the host-nation Kenya led by President Uhuru Kenyatta, who is opening the three-day summit.- In the run up to the summit, the German side already made their intentions clear. \"The German economy is missing out on this market,\" said Development Minister Mueller a few weeks ago on the national broadcaster ZDF. Germany wants to improve standard of living in sub-Sahara Africa to reduce the flow of migrants Germany\\'s economic engagement with Africa is important to Berlin\\'s Africa agenda for a few reasons. On one hand, the German government wants to control the high influx of migrants and refugees from Africa. Berlin had said in order to reduce the number of people forced to flee to Europe, living conditions in sub-Saharan Africa must be improved. \"If we do not solve the problems in Africa, they will come to us sooner or later,\" said Mueller a few weeks ago. On the other hand, German politics is also about jobs creation. \"Many politicians see that Africa is becoming very interesting as an investment location and market,\" said development expert Elvira Schmieg from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs,-(SWP) in Berlin. \"For a long time, Europe was Africa\\'s most important source for importing, and it\\'s still the case, but it has lost that importance,\" Schmied told DW. China ahead of Germany Big businesses in Africa are currently doing extraordinary things, especially in host country Kenya, where Chinese companies are building a railway line costing almost 14 billion euros ($15-billion)-between the main seaport of Mombasa and the capital Nairobi. Eventually, the railway will be extended to neighboring Uganda. Countries such as China and India are becoming the most important trading partners in Africa. The common gross domestic product of the continent has quintupled since 1990, there are still huge mineral resources in the continent and the population is still growing. But German firms have been holding back. Only around 1,000 companies are active on the African continent, according to the development ministry. Approximately two-thirds of these investments are directed towards South Africa. German car-maker VW opened a factory production line in Kenya in 2016 So far, Germany allocates-only two to three percent of its overall foreign investment to-Africa, which is considered very low. \"Even though we are continuously talking about Africa as a continent of opportunities, the German economy has to play an enormous catch up,\" said Heinz-Walter Grosse, chairman of the Sub-Saharan Africa Initiative of the German Economy (SAFRI), the organizers of the summit. Grosse emphasizes that more and more foreign companies are taking keen interest in Africa. \"I believe that the African continent has also evolved over the past twelve months to an extent that its attracting interests from German companies,\" said the SAFRI boss in a DW interview. More security for German investments Nonetheless, many German companies are still afraid of investing in Africa. German CEOs are afraid of the political instability in some African countries. The high rates of corruption are also an obstacle to investment. Economic associations such as SAFRI are therefore pushing for more state guarantees to safeguard potential risk investments. Development minister Mueller also proposed a number of steps in his \"Marshall Plan with Africa.\" Kenya\\'s President Uhuru Kenyatta (left) has been pushing for increasing German investments But this alone is not enough to boost German investment in Africa, according to SWP\\'s expert Schmied. She thinks it is important for medium-sized companies to have political stability and a good balance of payment from their African partners: \"In the long run, it will be absolutely crucial as to how the general conditions in Africa evolve. [For now,] we can only work with the current limited development tools at our disposal,\" she said.'],\n",

The prima ballerina from the world-renowned Mariinski Theater in St. Petersburg danced her way not only into the heart of theater audiences but also into the heart of Russian Tsar Nikolai II. A love affair ensued, which Russia is now, more than 100 years later, set to learn about. At least that was the plan of Russian filmamker Alexei Uchitel, whose dream could now be struck down by Russia\\'s religious public and the Kremlin-loyal representative of the Duma, Natalia Poklonskaya, who has twice engaged state prosecutors to stop the film\\'s release. Charge 1: insulting the monarchy Poklonskaya and the Russian Orthodox organization \"The Christian State - Holy Russia\" are incensed that the film contains erotic scenes featuring the character of Nikolai II. They have not, however, seen the film themselves as it is first set for theater release in October. Politician of protest: Duma representative Natalya Poklonskaya Nikolai II, the last Russian tsar, who was murdered by the Bolsheviks in 1918, has been canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church. According to the logic of the complaints against th film, a saint may not have relations with anyone besides his wife, even more marriage - and especially not with a dancer. It is an insult to the monarchy to suggest as much. To add insult to injury, the tsar is played by a German actor, Lars Eidinger. Charge 2: offending religious sentiment Poklonskaya\\'s first attempt at a ban was unsuccessful with state prosecutors. The judiciary found no reason for the ban after viewing the trailer to the movie. Now the Duma representative, who happens to have been the chief state prosecutor in the Russian-annexed Crimean peninsula until just recently, is trying again with the accusation of \"offending religious sentiment,\" which is an indictable charge. The group \"The Christian State - Holy Russia\" has threatened to burn down cinemas that show \"Matilda\" and have spoken of tumult. \"Every film poster and advertisement with information about \\'Matilda\\' will be seen as an attempt at diminishing the holiness of the Russian Orthodox Church and as a provocation to incite a \\'Russian Maidan.\\'\" The latter is a reference to the Maidan Revolution in Ukraine, named after the square in Kyiv where protests began in 2014. The writers of the letter quoted above boasted that they have written to over 100 cinema directors, a move they said they made in order to fight \"lawlessness\" and \"madness.\" Russia\\'s ministry of culture supported \\'Matilda\\' Uchitel, the director of \"Matilda,\" sees ominous moral extremists at play behind the scenes. His spokesperson, Andre Shishkanov says he would like to use the law to go up against the organization and hopes to gain the support of the state in doing so. In an interview with DW, he says he is assured that Poklonskaya as well as a large spectrum of the Russian public would themselves be \"persuaded by the highly artistic quality of the film, which by the way, received funding from the Russian ministry of culture.\" The film\\'s eroticism has been criticized in Russia The Kremlin has meanwhile criticized threats against Uchitel and his film, although Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov said that such plots are totally unacceptable. In an open letter, over 50 renowned Russian film directors have hit back against the creeping censorship in Russia, something which had destroyed artists\\' existences for decades during the Soviet Union and delayed artistic development: \"We want to live in a global, democratic country, where censorship is not only forbidden on paper but also in reality.\" \\'The truly religious wouldn\\'t watch this film\\' One of the signatories of the open letter is the Russian filmmaker Vitaly Mansky, director of the prize-winning documentary about North Korea, \"Under the Sun.\" Speaking to DW, he criticized the church for using the opportunity to impose their beliefs on people. \"I can remember times when people were chased out of the university because they went to church. I\\'m afraid that soon we will be chased out for not going to church.\" Mansky blames the Russian Orthodox Church for not distancing themselves from the self-proclaimed \"protectors of the faith\" that are campaigning against \"Matilda.\" He sees in the trailer to the film a clear warning to those who are too firm in their beliefs. \"The truly religious wouldn\\'t watch this film. This isn\\'t a historical textbook, but a film story and a purely commercialized product which is set outside of the church and which now should be forbidden outside of the church? The next step would be to have the church tell me what I can do within my own four walls. And then in my head.\" Church asks the sentiments of believers be respected A German as Tsar Nikolai II: Lars Eidinger The press spokesperson for the Russian Orthodox Church, Wachtag Kipshidze, has tried to diffuse the discussion. \"First we have to wait for the film to be released before we can judge it,\" he told DW. \"Of course, one must respect the artistic liberties of the director. At the same time, one likewise has to consider the emotions of people who feel harmed by it.\" The spokesperson did not want to speak directly on the subject of Poklonskaya\\'s initiative to forbid \"Matilda.\" \"The church does not comment on the individual actions of government representatives and does not get involved in political arguments.\" But as a general rule, it would have been \"better, if the director reached out to believers and gained greater understanding.\" No sign of understanding That has thus far not been the case - quite the opposite. Battle lines have been drawn, fronts hardened. Poklonskaya will not let up. Director Aleksei Uchitel wants to hold those who wrote the threatening letters responsible. For him, the action is a reminder of the \"real banditry that took place in the chaotic 1990s.\" His colleagues in the film industry are now starting a counter-protest campaign. They see the way the church is acting as a \"moral censor\" in this case as a further attack on social life in Russia. A life in which entire theater productions disappear from the program, as Wagner\\'s \"Tannh?user\" did recently in the Opera at Novosibirsk. Or in which an entire exhibition must close early, as did one by the avant-garde painter Vadim Sidur.

Protesters, however, have continued to call for the government\\'s resignation. Romania\\'s center-left government has survived-a no-confidence vote on Wednesday, a week after it bypassed parliament and enacted an emergency ordinance in an attempt to legalize some forms of official corruption - a-decree that was scrapped after days of massive protests in the streets of Romania. Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu\\'s government won the no-confidence vote largely owing-to the parliamentary majority enjoyed by the ruling Social Democratic Party (PSD) and its junior partner, the Alliance of Democratic Liberals. The PSD and its allies abstained from participating-during the-no-confidence motion, which-was filed by 123 opposition MPs. The vote needed 233 supporters to pass. Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/2X37S The no-confidence vote came after hundreds of thousands of Romanian citizens took to the streets in protest, the largest seen in the country since the fall of communism in 1989, demonstrating against the corruption decree. The order-was officially rescinded on Sunday, however many protesters have claimed they will continue to march until the government resigns. Anonymous PSD sources told Reuters Justice Minister Florin Iordache, who had a role in writing the decree, is expected to resign on Wednesday.- Protesters remain defiant Grindeanu-continued to call for \"calm and stability\"?leading up to the no-confidence motion and remained adamant he will not step down despite ongoing public criticism. -- He told lawmakers his government will not pursue any similar laws relating to corruption which \"could awake powerful emotions in a society without a proper and wide debate.\" \"I do hope that, as of today, we get back to work\", he said. \"We have a duty to the people who gave us their trust during the election and to continue to govern.\"- The number of protesters have fallen sharply, but are expected to increase into the weekend. A protester told the AFP news agency on Tuesday that many citizens have lost faith in the PSD. \"Every action the government took in the last weeks proves they are not honest at all,\" he said, \"We cannot trust them.\"?Crowd numbers topped approximately half a million on Sunday and are expected to increase again over the weekend. President issues warning- President Klaus Iohannis on Tuesday said the country is in the midst of a \"fully fledged\"-political crisis and criticized the government for issuing the decree \"at night, in secret\"?without properly conferring with parliament. He said the December election had granted democratic governing rights to the PSD, but he also warned against abuse of power. \"If the PSD, which has created this crisis, fails to resolve the crisis immediately, I will summon all the political parties for talks,\" Iohannis told lawmakers in Bucharest, \"You\\'ve won, now govern and legislate - but not at any price.\" International response The ongoing unrest has also-prompted a word of caution-from Romania\\'s Western allies. The European Commission in Brussels advised the Romanian government against \"backtracking\"-over its formerly commended anti-corruption efforts. Meanwhile, in Washington, government officials said they were \"deeply concerned\"-over \"accountability\"-for corruption offenses. im/sms (AFP, AP, Reuters)'],\n",
       " ['Constrained and tamed: Will the Elbe be deepened again? A court in Germany will decide whether Hamburg\\'s Elbe River should be deepened to allow mega freighters to more easily reach the inland port. Environmentalists filed a lawsuit against the move. Now, it\\'s verdict time. \"Finally,\" says Axel Goderath, \"finally the long wait is coming to an end.\" For more than a decade the banker and supporter of the citizens\\' initiative \"Hamburg for the Elbe\" has been involved with the issue of further deepening the river. The city state of Hamburg, with the support of federal government, wants to deepen-the Elbe in the area between the container terminal Altenwerder and-Cuxhaven, where the river intersects with the North Sea. The mega-project at Germany\\'s largest river mouth would be the ninth such carving-out-of the Elbe since 1880. Jobs or nature? Container ships are getting bigger and bigger. But for the ocean giants, the river Elbe becomes a bottleneck. Hamburg, also known as \"the gateway to the world,\" is not as-close to the sea as-its central European competitors Rotterdam and Antwerp. But this city, which was once a hub of the Hanseatic League, was founded on freight. Advocates and opponents are fighting for every single centimeter. It\\'s a question of excavation or conservation, economy or ecology. A-lot of facts, as well as strong emotions. That\\'s why officials do not speak of \"deepening,\" but prefer to call it \"passage adjustment.\" That sounds more innocuous. The environmental protection organization WWF describes the possible expansion as \"undersea deforestation.\" Should the shoreline of the river have to be paved, it would destroy natural salt marshes and rare tidal-floodplain forests, along with flora and fauna. An endangered plant species called the \"Schierlingswasserfenchel\" (Oenanthe coniodes)-which in Europe only grows at the mouth of the Elbe, would be condemned to extinction. And in the summer, anglers and local residents continue to observe dead fish. At higher temperatures and without light, the algae in deeper regions deteriorate. The lawsuit For more than ten years, the affected people, associations and municipalities have been in the fight with authorities, politicians, the Hamburg senate and business representatives. The European Commission-gave a vague statement in 2011, saying \"the project can be carried out for prevailing reasons of public interest, even if the assessment shows the plan has a negative impact on the surrounding areas.\"- Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/14lFH The environmental organizations BUND (Friends of the Earth Germany)-and NABU (Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union),-who have filed a lawsuit against the project, have taken a look at these surrounding areas. In court, there will be no negotiation on the economic aspects. The judges are not concerned with the expectations of the competitiveness of the port. At the moment, 8.8 million containers are handled at the port per year and-that could increase to 13 million.-There are also projections that if the dredging project goes forward, Hamburg could handle some-25 million containers per year. Axel Goderath and-his fellow members of \"Hamburg for the Elbe\" will be there when the Federal Administrative Court-in Leipzig announces on Thursday (9.2.2017) whether the project will be approved. Hamburg as a-logistics hub There is no doubt about the economic role of the port: more than a tenth of all European container handling takes place at the Elbe terminals. Only Rotterdam is higher-on the EU ranking list. But the port is dependent on the global economy and especially on the economic growth of Asian countries. The biggest container ship in the world at the time: The CMA CGM Marco Polo in Hamburg in 2012 \"The deepening of the river Elbe and improved-connections-with-the surrounding-areas are urgently needed,\"-said Professor Henning V?pel from the Hamburg World Economic Institute, HWWI. \"Without the deepening, the container transport will move to Wilhelmshaven, Rotterdam or Genoa,\" the HWWI chief told the-\"Abendblatt\" newspaper. Theoretically, the North German ports of Hamburg and the JadeWeserPort in Wilhelmshaven could work together. Wilhelmshaven-is able to accommodate even the largest ships and is not that far away from Hamburg. However, as a city state, Hamburg is politically independent and has rejected such cooperation. In earlier court cases, the Federal Administrative Court has dealt with the effects of the construction of the Elbe on the river itself and flood. At that time the judges indicated that they consider an expansion indispensable - subject to conditions. \\'Harbor subsidized above all\\' Sabine Klingemann from the citizens\\' initiative \"Hamburg for the Elbe\" once passionately sailed on the Elbe. She is annoyed that \"the port in Hamburg is put above all and is being subsidized, while in other areas such as social welfare, there are constant cuts.\" In Hamburg, the Elbe and port are omnipresent - the city has grown around them. At least 640 million euros is planned for the deepening of about one meter.- Hamburg\\'s port faces competition from other ports in Germany and neighboring countries \"If you calculate the running costs, the expansion of the rail network and roads so that trucks can transport the containers into the country, the costs will raise to 8 billion euros,\" Klingemann said. Environmentalists fear an increase in storm surges if the water flows even faster and rises higher at high tide. Flood protection measures would be needed. The port area would have to be expanded. The Elbe already has to be excavated regularly to remove the tens of millions of cubic meters of sludge that is swept from the North Sea into the inland waters. The costs for this amounted to 132 million euros in 2015. That sediment is a habitat for crabs, worms, mussels and sea snails. Ship owners calling the shots Horst Domnik\\'s-heart-also beats for the Elbe, but against the expansion. His father was a ship builder. \"In the 1960s this place was swarming with-seafarers,\" he said. \"Around 40,000 of them worked here. But that\\'s-history now. No one-protested against the automation, digitalization and emigration. And there are hardly any shipyards. The industry has voluntarily surrendered Hamburg.\" As a captain, Domnik steered-ships on the Elbe. The ship owners had earlier built their ships according to the size of the river and the port. But now it is they who determine how the-ports and waterways are designed and built. Furthermore, the captain fears that accidents will increase and the insurance companies could refuse to insure the passages. \"With Wilhelmshaven, Bremerhaven and the Polish port of Gdansk, there are alternatives to Hamburg,\" said-Domnik. Construction work for the concert hall took nearly 10 years. Hamburg\\'s new landmark, carried by over 1,700 reinforced concrete piles, majestically rises up into the sky. An old warehouse was gutted, re-designed and had a futuristic glass covered extension added. The Elbphilharmonie is Hamburg\\'s foremost prestigious building project. The Elbphilharmonie is part of Hamburg\\'s newly developed HafenCity, Europe\\'s largest urban regeneration projects. Since 2001, on an area of some 157 hectares, up to 7,000 apartments, promenades, squares, shops and offices have been created. The western part (green) is completed, the central part (blue) is still under construction and in the eastern part (red), building work is just beginning. The HafenCity is divided into several districts. One of them being the Ã\\x9cberseequartier - or overseas quarter as it would be called in English. It is to become the commercial heart of the HafenCity, creating over 6,000 jobs, with restaurants, hotels, shops and leisure activities including a large cinema. The northern part is pretty much completed but the southern part is still under construction. Part of the Ã\\x9cberseequartier district is the Cruise Center HafenCity, Hamburg\\'s gateway to the world. Here big cruise ships dock and trade fairs are held in the terminal buildings. The building dating from 2004 was only only a temporary solution and will be replaced by a significantly bigger construction with a hotel in early 2017, as Hamburg reacts to the booming sea cruise market. Another architectural masterpiece in the HafenCity is the Marco-Polo-Tower, an eye-catching feature on the waterfront next to the Elbphilharmonie concert hall. The 55-meter-high extravagant apartment tower can be seen from afar. The 17 floors have been differently sculpted to give it the appearance that they are being turned on their axis. Construction of the tower was completed in 2010. For years, a customs fence prohibited direct access to the Spree harbor. In 2013, the free port agreement was lifted and the fence removed. The International Building Exhibition Hamburg, responsible for developing and regenerating the harbor area, had new foot and bicycle paths constructed. A stroll there allows you to see the biggest collection of house boats in Hamburg. By now, Hamburg has a 10-kilometer (6.3-mile) stretch of \"city coastline\" with promenades along the waterfront. They begin at the Deichtorhallen art center, lead past the HafenCity to the landing bridges and beyond the Elbmeile restaurant and shopping area next to the fish market, all the way to Ã\\x96velg?nne. Hamburg doesn\\'t just focus on urban development. Some 1.6 billion euros are to be invested in cultural buildings by 2020. An outstanding example is the Elbphilharmonie. Others include the modernization of the Deichtorhallen art center and two newly constructed musical theater venues. The Bucerius Art Forum (pictured) is currently being extended and a harbor museum is also planned. For years, the Elbe river islands were dominated by dreary high-rises and decaying factory buildings. Wilhelmsburg was seen as a troubled district. The International Building Exhibition Hamburg has also been active here: new apartments were constructed, old buildings redeveloped and social projects initiated. Today the multi-cultural district is popular especially with young families and students. A new district is also emerging in the Mitte Altona area. The Hamburg-Altona railway terminus is to be shut down and the rail tracks removed. The current local train station Diebteich is to be turned into a major rail station. Thousands of apartments are to be built on the area that will become available as there is a permanent demand for accommodation in popular Hamburg. More room for homes is to be created through the new Hamburger Deckel tunnel system. The busy A7 motorway is to be covered at three places to reduce traffic noise. The tunnel deck is to be turned into parks, allotments and community gardens aimed at reconnecting districts. Two of the new tunnels are already being constructed and work on the cover is scheduled to begin in 2019. Author: Elisabeth Yorck von Wartenburg'],\n",

DW: A clear majority in your rural Yorkshire constituency voted for Brexit. Does it trouble you that you are not representing your constituents when you are voting against triggering Article 50? Mary Creagh: I have always tried to do the best for my constituents. But I feel that leaving the EU is against their interests, that the economic consequences of leaving the single market will be so grave that they will be poorer as a result of it. And it is against my DNA. I am the daughter of an Irish immigrant, I have lived abroad in Europe, I believe in the Labour values of solidarity and internationalism, and I can not bring myself to vote for leaving the EU. How important of an issue do you think this is for your constituents? Will you suffer at the next election? An exceptionally large number of people voted in the referendum, much more than normally in general elections, and the vote for Brexit was across all age groups and also all income groups. A lot of young people voted, who had never voted before. But there is no point in having principles if you are not prepared to make sacrifices. I have always said that I will be a Remainer until I die. Labour MP Mary Creagh The political climate in the UK has heated up after Brexit - has that had any effect on you personally? I have had lots of trolls on twitter, Facebook hates, but no death threats or anything severe like that. Someone through a brick through the window of my constituency office, that has happened to several other female Labour MPs as well. And just a few kilometers away, my colleague Jo Cox was murdered for being pro-European, so that is at the back of my mind. We have seen an increase in hate crime since Brexit, and far right activity in Yorkshire is on the rise. Theresa May has promised MPs that they will have a chance to vote at the end of the negotiations with the EU, in less than 2 years time. Is that not an important concession? For me this is not a meaningful vote. She made it clear that she wants to leave the single market and that we will have to choose between the terms that she will have negotiated, and World Trade Organization rules, which is the hardest Brexit possible. I fear that Brexit could be a catastrophe for the country: It will harm us economically, reduce our competitiveness, it will put more pressure on local councils. Already councils are struggling with cuts as a result of austerity politics, libraries and swimming pools are having to close. Brexit will mean less social justice in the future. Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/2X8rX Could there be a rebellion at the vote tonight? Mary Creagh: The leadership of the Labour party believes that it would be antidemocratic to stand in the way of Brexit after we had the referendum. So most of my colleagues are not going to revolt. But there could be more MPs who are going to abstain, also on the Conservative benches. The Leavers in the Conservative Party are very nervous: The bill still has to go through the House of Lords, and MPs will see what it is going to look like after that. There could still be a rebellion at a later point. Mary Creagh is the Labour MP for Wakefield and a former Shadow Secretary of State for International Development. She challenged Jeremy Corbyn for the party-leadership in 2015 but later withdrew her candidacy.\"],\n",
       " ['Detox outdoor: market leader takes harmful PFCs out of weatherproof gear The harmful chemical PFC is often found in raincoats and hiking boots. But a market leader in outdoor gear now wants to do without it. Environmentalists have praised the move and see changes afoot in the industry. Hazardous chemicals do not belong in outdoor clothing. That\\'s why Gore Fabrics, one of the major textile manufacturers in the outdoor apparel-industry, wants to increasingly do away with using per and poly-fluorinated chemicals (PFCs). PFCs are used for making weatherproof membranes and also in the manufacture of- specialized rainproof fabrics. Gore Fabrics is the maker of the well-known Gore-Tex group of products and supplies major outdoor brands like The North Face and Mammut. According to its own reports, the US company has annual sales of about $3 billion. The advantage of PFCs: they repel water, grease and dirt - that\\'s why they\\'re so often used in consumer products, especially in outdoor and performance clothing to provide protection and comfort to the wearer. The drawback is that certain PFCs break down only very slowly-and can interfere with reproductive and hormone systems. PFCs have been spread across the world. Environmental organization Greenpeace found PFC contamination to be \"historic and ongoing\" in the water, air and dust in locations near PFC manufacturing facilities worldwide. In secluded locations such as mountain lakes - the very sorts of places which draw nature lovers, PFC contamination has also been found. Timeline to detox That\\'s why Gore Fabrics now wants to stop using a group of PFCs which it has identified as \"PFCs of Environmental Concern\" in the manufacture of its weatherproof outdoor products such as jackets, shoes and accessories by the end of 2020 (that accounts for about 85 percent of the products it makes using this technology). The remaining 15 percent accounts for specialized products such as uniforms for firefighters and police - Gore Fabrics wants to eliminate PFCs of environmental concern from these products by 2023. \"Our products have always been safe to wear, but Gore recognizes the concerns regarding potential environmental contamination with this group of chemicals and the need for new, more environmentally friendly technologies on the market,\" said Bernhard Kiehl, Gore Fabrics Sustainability Leader in an announcement coinciding with the ISPO sports trade show being held this week in Munich. Outdoor enthusiasts who use gear containing PFCs to keep warm and dry have led the campaign for eco-friendly alternatives \"As a product leader in this sector, Gore Fabrics is excited about the opportunity to drive meaningful change in the outdoor industry by making a very significant investment in developing new technologies that are free of PFCs of environmental concern,\" Kiehl added. The first Gore products with PFC-free waterproofing technology are expected to arrive on the market in about six months. Change in the industry? \"This is a significant step in the transition of the outdoor industry to environmentally-friendly production,\" chemicals expert Manfred Santen from Greenpeace said in reaction to the announcement. \"Because of this decision by the market leader, there will be many more products which do not leave poisonous traces behind in the environment anymore. We also welcome the efforts of Sympatex, the manufacturers of a fluor-free membrane. Both projects show the dynamism with which the industry wants to solve the problem.\" Greenpeace has been calling for years to rid the textile production industry of substances which are detrimental to the environment and human health, by means of a wide-ranging information campaign. More than 30 global fashion brands including H&M, Adidas and Aldi have in the meantime committed to replace harmful substances with non-hazardous alternatives by 2020. According to Greenpeace, consumer awareness and protests have also been helpful in exerting pressure on textile companies. \"The current success shows that you can quickly transform a whole industry,\" Santen-said. To protect people and the environment, Germany and Norway want to restrict the use of PFCs in Europe, but a concrete timeline or list of measures has not yet been put in place. Another problem, according to Germany\\'s environmental protection agency the Umweltbundesamt (UBA), is the use of PFCs in wholly different products, such as paper cups and pizza cartons. Greenpeace doesn\\'t want to wait any longer for politics to take its course - and has taken to the Internet to inform consumers about which outdoor brands are already selling PFC-free products, as well as supporting manufacturers to transition to more environmentally-friendly products and production methods.'],\n",

The show explores humanity\\'s obsession - and unease - with them. Instead of focusing on how they\\'re made, \"Robots,\" the London-Science Museum\\'s new blockbuster exhibition, looks into why humans have always been obsessed with-creating-an automated version of themselves. The exhibition features an extensive collection of over 100 robots, from a 16th-century mechanical-monk to the most advanced models. The development of these human-machines over the last 500 years reflects-religious beliefs, the industrial revolution, popular culture and visions of the future. Androids-are both figures of fascination-and terror. This aspect has guided the organizers of the exhibition, which opens with an animatronic baby that manages to-awake emotions in people. \"Coming face to face with a mechanical human has always been a disconcerting experience. Over the centuries, each generation has experienced this afresh as new waves of technology heralded its own curiosity-inducing robots. That sense of unease, of something you cannot quite put your finger on, goes to the heart of our long relationship with robots,\" said Ben Russell, lead curator of \"Robots.\" A growing sense of unease With some exceptions like C-3PO and R2-D2 in \"Star Wars,\" robots are predominantly portrayed in movies as threatening figures. Now Hollywood is not the only one to envision them taking over the world: Even the world-renowned physicist Stephen Hawking has warned that \"the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.\"- The satirical sci-fi classic \"RoboCop\" (1987) depicted one of the most iconic robots in film history Developing incredibly quickly, advanced intelligence comes with a series of social, philosophical and economic implications. Do the risks outweigh the opportunities? The exhibition also tries to answer such questions, with discussions such as \"When will robots outsmart us?\" and reflections on \"What it means to be human.\" The London show runs from February 8 to September 3, 2017 and will spend the following five years touring different museums in the UK and around the world.

       " ['Top Ukraine separatist commander assassinated A top rebel commander in eastern Ukraine has been killed in what local authorities described as an assassination. Mikhail Tolstykh joins a string of other warlords killed in bombings in recent months. Mikhail Tolstykh, better known by his nom de guerre Givi, was killed in an apparent bombing at his office, local officials and media reported on Wednesday. The 35-year-old headed the \"Somali\" battalion and was a top commander in the self-declared Donetsk People\\'s Republic. He was a notorious and high-profile commander who took part in several key battles in the nearly 33-month conflict. The rebels\\' Donetsk News Agency said Tolstykh was assassinated in what it described as a terrorist attack. It said a rocket from a portable launcher struck the commander\\'s office early on Wednesday morning. Few additional details were released, but separatists blamed the government in Kyiv. Yuri Tandit, an adviser to the chairman of the Ukrainian Security Service in Kyiv, told 112 television channel that his agency was looking into the reports of the death. Several rebel commanders considered rivals to Moscow-backed separatist political leaders have been killed in bomb blasts away from the front lines. In October, a powerful Donetsk military chief, Arseny Pavlov, also known as \"Motorola,\"-was killed in a bombing. Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/2WxFV Moscow has reportedly tried to control unruly warlords who have gained too much local power and engaged in murder and other suspected crimes against civilians. The Ukrainian government has often cited such commanders it labels as terrorists as a reason to not negotiate. At the same time, the political leadership of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions has come to be dominated by bureaucrats tied to former pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, who are rivals of some of the rebel commanders on the ground. Some rebel commanders are considered more hardcore and less willing to negotiate with Kyiv than the pro-Russian political leadership in Donetsk and Luhansk. Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, said Wednesday that Tolstykh\\'s death was an attempt to destabilized eastern Ukraine after a recent uptick in violence between government forces and rebels that claimed more than 30 lives.- He said it was impossible to suggest Russia had any role in the bombing. Some 10,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands have been displaced since protesters ousted Yanukovych in early 2014, leading to Russia annexing Crimea and to the-separatist rebellion in the mostly ethnic Russian eastern Ukraine. cw/msh-(AFP, AP) -'],\n",
       " ['Boring tweets: Elon Musk teases followers with tunnel and Hyperloop pipe dreams A complaint, a promise, and then a photo? Celebrity inventor Elon Musk is slowly raising the curtain on an ambitious tunnel project, one that may have applications on Mars. But is it for real? Elon Musk has a lot of ideas, and it isn\\'t always clear whether he intends to make something real out of them. Hence the cautious enthusiasm surrounding a photo he posted to Twitter on February 4. It appears to show the interior of an industrial-sized drill used to bore tunnels. It resembles - but is not quite the same as - similar boring machines used for tunneling projects elsewhere. Examples include the German-built Gripper used for the Gotthard Base Tunnel in Switzerland and the \"Bertha\" mega-drill created for an ongoing smaller-scale project in the US city of Seattle. The image, which had not previously been posted to the internet, implies the founder of Tesla and SpaceX has taken a very concrete first step toward fulfilling a \"promise\" to build a tunnel under one of the world\\'s megacities, Los Angeles, population nearly four million. Later that day, as if to show proof-of-concept, he tweeted a second picture of a Washington DC tunnel.  Musk has mentioned tunnels before as a theoretical solution to traffic problems plaguing the major cities of the world. But it took a moment of apparent frustration in December 2016 for him to commit himself online to the concept. But the \"promise\" remained just that - until late January, when Musk appeared to commit to actual drilling in a Saturday morning tweet. When one of his followers asked \"Where will your tunnel be?\" Musk responded with the following: \"Starting across from my desk at SpaceX. Crenshaw and the 105 Freeway, which is 5 mins from LAX\" The following week Musk told Wired magazine that, over the weekend, workers at SpaceX headquarters in LA had excavated a \"test trench\" roughly 30 feet wide (9.1 meters), 50 feet long and 15 feet deep. \"We\\'re just going to figure out what it takes to improve tunneling speed by, I think, somewhere between 500 and 1,000 percent,\" he said, also telling the magazine he ultimately envisions tunnels \"10, 20, 30 layers deep (or more).\" Musk added: \"We have no idea what we\\'re doing - I want to be clear about that.\" On his Twitter profile, the inventor/investor now describes his professional interests as follows: Tesla, SpaceX, Tunnels & OpenAI. The obvious omission seems to be Hyperloop, the near-vacuum tube allowing magnetic trains to reach theoretical speeds of 1,200 kilometers per hour (760 miles per hour). The omission leaves me wondering, however. To what extent is the Hyperloop concept dependent on \"tunnels,\" and could the Hyperloop in turn become a subcategory of them. Musk says it will be necessary to bore tunnels to make Hyperloop feasible, even if most Hyperloop conceptual art shows the dual vacuum tubes supported on pylons above the ground. He has hinted as much on Twitter. Finally, with regard to SpaceX and the colonization of Mars, one idea that\\'s been floated is whether tunneling underground on the Red Planet would help protect astronauts from radiation and extreme cold. So perhaps the technologies tested in LA should not be viewed as an isolated idea or project, but rather as just one more component in Elon Musk\\'s comprehensive and ever-expanding vision of human travel and exploration.'],\n",

He also reveals the event he\\'s most looking forward to. A lot has happened around the world since the last festival - including last year\\'s jury president Meryl Streep being called the \"most overrated actress in Hollywood\" by the new US president.-Does the program reflect new political realities? Dieter Kossslick: First of all, I\\'d say it\\'s rather-the most overrated president in history-and not the most overrated actress - but that\\'s another story\"?Yes, we have a lot of films reflecting today\\'s world, such as exploitation in Africa, or colonialism, which still happens in the Antarctic. There are films about Brazil, where big companies - called-\"investors\" - are now exploiting the country. So we have all these films dealing with developments that have been taking place over the last few years. Of course-filmmakers have been tackling these topics. And now there\\'s more focus on such issues, with the arrival of a new president who\\'s in favor of the old world, of so-called fossil capitalism. Biopics play a big role this year... The opening film is a musical biopic on Django Reinhardt, one of the world\\'s most famous gypsy and swing guitarists. The young Karl Marx (right), hanging out with Friedrich Engels We also have a biopic on the famous Swiss artist Giacometti, portrayed by Geoffrey Rush-in an incredible performance-and directed by Stanley Tucci. And we have \"The Young Karl Marx,\" directed by Raoul Peck. He describes Marx as a young, wonderful guy stumbling around today\\'s Soho, having some drinks with his friend Engels and thinking about Manchester\\'s capitalism and writing the big book, \"Das Kapital.\" The film is right on time, because even newspapers like \"Die Zeit\" in Germany just wrote: \"Was-Karl Marx-right?\" Yes, Karl Marx was right. The capitalist system didn\\'t make the poor people rich; it only makes the rich people richer. The communist system unfortunately didn\\'t work either - but Marx had foreseen the whole thing. One of the things I most look forward to every year is the Berlinale looking back. This year\\'s retrospective is called \"Future Imperfect. Science - Fiction - Film,\" and offers mostly bleak visions of the future. Looking back allows us to see the future or to see the reality we are living in: This is interesting because someone who just took-the time and only saw these films during the Berlinale would also recognize today\\'s reality, because science-fiction filmmakers had fantasies which, unfortunately,-in some cases, are now realities. What are you personally most looking forward to? As every year, I\\'m looking forward to the opening night. With 3,500 people sitting there watching a film. I hope they\\'ll like it! -- The 67th Berlin International Film Festival (February 9-19, 2017) opens with a musical biopic. The debut film of French director Etienne Comar tells the story of the legendary jazz and swing musician, Django Reinhardt. There are 18 films competing this year for the festival\\'s top awards. Three German works are on the list, including Volker Schl?ndorff\\'s \"Return to Montauk,\" starring Nina Hoss (pictured). There are also six German co-productions in the run. Another German highlight is \"Beuys,\" a documentary about famous German artist Joseph Beuys. Director Andres Veiel is known for his films dealing with political and social issues. His latest documentary is vying for the Golden Bear, going up against feature films. The directorial debut of the actor Josef Hader, the dark comedy \"Wild Mouse,\" is bound to become an audience\\'s favorite among the competing films. Hader\\'s performance in the lead role in \"Stefan Zweig: Farewell to Europe\" (2016) was critically acclaimed. This British dark comedy is also one of the headliners of the festival. \"T2 Trainspotting\" is the sequel to the cult drug trip directed by Danny Boyle in 1996 and stars the original cast, 20 years later. \"T2\" will screen out of competition. Feature films are set against documentaries and animated films in the Berlinale competition. The Chinese animated feature \"Have a Nice Day,\" by Liu Jian, tells a gangster story. The festival\\'s section called Forum includes 43 films this year, including documentaries and several feature films, such as \"Barrage.\" This French production deals with the relationship between three generations of women in a family. The program of the section Panorama is once again colorful and diverse: It would be impossible to find just one overarching theme to define it, though Panorama traditionally features many films about homosexuality. Jochen Hick\\'s documentary \"My Wonderful West Berlin,\" about the campaigns of the gay community in the 1980s, is one of them this year. Beyond the traditional sections of the program, the Berlinale Special series highlights recent works by contemporary filmmakers. Among them is the film \"The Young Karl Marx,\" depicting Marx (August Diehl, right) and Friedrich Engels (Stefan Konarske). The film was directed by Haitian-born filmmaker Raoul Peck. In 2015, the Ukrainian filmmaker and activist Oleg Sentsov went on trial in Russia, accused of \"plotting terrorist acts.\" Human rights observers described it as a politically motivated case. Despite strong international solidarity with Sentsov, he was sentenced to 20 years in a Siberian prison. The documentary \"The Trial: The State of Russia vs Oleg Sentsov\" is being shown during the Berlinale. Through 14 shorter and longer films, the upcoming generation of German filmmakers is featured in the series Perspektive Deutsches Kino (Perspective on German cinema). One of the most original titles is certainly \"Self-Criticism of a Bourgeois Dog,\" by Julian Radlmaier. The Generation series aims to attract younger movie-goers to the festival. The German-Italian co-production \"Mountain Miracle - An Unexpected Friendship\" tells the story of a 15-year-old girl called Amelie, who suffers from life-threatening asthma, but decides to run away from her doctors and concerned friends and family. The section Culinary Cinema presents films dealing with nutrition, ecology, agriculture and haute cuisine. The documentary \"At the Fork\" explores how farm animals are raised for our consumption. Going beyond the usual clich¨¦s on the topic, the film introduces viewers to real people: America\\'s farmers, grappling with the moral issues of their work. Films are not only made by actors, directors, producers and cinematographers. This is what this year\\'s Honorary Golden Bear aims to underline by paying tribute to the work of the Italian costume designer Milena Canonero. The winner of four Oscars has often worked with Stanley Kubrick, but she also designed the costumes on Sofia Coppola\\'s \"Marie Antoinette.\" This year\\'s Retrospective section looks back at the past to show cinema\\'s vision of the future. Among the most original works to be featured is \"Warning from Space\" (1956) by Japanese director KÅ\\x8dji Shima. Festival-goers won\\'t need to wear their warmest clothes to face the frost, thanks to the Berlinale section NATIVe. It focuses this year on indigenous cinema from the Arctic. The film \"Angry Inuk\" by Alethea Arnaquq-Baril provides insight into the consequences of the seal hunting debate for the Inuits of the North of Canada. Those fearing a zombie apocalypse might prefer to avoid George A. Romero\\'s \"Night of the Living Dead.\" A restored version of the cult film from 1968 is to be screened in the section Berlinale Classics, along with other masterpieces of film history. Throughout the week\\'s series of workshops held at the Berlin theater Hau Hebbel am Ufer, some 250 young talents from 71 countries will be networking with professionals in the film industry. This year\\'s focus, \"Courage: Against All Odds,\" will lead them to discuss fearlessness in an increasingly challenging film industry. Author: Jochen K¨¹rten (eg)'],\n",
       " ['How the Berlinale is staying political by not talking about Trump The Berlinale\\'s opening fim, \"Django,\" examines how artists response to totalitarianism. The head of Germany\\'s largest film festival says he doesn\\'t want to talk about Trump - but the film lineup speaks for itself. Berlinale director Dieter Kosslick has made it clear that he doesn\\'t want to dedicate his film event to the one topic that has already dominated headlines in recent week: US President Donald Trump. - The Berlinale, which opens Thursday and runs through February 19, has always been seen as a decidedly political festival, so many are expecting Trump to be a hot-button issue over the next 10 days. But Kosslick and his team want to avoid that. -- Berlinale director: \\'Our program is enough is a protest\\' Trump\\'s name wasn\\'t even mentioned at the festival\\'s opening press conference. \"Our program is enough of a protest,\" Kosslick stated. Indeed, many films on the lineup have to do with politics and human rights, social upheavals and the consequences of globalization. These films don\\'t shy away from making clear statements against exclusion and hatred. This can already be observed in the opening film. In his debut film, \"Django,\"-French director Etienne Comar portrays the years the famous musician Django Reinhardt spent in Nazi-occupied Paris. Django Reinhardt, played by Reda Kateb (pictured above), is a star among the French and his fans love his gypsy swing. Reda Kateb (left) and C¨¦cile de France in \"Django\" However, the Nazis are persecuting members of his ethnic group, the Sintis, and deporting them to concentration camps. For a while, the musician is protected by his own popularity, but when the Nazis demand that he goes on tour in Germany, Django Reinhardt is forced to make a very difficult decision. \\'Django\\' one of many films about artists It features an artist that belongs to a minority group and suffers from state-led repression: \"Django\" deals with a classic conflict that can be interpreted as a reference to contemporary social problems in many parts of the world, including in Trump\\'s America. Social conflicts will be the focus of many films on the agenda and are likely to dominate discussions and press conferences during the festival. At this year\\'s Berlinale, 18 works will be competing for Golden and Silver Bears. German film is once again strongly represented with Volker Schl?ndorff, Thomas Arslan and Andres Veiel, and is also likely to trigger many debates over the next 10 days. \"Back for Good\" is a work by young filmmaker Mia Spengler \"Perspektive Deutsches Kino,\" a special series devoted to young filmmakers will open with \"Back for Good\" by Mia Spengler. The work shows yet another aspect of film - private worlds - by following a mother and her two daughters as they face various crises and conflicts. Circumcision in South Africa, drugs in Canada Of course, Germany\\'s largest film festival, which bills itself as \"the world\\'s biggest viewers\\' festival,\"-also presents international films both in and out of competition. The section \"Panorama,\" for example, is opened by a film from South Africa. In \"The Wound,\" director John Trengove looks at the circumcision rites of the Xhosa ethnic group, while his protagonists travel through a world characterized by machismo and aggression and by tension between tradition and modernity. The film focuses on discrimination against homosexuals in a society dominated by manhood rituals. \"The Wound\" looks at the circumcision rites of the Xhosa in South Africa In addition to the competition and \"Panorama,\" the \"Forum\" is one of the Berlinale\\'s largest sections. This year, its 47th edition will be opened by a Canadian film. \"Werewolf\" by Canadian filmmaker Ashley McKenzie portrays the struggle of a young couple trying to liberate itself from the calamitous cycle of drugs and crime. \"Werewolf\" is about young people living in a 21-century excess, caught between pessimism and hope - issues that are likely to come up in other festival contributions as well.- Robert Pattinson, Pen¨¦lope Cruz expected Berlinale visitors can look forward to other sections such as \"Generation,\" \"Retrospektive,\" \"Kulinarisches Kino\" and \"NATIVe.\" As they do every year, film buyers and distributors will meet at the European Film Market, which has been growing steadily over the years. Future directors can hope for some useful advice from professional directors and artists from other fields, including Bulgarian-American installation star Christo. As far as the glamour factor goes, the Berlinale can\\'t quite compare with Cannes, but a long list of top stars are expected nevertheless: Pen¨¦lope Cruz, Catherine Deneuve, Kristin Scott Thomas, Laura Linney, Richard Gere, Ethan Hawke, Robert Pattinson, Geoffrey Rush, and Hugh Jackman - to name a few. This year, the jury is headed by Dutch director Paul Verhoeven, who is a well-known name in Hollywood (\"Robocop,\" \"Total Recall,\" \"Basic Instinct\"). He\\'s the one who gets to announce \"The Golden Bear goes to\"? on Saturday'],\n",

Jack Nicholson is expected to star in the English-language version of the acclaimed German film \"Toni Erdmann,\" according to a report published Tuesday-by trade magazine \"Variety.\" The 79-year-old star was thought to have-retired from film acting; his last appearance in a movie went back to 2010, in James L Brooks\\' \"How Do You Know.\" Even though it did not win the Palme d\\'Or, Maren Ade\\'s \"Toni Erdmann\" obtained unusual critical acclaim at the Cannes film festival in 2016. The film didn\\'t win at the Golden Globes either, but an Oscar as best foreign film on February 26 is still a possibility, as it is among the five nominees in the category.- Imagine Jack Nicholson and Kristen Wiig instead: Peter Simonischek and Sandra H¨¹ller in the original version The bittersweet comedy tells the story of a father whose life has been characterized by a series of cheap pranks and who tries to reconnect with his career-focused daughter. Jack Nicholson would take on the father\\'s role with Kristen Wiig as-the daughter. But why a remake? Fans of the German film might find the idea of remaking it questionable. However, the trend is not new: Since American movie audiences don\\'t seem to like subtitles or dubbing, Hollywood often remakes successful foreign movies. \"Three Men and a Baby\" from 1987 was based on a French film, while \"Scent-of a Woman\" (1992) originally came from Italy. \"The Birdcage\" (1996) also had a French role model, while \"Interview\" (2007) stemmed from The Netherlands.- The German comedy-drama \"Toni Erdmann\" is also notoriously long - 162 minutes - making it an unusual format for the US. According to \"Variety,\" Nicholson was so thrilled by the original that it was his own idea to get \"Toni Erdmann\" remade. The author and director of the original had already been asked about a possible remake in 2016: \"We\\'ve had interest but I have to think about it. It depends. There are so many things remade. I don\\'t feel the need that it\\'s remade but it depends on the conditions. Everybody has his price,\" Maren Ade told news agency Associated Press. Her conditions appear to have been fulfilled; Ade is also attached to the project as executive producer. No director has been named yet. eg/kbm (AP, dpa)'],\n",

China operated a program under which many transplanted organs came from executed persons. At a Vatican conference on organ trafficking, China\\'s top official on transplantation said on Tuesday that-the country was working on improving the way it handled organ transplants. \"China is mending its ways and constantly improving its national organ donation and transplantation systems,\" said Dr. Huang Jiefu, the director of China\\'s transplant program. China has been strongly criticized for harvesting organs from executed prisoners. Huang first publicly acknowledged the program in 2005, and later revealed that up to 90 percent of organ transplants from deceased donors were from executed people. While the practice was-officially ended in 2015, it is unclear whether China actually stopped the program. Dr. Haibo Wang, a colleague of Huang\\'s, said it was impossible to fully oversee transplants in China with a million medical centers and three million doctors operating in the country. In response, Dr. Jacob Lavee, president of Israel\\'s transplant society, said the World Health Organization (WHO) should be allowed to conduct unannounced inspections and interview donors in China. \"As long as there is no accountability for what took place\"¦there can be no guarantee for ethical reform,\" said Lavee. Huang countered by saying there were dozens of arrests and 18 medical institutions had been closed. He added that the reforms were still new and required patience. \"China\\'s transplantation reform has been an arduous journey,\" said Huang. \"As long as we move ahead, China will be the largest country for organ transplants in an undisputed ethical way in a few years.\" Unwelcome guests The advocacy group Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting (DAFOH) criticized the Vatican for inviting guests from China, saying the goals of the conference would be compromised by their attendance \"if China is allowed back into the community of nations without providing evidence that it has truly abandoned its cruel and illegal practice of forcibly harvesting organs.\"- Other critics sent a letter to Pope Francis saying the Chinese attendance amounted to whitewashing its previous practices. However, the Vatican stood firm its decision, saying it could encourage reform in the country. \"Are they doing any illegal transplantation of organs in China? We can\\'t say. But we want to strengthen the movement for change,\" said chancellor of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences Monsignor Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo. kbd/jm (AP, Reuters)'],\n",

They were joined in the last eight by Bayern Munich and Borussia M?nchengladbach. Hamburg 2-0 Cologne (Jung 5', Wood 76') Hamburg scored a goal in each half to dump Cologne out of the German Cup and reach the last eight. Gideon Jung gave the three-time champions a dream start with a close-range finish inside five minutes, and Cologne never recovered. Hamburg, liberated from their Bundesliga struggles in the Cup, doubled their lead 14 minutes from the end through Bobby Wood, whose low finish nestled in the bottom corner.  Arminia Bielefeld's Stephan Salgar converted the crucial penalty to send them through Astoria Walldorf 1-1 Arminia Bielefeld (Bielefeld won 5-4 on pens) (Carl 78'- Sch¨¹tz 52') Arminia Bielefeld sneaked into the quarter-finals with a penalty shootout victory over fourth-tier Astoria Walldorf. Bielefeld took the lead through Tom Sch¨¹tz and seemed on course for a slender victory, but-Marcel Carl's opportunistic header for Walldorf leveled the tie and forced extra time. Walldorf held on through extra time to force a shootout, but Nicolai Gross and Jonas Kiermeier missed their penalties, allowing Arminia's Stephan Salger to score the winning penalty to send the second-tier side through.  Douglas Costa celebrates his deflected shot, which proved the winner for Bayern Bayern Munich 1-0 Wolfsburg (Costa 17') Douglas Costa's deflected first-half shot gave defending champions Bayern a narrow 1-0 win over a dogged Wolfsburg side.

As temperatures soar and rainfall drops, vital lakes are drying up. We take a look at some of the most startling vanishing acts. Lake Poop¨® Empty fishing boats sit on the cracked, scorched floor of -Bolivia\\'s once mighty Lake Poop¨®. The lake has been on a continuous decline for years, but at the beginning of 2016, it dried up almost completely, spelling disaster for wildlife and families dependent on it for fishing. The lake has always been shallow and subject to fluctuation. But scientists believe this time it may not recover. Climate change is part of the problem. Rainfall has steadily decreased and temperatures have increased by 2 degrees Celsius over the last three decades, a factor worsened by El Nino, say scientists. But this is also a man-made disaster. Water from the river feeding the lake is diverted for agriculture, as well as silver and tin mines in the region. Lake Chad Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/2WM1R Lake Chad was once one of the largest lakes in the world. For centuries, it\\'s been a vital source of food and water for the surrounding communities. But it\\'s vanishing at an astonishing rate. Since the 1960s, decreased from around 25,000 square kilometers to 1,350 square kilometers, which is equivalent to a country roughly the size of-Belize in South America disappearing. It is now a patchwork of weeds, ponds and islands. What was once fertile land around the lake is now dust. Agriculture-and fish stocks have collapsed. Around 30 million people in countries, including Chad, Cameroon, Niger and Nigeria, depend on these waters and the lake\\'s vanishing act has plunged the basin into -a food and malnourishment crisis \"on an epic scale,\" according to aid agencies. - Large and unsustainable irrigation projects, diverting water from the lake and the Chari and Logone rivers are part of the problem. Between 1983 and 1994, irrigation in the area had increased four-fold, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. But soaring temperatures and decreased rainfall due to climate change are to blame too. The Dead Sea Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/2Sj0Z The Dead Sea is a lake fed by the River Jordan and though it has no connection to the ocean, it is so salty that nothing but microbes can survive there. It\\'s also a favorite with bathers and holidaymakers who visit the area, which borders Israel, the West Bank and Jordan, for its curative properties and to float effortlessly on its surface. The lake has survived for thousands of years because the water evaporating from it and flowing into it has remained relatively stable. But that equilibrium has been disturbed with the growth of the region\\'s population. Water is now being diverted to supply people\\'s homes and also for use in the water-intensive potash and chemical sector. It\\'s now declining by around a meter a year-and could disappear completely if measures are not taken. Aral Sea Rusting hulks rise up out of the sand as ghostly monuments to what was once a lively and prosperous fishing port.

Now the Aral, which at one time was the world\\'s fourth largest lake, is over a hundred kilometes away, and the city\\'s thriving fishing and canning industry has collapsed.- The lake has been--steadily shrinking since the 1970s. Water that had flowed into the Aral-was diverted to irrigate Uzbekistan\\'s burgeoning cotton sector, as part of the Soviet plant to turn Central Asia into the world\\'s largest producer-of cotton. For-a time the country exported more cotton than anywhere else. But the diversion, along with hydropower plants and reservoirs, has taken its toll.

The already desperate situation for the world\\'s smallest porpoise, the vaquita, is getting even worse as the number of animals off Mexico\\'s shores continues to plummet. Now, scientists warn that only 30 animals are left, despite navy efforts to intercept fishing vessels illegally using gillnets. Gillnets are one of the main factors threatening the vaquita. \"At the current rate of loss, the vaquita will likely decline to extinction by 2022, unless the current gillnet ban is maintained and effectively enforced,\" says the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita (CIRVA). The scientists concluded that just 30 individuals remain after analyzing acoustic signals from the upper Gulf of California in northwestern Mexico. In a previous census at the end of 2015 they had found around 60 vaquitas. There were 200 of them in 2012 and 100 in 2014. The scientists have announced what could be a last-ditch effort to save the rare species by capturing specimens and putting them in an enclosure in the Gulf of California, allowing them an opportunity to reproduce. Some environmentalists oppose this approach and point to the risk of vaquitas dying in the process, as DW has previously reported. But authorities and other environmentalists say the vaquitas have been dying for years in gillnets that are meant to illegally catch another endangered species, a large fish called the totoaba . The totoaba\\'s dried swim bladder is often shipped to China, where it fetches tens of thousands of dollars and is eaten in soup. CIRVA member Lorenzo Rojas-Bracho told AFP that scientists would attempt to catch vaquitas around October. \"Illegal fishing continues and if we don\\'t capture them, they will die anyway,\" he said. afp/ke -'],\n",
       " ['World Bank accused of financing fossil fuel development A new report says the World Bank\\'s Development Policy Financing programs continue to subsidize builders of coal, oil and gas projects - going directly against its own proclaimed low-carbon and pro-climate policies. A new report has accused the World Bank of continuing to fund fossil fuel-projects on a massive scale while simultaneously claiming to prioritize efforts to finance the shift to a low-carbon, climate-protected future. \"The World Bank has pledged to help countries adopt a low-carbon development path, specifically by phasing out fossil fuel subsidies and promoting a carbon tax,\"?said Nezir Sinani, Europe and Central Asia Manager at the Bank Information Center (BIC), a Washington-based watchdog group. \"However, the bank\\'s policy lending does the opposite, by introducing tax breaks for coal power plants and coal export infrastructure,\" said Sinani. The study, released Friday (27.01.2017), focuses on the World Bank\\'s Development Policy Financing (DPF) program, which accounts for about a third of all World Bank funding. The program extends financial support to borrowing governments in the developing world as a financial reward for adopting specific policies approved by the bank. The BIC report, which examines seven World Bank policy operations from 2007 to 2016 totaling $5 billion in four countries - Indonesia, Peru, Egypt and Mozambique - revealed that \"DPF-linked funds intended to boost low-carbon growth are instead supporting investment incentives for projects that put the climate, forests and people at risk.\" The coal industry continues in countries around the world, including China Saying one thing, doing another? \"We need a global financial system that\\'s fit for purpose to factor in climate risks and opportunities,\" World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim said in November 2016, as the Paris climate change agreement came into force. \"Ending extreme poverty and fighting climate change are inextricably linked. We cannot do one without the other,\" Jim Yong Kim had said. But the new findings indicate that the World Bank is providing extensive and ongoing support for major coal, oil and gas projects. \"World Bank policy loans are creating subsidies for coal, gas and oil projects and undercutting initiatives to build wind, solar and geothermal power infrastructure and protect vulnerable rainforests - including the Amazon,\" BIC said. DW was unable to get through to the World Bank for comment. But the World Bank has apparently disputed the report\\'s findings, which \"grossly misrepresent the World Bank\\'s engagement in these countries,\" a spokesperson for the World Bank told BBC News. Oil and gas projects like this one in Brazil push into the heart of remaining rainforests, bringing roads and illegal logging Key findings In Peru, DPF apparently supported initiatives extended subsidies to public-private partnerships for a liquid petroleum gas pipeline, three natural gas pipeline networks, and 26 new oil-and-gas drilling concessions. There was some support for hydropower, but none for solar or wind projects. In Indonesia, DPF established subsidies for public-private partnerships on fossil fuel infrastructure projects, including four coal power plants and three coal transport railways on the islands of Kalimantan and Sumatra - and no geothermal, solar or wind public-private partnerships projects are in the works. In Egypt, planned infrastructure projects with World Bank DPF-supported subsidies include more than a dozen oil and gas projects, new coal power plants with generating capacity of 12.5 gigawatts, and 12 pending oil and gas exploration agreements. In Mozambique, DPF-supported subsidies will benefit four coal power plants, three coal port terminals, two coal transport railways, and a natural gas plant. One hydropower plant is due for support, but no geothermal, solar or wind projects are targeted by the subsidies. Sinani expressed special concern over Mozambique\\'s accelerated rate of oil and gas exploration, due to its potential to significantly reduce tax rates. \"Such tax reductions are the opposite of a carbon tax, which the Bank purports to support.\" Collaborating on the report were Derechos, Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (DAR) Peru, Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR), Greenpeace Indonesia, Friends of the Earth Mozambique, and 11.11.11 Belgium. The World Bank extended $3.05 billion in World Bank funding for the Medupi Power Station in South Africa in 2010 Keeping it in the ground Scientists have developed a \"carbon clock\" showing cumulative emissions of carbon since the fossil-fuels era began, to demonstrate-how little room there is left in the atmosphere for dumping still more carbon. According to 2014 research, more than 80 percent of the world\\'s known coal reserves, 50 percent of natural gas reserves, and 30 percent of oil reserves need to stay in the ground in order to attain a chance at staying under 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) warming - a goal to which global society agreed in the Paris Agreement. Closing down coal-powered electricity generation worldwide as soon as possible is the single most important priority for climate stability, climate protection advocates say. The Paris Agreement even committed participating nations to trying to prevent average global temperature rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, which would require extremely ambitious year-on-year reductions in carbon emissions - starting now. BIC\\'s Sinani underscored this, saying: \"The climate crisis and staying under 2 degrees Celsius warming not only requires increasing investments in renewable energy, but also drastically decreasing fossil fuel investments.\" The BIC report calls on the World Bank to support incentives for more renewable energy through DPFs, and to make \"more rigorous climate- and forest-related assessments of DPFs before they are approved,\" Sinani said. A key challenge for climate protection is financing renewable energy infrastructure in developing countries The World Bank, in its rebuttal, cited broad energy work involving a mix of interventions that \"work together to promote climate smart growth and increased energy access.\" Sinani concluded that BIC\\'s call has resonated with several World Bank executive directors.'],\n",

Velayati said Iran\\'s policies in the Middle East would not change, \"therefore [President Donald] Trump and the American administration must get their stuff together and leave this region completely because the people of this region feel alienated by their policies\". Velayati said the US effort to make Iran stop its missile programme with military threats amounted to \"worthless fantasies\". \"Without the slightest doubt, I can guarantee you that we will continue to develop our military programmes, and especially our defence missile programme, no matter what and at any cost,\" he said. \"We do not have any worry about the US threats because America for the last 38 years after the Islamic revolution has not been able to do anything.\" Relations between the US and Iran have deteriorated since Trump took office on January 20, promising a more aggressive line on what he views as Iranian belligerence towards US interests and allies. Last week Michael Flynn,-US national security adviser,-accused Iran of violating a UN Security Council resolution which calls on Iran not to test missiles capable of delivering a nuclear weapon. Iran has confirmed it tested a ballistic missile, but denied it was a breach of a 2015 nuclear deal with world powers or UN resolutions. Trump said Iran was \"playing with fire\"-after the country dismissed his warnings over the missile test as unfounded and provocative.

Not me!\" Trump said. Asked by a reporter if military action was a possibility, Trump said: \"Nothing is off the table\". The US later imposed sanctions on-13 Iranians and 12 companies.

       " ['Voices from the border: Opposing Trump\\'s wall Samuel Gilbert Americans living close to the Mexico border voice opposition to policies that falsely conflate immigration and security. By On Wednesday, John F Kelly, the head of the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the department tasked with implementing President Donald Trump\\'s immigration policy, laid out the administration\\'s vision before Congress. It included increasing vetting procedures for foreign nationals and, most pressingly, according to the newly appointed Kelly, fixing the \"gaping wound\" he considers to be the US-Mexico border. \"The security challenges facing DHS and our nation are considerable, particularly along the southern border,\" said Kelly, a former head of the US forces in Latin America. OPINION: What\\'s behind the Great Wall of America? The retired four-star Marine General framed the issue of immigration and the US-Mexico border as the foremost national security issue. \"Our vigorous response to these threats must include increased border security infrastructure, personnel, and technology,\" said Kelly, in line with Trump\\'s directives to boost border security, open new detention centres, and authorise state and local law enforcement officers to act as immigration officers. Referring to the support for Trump\\'s policies within the Republican-dominated House, Congressman Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House Committee of Homeland Security, said: \"I think for the first time we have the political will to get something done.\" Another Republican Congressman, Scott Perry, spoke of \"less secure\" borders during the previous administration. \"\"?Immigration agents could literally be fired for enforcing immigration laws,\" he said. But the claim that the Obama administration was soft on immigrants is far from true. Nearly 2.5 million people were deported between 2005 and 2015. Obama expanded immigration enforcement personnel and deported more undocumented immigrants than any other administration in history. OPINION: Mexico needs to stop accommodating Trump Voices from the border The rhetoric from the GOP and the new administration on immigrants have heightened concerns - long held by border residents and rights activists - about the effect of the proposed increased militarisation of their communities and continuation of an immigration policy that is viewed almost entirely through the lens of national security. \"That narrative that the borderlands are out of control, that it\\'s a national security threat, that the only way to address the border question is through military might, is both shameful and misguided,\" said Christian Ramirez, the director of the Southern Border Communities Coalition (SBCC). \"We believe in security. But the biggest concern is that security cannot come at the expense of people\\'s dignity and rights,\" said Ramirez, highlighting the proliferation of internal immigration checkpoints, mass surveillance and little oversight or accountability for immigration enforcement officials. \"Living in border communities, we see the border wall to be as much a signal of racial and ethnic bias against our communities as it is an infrastructure policy,\" said Brian Erickson, a border policy strategist at the American Civil Liberties Union. He sad that the \"aggressive policing agenda will result in widespread civil rights violations, dragnet surveillance and harassment of border residents\". Erickson pointed towards the legacy of abuses by law enforcement within the 100-mile border zone, where immigration enforcement officials are given extraordinary powers to search, detain and operate checkpoints. SBCC, along with the American Immigration Council, organised a telephonic briefing of \"borderland stakeholders\" a day before the DHS hearing to raise the voices of those most affected by these policies. It included people from each of the southern border states. One of them was a border patrol checkpoint expert named Jorge Rodriguez, who has lived his whole life in the 100-mile border zone and says he has had his daily life affeccted by the extraordinary powers granted to Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the largest police force in the nation. \"As a young Mexican-American male I am suspicious. I don\\'t have the ability to be unsuspicious. I exist as a marked body,\" said Rodriguez, who says he has experienced harassment and racial profiling since he was a student. \"How useful are rights if exercising them leads to abuse?\" he asked, addressing the teleconference. The experiences described by Rodriguez are born out of the extra-constitutional powers given to CBP, a law enforcement agency that Trump\\'s executive order proposes to expand by 5,000 agents. The Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution protects Americans from random and arbitrary stops and searches. But border patrol - unlike all other law enforcement agencies - has the \"the authority to interrogate anyone they think are aliens, search any vehicles in the 100-mile [zone], and within 25 miles of [the] border they are able to enter on to private property all without a warrant or even reasonable suspicion,\" said Andrea Guerrero, the executive director of Alliance San Diego in California and co-chair of the Southern Border Communities Coalition. Lived realities The purpose of the teleconference, according to Ramirez, was to highlight these lived realities and provide the perspectives that are rarely taken into account by policymakers in Washington DC. He said roughly $20bn is spent on border enforcement each year, even as the border communities most affected remain some of the poorest in the nation. \"These realities are rarely mentioned on Capitol Hill [the seat of US power].\" While the Republican-led committee largely voiced support for Trump\\'s executive orders, there were a few at the hearing who countered the rhetoric on immigration. \"You call it the gaping wound,\" said Congressman Jose Luis \"Lou\" Correa, the California representative, referring to Kelly\\'s statement. \"[But] right now immigration from Mexico is at all-time lows.\" The number of people living illegally in the country has dropped below 2005 levels, he added. Others questioned the representation of immigrants and of border communities as places of violence and crime - claims made by a number of congressmen during the hearing and throughout Trump\\'s election campaign. \"The claims of lawlessness and rampant violence in our border communities is just wrong,\" said Eddie Trevino, a county judge from Texas and a witness during the hearing\\'s second panel. \"It is nothing more than an attempt to paint it as something that it is not in order to support the misguided rhetoric against border communities, Mexican people and immigrants both legal and undocumented,\" said Trevino. \"The border wall concept is ineffective and creates a false sense of security,\" Trevino added. \"It is utilising a 14th-century solution to address a 21st-century problem.\" Conflating immigration and security- Unfazed by any criticism, the Trump administration has gone ahead with pushing immigration as a paramount security issue. \"One thing that Trump is effective at, is conflating refugees and immigration as above all else a national security issue,\" said Kevin Appleby of the New York-based Center for Migration Studies. \"These executive orders are using security as a smokescreen to simply reduce immigration and refugees and to justify mass deportation.\"  Source:-Al Jazeera News'],\n",
       " ['nan nan It\\'s always been far too easy for Americans to strut around the world\\'s living room praising our own inclusiveness ... acting very much as revisionist historians who, once past the obvious ugly, move along quickly to \"welcome\" the world\\'s hungry, tired and poor. The folly of attempting to rest the progress of a religious creed by persecutions and civil disabilities has been so often demonstrated that it is surprising to see it survived in this age and country. A distinguished advocate of religious liberty decreed, nearly a half-century ago, that even in Great Britain nearly all of its opponents had been silenced - some have been taught sense, others inspired with shame, until none were left upon the field except those that could neither learn nor blush. John Rutherford, Chairman Democratic Party Virginia, 1855 We are, in fact, quite accomplished in repackaging a dark, ugly history with fancy wrapping paper tied together with red, white and blue ribbons that seem to surface with predictable dramatic flair as Americans walk into voting booths. There\\'s not a whole lot of rewrite that can be done to sanitise the genocide of Native people or to recast slavery or reduce misogyny to anything but. These are, after all, the cornerstones upon which the United States was built. And the march from Asia to railroad peonage is littered with the bodies of indentured servants who typically found relief only in the opium that came with their forced labour as they built the passageway of the US from one coast to another. It\\'s a trail of tears that began long before the American Revolution and which continues on today as very much an open, oozing infection ... one described not all that long ago by our Supreme Court as \"badges and incidents of slavery\"-in a case which held that Congress had the authority to prohibit even private acts of ongoing discrimination. Likewise, the smug sermon of religious freedom and diversity that seems to find its way into every politician\\'s pulpit is belied by periods of religious persecution that not only predate the American Revolution but periodically stop to revisit us as so much a dark reminder of the wide chasm between blind faith and political reality. The \"non-violent\" part of the story is easy. It has its genesis, not long after the Revolutionary war, when varied states abolished some churches while supporting others, issued preaching licences and collected tax money to fund and establish official state churches. Were it just about \"peaceful\" institutional discrimination, it would be far easier to sell the tale of evolving cultural and religious diversity and freedom. But it\\'s not. Indeed, beginning in the 17th-century, anti-Quaker laws-imposed penalties upon \"heretics\" ranging from expulsion to capital punishment. In the 18th-century, physical assaults and near-drowning of Baptists-often became the cost of their beliefs. The 19th-century brought us torched convents, pitched gun battles between \"nativist\" Americans and mostly Irish Catholic immigrants, and a Mormon town burned to the ground with its leaders executed. In the 20th-century, Jews-became increasing targets of anti-religious fervour which ranged from imposition of immigration quotas based upon national origin to exclusion from colleges, to being banned from holding political office, and to violent attacks typically carried out by special societies such as the Silver Shirts or the Ku Klux Klan. In the early days of the 21st-century, reported anti-Muslim hate crimes soared nationwide from 28 to 481-and ran the gamut from racial and religious slurs to attacks on mosques and to physical assaults and murder. Ours is a political experience long rooted in theological and social animosity and domination; one where majority religious groups have long controlled domestic political power and opportunities that derive from its reach. Indeed, historically, theocratic rule has been quick to punish dissent within our midst and viewed immigrants with \"competing\" religious beliefs and values with suspicion as very much outsiders and undemocratic. INTERACTIVE: US Elections - Who got the right to vote when? So, one might ask, what is there, then, about the most recent Trump attack upon Muslims, all Muslims, that stands in dramatic contrast from a long and sordid American history of targeted persecutions of minorities based upon nothing more than religious and immigrant status? The easy part of the equation is it\\'s 2017 ... a long way removed from the time and place where we feared witches and hanged women. Indeed, one would like to think that in an \"enlightened\", educated, and culturally diverse \"advanced\" society, no president would dare to target men, women and children for exclusion or deportation from our shores on the basis of their place of birth, or belief, and nothing more. But Trump is not your run-of-the-mill president. He has made a career out of exploiting the fears of others to his personal benefit and, like the brash bully that he is, has perfected the art of the contemporary coliseum where today\\'s Roman elite decide the fate of the relatively powerless ... not with a thumbs-up or down but through immigration policies that play to the roar of the crowd ... a crowd long manipulated by ignorance and political greed which reduces 25 percent of the world\\'s population to presumptive enemy status by little more than the number of times that they pray each day. Is Donald Trump\\'s rhetoric, now executive policy, aberrant, or unique? Of course not. Tragically, nothing could be further from the truth. As noted, it is but another in a long history of legislative and political efforts to control the borders and street ways that, on the one hand, hold out the promise of freedom as an opportunity but, on the other, reduce it to little more than a tease based upon colour, class and religious belief. If the past is indeed a prelude, a passing look at just several of these failed attempts to homogenise the American experience offers much a glimpse of, ultimately, where and how Trump will fail in his effort to convert the US into a mirror image of his own insular and supremacist views and \"values\". In 1798 the Alien and Sedition Acts were a series of four laws proposed by the Federalist Party purportedly to increase \"national security\". In relevant part, these laws changed residency requirements for obtaining citizenship and gave the president power to imprison or deport aliens. The Acts themselves came about in response to American \"fears\" that unrest in Europe was starting to haemorrhage over into the US. The Federalists felt this turmoil was caused by immigrants who sympathised with the French Revolution and led people to believe that the Acts were necessary to eliminate foreign enemies residing in the US and to make America a safer place. Sound familiar? After the laws went into effect, the government began compiling a list of aliens that were to be deported. Many who were not incarcerated fled the country-on their own to avoid deportation or imprisonment. Following the implementation of the Act in 1798, future Presidents Thomas Jefferson and James Madison secretly drafted the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions which not only denounced the Alien and Sedition Acts as unconstitutional but prompted the first serious defence of the principles of states\\' rights. Not long thereafter, with the rise of public revulsion over the Acts, Jefferson was elected president. He immediately pardoned individuals who were still incarcerated for violating the Sedition Act and repaid the individuals\\' fines with government funds. More than 200 years later, some 15 states including Washington, Minnesota, Virginia, Massachusetts and New York, the District of Columbia along with more than 150 former US attorneys and assistant US attorneys from California, New York and Florida and some 100 US-based international companies now seek to strike down the Trump executive order which targets Muslims for exclusion or deportation from the US. These challenges derive their impetus from the very claims raised by Jefferson and Adams against the Alien and Sedition Acts, namely that states need not sit silent in the presence of unconstitutional federal attacks upon their citizens, visitors and refugees but can, in fact, seek relief in federal courts even against policies of the president normally found within the unique province of his power. One hundred and forty years later, the Alien and Sedition Acts laid the foundation for imprisoning so-called enemy aliens, namely Japanese Americans, and confiscating their property during World War II. As a result of Executive Order 9066 issued in 1942 by President Franklin Roosevelt, military commanders were empowered to designate \"military areas\" from which \"any and all persons [could] be excluded.\" More than 120,000 mostly second and third-generation Japanese Americans - many, Buddhists - were forcibly relocated from their homes mostly on the West Coast of the US and incarcerated in \"camps\" in the interior of the country. Although ordered not long after Japan\\'s attack on Pearl Harbor, there is little doubt that the forced relocation was triggered by political frenzy stirred by hate groups such as the Asiatic Exclusion League, the California Joint Immigration Committee and Native Sons of the Golden West which, along with various earlier Immigration Acts, had long targeted Japanese Americans and immigrants from other \"undesirable\" Asian countries as part of the \"yellow peril\". Although Roosevelt\\'s exclusion order was upheld by the Supreme Court on limited grounds, some 40 years later Congress passed the Civil Liberties Act which apologised for the internment and authorised reparations to each individual camp survivor. The legislation, which specifically acknowledged that government actions were based on \"race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership\", resulted in payments of more than $1.6bn to some 80,000 Japanese Americans who had been interned and their heirs. OPINION: Is this really how fascism takes hold in the US? These are just two of the most extreme examples of race and religious-based hate by the executive and legislative branches of the federal government that cover a 200-year period of US history. They are, however, by no means alien to the American experience which, throughout its run, has targeted immigrants and American citizens alike for no reason other than heritage, race or religion. From the Know-Nothing Movement of the 1850s, to the Palmer Raids of the 1920s, to the McCarthy era some three decades later, there are countless examples of when, like now, political animus has driven petty politicians and hate groups alike to target the most vulnerable among us. Hate is always senseless and, ultimately, self-defeating. It starts out with hating religious beliefs ... be they of Catholics, Jews, or Muslims ... and along the way sweeps within its dreadful destructive reach refugees from countries as diverse as Ireland, Italy, China, Palestine and Syria, to name a few. Hate unites the bonds of fear and ignorance for those who find perverse relief in the pain of others to make more palatable their own personal and political discomfort. Hate is a virulent malady indeed, one that seems to travel with the passage of time. Donald Trump is one such traveller.

       " ['More Americans joining socialist groups under Trump Patrick Strickland Socialist groups see huge spike in membership as they join protests against US President Donald Trump. By \\'The working class is hyper-exploited\\' Not entirely new \\'No mood to negotiate\\' Connor Southard had never been involved in political organising and had never been a member of a political organisation - until the election of the far-right US President, Donald Trump. After that he joined the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). \"As it became clear that the organised left was getting stronger and facing more formidable threats to its agenda ... it was clearly time to get involved,\" the 26-year-old writer from New York explained. The far-right in the United States - and in Europe - has been energised by Trump\\'s victory and his Republican Party\\'s firm grip on both chambers of Congress. \"The only way to oppose this level of the malignant power [of Donald Trump] is to get organised,\" Southard said. \"This moment is radicalising a lot of people due to the levels of outrage and disgust. People all over the country are asking what to do. The answer in one word is: Organise.\" He learned about the DSA from friends and Chapo Trap House, a popular left-wing satirical podcast. Since Trump\\'s electoral victory in November, socialist organisations have reported an explosion in membership and interest.   David Duhalde, the DSA\\'s deputy director, explains that the organisation\\'s membership has soared to 16,000, more than doubling since May 2016. In the last two weeks alone, more than 2,000 new members have registered.- \"We\\'re taking advantage of the rising energy around socialism and the popular feeling that capitalism is not working for the majority of people,\" he told Al Jazeera, adding that around 50 new chapters have been founded in communities and on campuses in recent months.- DSA members have participated in mass protests against Trump\\'s inauguration, supported the Women\\'s March, and called for the release of immigrants detained at airports owing to the new president\\'s ban on travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries.- \"It\\'s critical in our politics to promote coalition work and now to be part of a popular front against Trump,\" Duhalde explained. \"Socialists need to be in the masses of protests and doing solidarity work.\"- The Socialist Alternative, a Trotskyist party, said its membership has grown by more than 30 percent since Trump\\'s election.- The Socialist Party USA\\'s national secretary office said by email that they had also encountered \"a solid spike from right after the elections\", although they declined to provide further details. Although the numbers remain small when compared with Democratic and Republican Party membership, the growth has been significant. While fuelled by anger at Trump, the phenomenon hasn\\'t come entirely out of the blue. Connor Kilpatrick, a writer who sits on the editorial board of Jacobin, a New York-based socialist magazine, said the failures of both mainstream US parties have played a significant role in the rise of leftist politics. In addition to the failures of establishment Democrats and Republicans, Kilpatrick places a portion of the blame on the corporate media. His analysis is supported by the findings of a study by the mediaQuant analytics firm, which concluded that Trump had received an estimated $5bn worth of free media coverage. Just days after Trump\\'s electoral victory, nearly every mainstream US media outlet ran segments and feature stories about a conference by the National Policy Institute, in which around 100 people celebrated Trump\\'s win. During that conference, infamous white supremacist Richard Spencer led chants of \"Hail Trump!\" as the audience rose to its feet, making Nazi-like salutes. READ MORE: NYC Yemenis close bodegas to protest Trump travel ban That same night, around 450 people crowded into a small hall in Brooklyn to attend a talk about labour struggles hosted by Jacobin. \"It\\'s not like there aren\\'t socialist figures that the media could be shining their light on; they are making a decision not to,\" Kilpatrick said. Two days before the elections, in which Trump won the electoral college by a large margin but lost the popular vote, the Gravis Marketing research firm published a survey that examined how self-described socialist Bernie Sanders would have squared off against Trump. That survey found that Sanders would have beat Trump by a 56 to 44 percent margin. Sanders, a former independent who ran for the Democratic presidential slot and lost the primary to Clinton, is a US senator from Vermont. \"I think the working class is hyper-exploited and has been given nothing,\" Kilpatrick said, adding of Sanders: \"It says a lot that their favourite politician is a 75-year-old Jewish socialist.\" The American socialist movement has grown and shrunk in ebbs and flows since its inception. Eugene V Debbs, a socialist icon who ran for president five times, pulled in more than 900,000 votes during both the 1912 and 1920 elections. His Socialist Party of America\\'s membership peaked in 1912 at around 118,000 people.- But American socialism\\'s tumultuous history is punctuated with examples of state repression; the arrest of anti-war activists during World War I, the witch hunts led by Joseph McCarthy during the 1950s and the repression of students and other radicals during the New Left rebellion of the 1960s, among others. Although nationally they are weak today, an April 2016-study-by Harvard University found that 51 percent of millennials - a loosely defined group of people aged between 18 and 29 - reject capitalism and 33 percent support socialism.- Katie Feyh, a professor at Syracuse University who researches Marxism and rhetorical theory, argued that an already increasing interest in socialism was energised by the Sanders campaign. Sanders \"showed how hungry progressives and leftists have been for an electoral formation to the left of where the Democrats have been\" for decades, Feyh told Al Jazeera. The Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011 and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2014 attracted thousands of newcomers to progressive activism. In the 2012 presidential election, fewer than 18,000 people voted for socialist candidates, according to Latterly magazine. In November, the Green Party\\'s Jill Stein clinched nearly 1.5 million votes. Although not a socialist, Stein championed many left-wing causes. \"With record numbers marching against Trump, there are more people entering political activism outside the voting booth,\" Feyh explained. She added that, while socialists are \"far from the majority\" of those participating in demonstrations against Trump, \"there is an openness to [left-wing] politics that I haven\\'t seen in a long time\".- The American political process, while allowing for third parties, is in its essence a two-party system. From raising adequate funds to getting on ballots and securing sufficient media coverage, third parties face immense barriers.- While the mainstream consensus tends to blame third-party candidates for \"spoiling\" close elections, in a September 2015 Gallup poll, 60 percent of interviewees supported the establishment of a viable third party because the two main parties \"do such a poor job\".- Kshama Sawant, a member of the Socialist Alternative who sits on the Seattle City Council, said her party is organising and focusing on recruitment with the hope of carving out a spot on the national level.- Sawant, who took office in January 2014, was the first openly socialist politician to win a citywide election in Seattle in 97 years when she unseated four-term city councillor Richard Conlin.- Sawant said that the question of working with progressive elements within the Democratic Party is still a point of debate on the left.- While Sawant and the Socialist Alternative supported Bernie Sanders in the Democratic Party primary, they urged him to run as an independent candidate after he lost to Clinton. \"We were always completely open and honest that we don\\'t believe that the Democratic Party can be a political vehicle for putting forward a progressive agenda because its establishment leadership is so closely tied to Wall Street,\" she told Al Jazeera.- Sawant said Democrats have further alienated progressives by urging cooperation with Trump. Following the elections, Clinton offered to work with Trump and encouraged her supporters to keep an \"open mind\". A week after the elections, former President Barack Obama also said Americans should give Trump a chance.- Yet Sawant said most of the young people flocking to socialist groups are not willing to negotiate over Trump\\'s policies. \"There\\'s no mood to negotiate,\" she said. \"There\\'s a mood to fight back.\"- IN PICTURES: Washington DC - Women\\'s March for equal rights Thousands descended on airports in New York City, Chicago, Seattle, San Francisco and elsewhere as travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries were detained last week. As the protests spread, a court froze Trump\\'s ban on people from those countries entering the US until it can rule on its legality.- Sawant joined thousands of demonstrators at the Seattle-Tacoma airport. \"There were people who have never been at a protest before ... and we know that those sit-in actions and protests shutting down airports [across the US] were the principle drivers in the [freezing] of the ban.\" Last week, Trump signed a pair of executive orders scrapping several regulations placed on Wall Street. He has also vowed to build a wall along the US-Mexico border and to carry out mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, and has publicly stated his support for the use of torture.- Explaining that Trump\\'s far-right agenda has led many to join protests, Sawant argued that it is also a \"historic opportunity\" to introduce progressive politics to a broader audience.- \"We need to tie the demands for immigrants\\' rights to the demands of working people in general. It\\'s no longer going to be viable to simply play defence,\" she concluded.- \"The entire labour movement and everything we\\'ve fought for all these decades is on the chopping block right now.

       " ['West Bank: \\'One day on my land is worth a lifetime\\' Shatha Hammad Zena Tahhan A Palestinian landowner shares her story of loss and hope, as Israel legalises theft of private land by settlers. By By Silwad, Occupied West Bank - From a distance, Mariam Hammad, 83, stood with one of her grandchildren, observing the Amona outpost evacuation. As trucks shuttled between Amona and the nearby Israeli settlement of Ofra, Mariam remained skeptical, questioning whether the evacuation operations were serious. \"My heart will not rest until they remove the water tank,\" she said, pointing to the large water reservoir that was placed on the plot of land she inherited from her father in the Thahir al-Mazari\\' region, atop a rugged hill, northeast of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. Eight other families from nearby villages own plots in the same tract of land.- When Mariam arrived closer to the scene of evacuation, Israeli soldiers, who stood behind the concrete blocks, were on full alert. Fearless, Mariam stepped across the street to watch-what was happening on the land she had been forbidden from accessing for decades. With tearful eyes, Mariam recollected her memories of growing up on the land. \"I remember when I was a child, how I used to collect the stones and thorns from the ground and put them aside. My father would plough the field, while my mother planted the seeds,\" says Mariam. The land which her parents bought, she recalls, was non-arable at the time. \"They worked the land day and night until it became \\'one of the gardens of Silwad\\'\". If they offered me as much money as the number of grains of soil on my land, I will not accept. I want my land back - I don\\'t care about money. Mariam Hammad, Palestinian landowner As she grew up, Mariam grew more attached to the land. \"I cannot forget the taste of the water from the well in the field. It was as sweet as honey. I remember it very well and I wish I could return to taste it again.\" She recalls that her family used to follow one particular farming rule known as crop rotation - prohibiting the cultivation of the same crops for two consecutive seasons. \"One year we would plant wheat, vetch, barley and lentils. The next year we would grow tomatoes, cucumbers, watermelon, okra, and sunflowers.\" While her family owns a considerable amount of land in Silwad, the plot where Amona was built remained one of the most fertile, flourishing all year round, before it was taken over by settlers. On a summer day in the mid-1990s, Mariam and her husband, Mohammad, left their eight children at home to embark on their daily mission to collect the wheat they harvested on their land. \"A group of settlers came while we were working on the field. They began stepping on the crops and spoiling them. My husband tried to expel the settlers from the area,\" recalls Mariam, explaining that the confrontation had intensified and the settlers had tried to assault them, chanting, \"This land is ours - get out of here.\" Mariam recalls that, as they feared for their lives, her husband collected his harvesting tools, loaded them onto his horse, and they walked away from the land. \"As soon as we turned our backs and walked a little, the settlers set fire to the land. I ran back and gathered as many wheat stems as I could. I had a feeling that they would not let me enter my land after that day.\" That day-marked Mariam\\'s last visit to the land. \\'I want to pass on my land to my 30 children and grandchildren, who have a right to it,\\' said Mariam, with the Amona outpost, built on her land, in the distance behind her-[Shatha Hammad/ Al Jazeera] The next day, Mariam and her husband attempted to access the land, but they were stopped by settlers and Israeli soldiers at gunpoint, she recalled. Soon after, Mariam headed to the municipal council, armed with-title deeds and documents, to prove her ownership of the plot and demand justice, but to no avail. In the following days when Mariam and her husband attempted to approach the area, a woman from Ein Yabrud, a nearby village, identified as-Rutayba Abdul Kareem Jabra, was shot and killed as she walked towards Thahir al-Mazari\\', according to Mariam. \"She was carrying food on her head and was heading to the fields. As soon as she approached the area, the soldiers shot and killed her, before our eyes.\" The head of the Ein Yabrud municipal council confirmed the incident to Al Jazeera. - Under protection from the army, Israeli settlers remained on the land and built the outpost of Amona in 1997. They expanded and built 40 homes, infrastructure, and public facilities, while Mariam and the other landowners were forbidden from accessing their lands for decades. Today, after a long and hard battle in the courts with the help of Israeli human rights organisations, Mariam watches the evacuation and demolition of the outpost, which was once the largest in the West Bank, housing approximately 250 settlers.- Amona is one of about 100 Israeli \"outposts\" scattered across the occupied West Bank. Israel differentiates between outposts and settlements in that outposts were built without government authorisation. Both outposts and settlements, however, often involve seizing private Palestinian land-and are illegal under international law. In 2008, Israeli human rights organisation Yesh Din petitioned on behalf of Mariam and other landowners, demanding the removal of Amona. Three years ago, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that Amona in its entirety had been illegally built on stolen Palestinian land, and ordered it to be demolished. But as the evacuation enters its final stages, the Israeli government has passed a law that legalises theft of private Palestinian land by Israeli settlers in outposts, which could prevent future evacuations from taking place. The law will see Israel recognise 4,000 homes built by Jewish Israelis in the occupied West Bank as legal, provided the settlers could prove ignorance that they had built on privately owned land or under state orders. According to the law, the Palestinian landowners would be offered either money or an alternative plot of land, even if they refuse to give away their own property. Until today, Israeli settlers who lived in Amona-maintained-that the land was empty when they got there.-\"Arabs never lived there, it was a bare rocky mountain,\" one resident said in January.- Back in Silwad, the eldest of Mariam\\'s grandchildren, 20-year-old Abdulhamid Hammad, hugs his grandmother and kisses her forehead.-\"My grandmother remembers every corner of the land,\" he said. - \"She talks to us about it and she has instructed us to retrieve it, protect it, and farm it as she and my grandfather used to.\" Awaiting to return to her field, Mariam stands with confidence, looking out at her plot of land. \"If they offered me as much money as the number of grains of soil on my land, I will not accept. I want my land back - I don\\'t care about money,\" she said.- \"I feel the soil of our land running through my veins. One day on my land is worth a lifetime.\" Source:-Al Jazeera'],\n",
       " ['Kenya court quashes government order to close Dadaab Kenya\\'s high court declares government order to close world\\'s biggest refugee camp \"null and void\". Kenya\\'s high court has said it would be unconstitutional to close the world\\'s biggest refugee camp, which houses more than 200,000 people who have fled war in neighbouring Somalia.- In a ruling on Thursday, the court said a government order to shut the camp, which would have sent the refugees back to Somalia from the sprawling Dadaab camp, was illegal. Judge John Mativo, who issued the ruling, said Kenya\\'s internal security minister had abused his power by ordering the closure of the camp, which borders Somalia, in May last year. According to Mativo, the order had been given without consulting the people who would be directly affected by its implications, which was a violation of Kenya\\'s constitutional right to fair legal proceedings. \"Hence, the said decision is null and void,\" he ruled. READ MORE: \\'Forty percent of Somalis don\\'t have enough food to eat\\' Mativo also said that the order was discriminatory in nature and went against international treaties that protect refugees from being forced to return to persecution, adding that the Kenyan government had failed to prove Somalia was safe enough for the refugees. Speaking to Al Jazeera, Amnesty International\\'s Deputy Regional Director Michelle Kagari, said a durable solution should be explored for Somali refugees. \"This would include for example, exploring options for Somalis to be integrated into local communities, it would also include exploring options to increase resettlement opportunities for Somali refugees,\" she said. The ruling also blocked a government decision to disband the Department for Refugee Affairs. Amnesty International\\'s East Africa chief, Muthoni Wanyeki, hailed the ruling as \"historic\". He said: \"Today is a historic day for more than a quarter of a million refugees who were at risk of being forcefully returned to Somalia, where they would have been at serious risk of human rights abuses.\"- \"This ruling reaffirms Kenya\\'s constitutional and international legal obligation to protect people who seek safety from harm and persecution.\" The government had been planning to shut down Dadaab for more than six months. In June, Somalia\\'s ambassador to the US-critisised the plan-and said it would damage relations between Kenya and Somalia. \"Many parts of southern Somalia remain under the control of al-Shabab militias and there are almost daily clashes between them and Somali government forces, and African Union peacekeepers,\"-Al Jazeera\\'s Mohammed Adow, reporting from the Somali capital Mogadishu, said. \"If these people [refugees] were to be repatriated back here, they will be coming back to what is essentially a war zone.\" The government had denied that it would be abandoning refugees, saying it had made arrangements with the Somali government to resettle them. In November, the closure was-delayed by six months after calls by foreign nations to postpone it on humanitarian grounds. READ MORE: Somali refugees in Kenya fear being repatriated Kenya says Dadaab has become a hive for the al-Shabab armed group, and that it is a drain on the economy. Some refugees have voluntarily returned to Somalia in recent months, after pressure to close down the camp spread fear of being forcibly evicted among the residents of Dadaab.

Editor\\'s note: This film is currently not available online. After a long career working in business in the UK, Anwer Saleem has returned to Kolkata to revive the fortunes of his family\\'s ramshackle auction house, The Russell Exchange. It was bought from the British by his grandfather in 1940 and has been in the family ever since. Once it was the Sotheby\\'s of India but these days it is living out a much humbler reality.-The auctions attract people from across Indian society, rich and poor, but the company is not making a profit. The odds are stacked against Anwer, who needs to motivate the staff and his younger brother Arshad to modernise in the internet age. As the brothers come to terms with each other, their amusing relationship gives an insight into whether old family businesses can adapt and survive in 21st-century India. FILMMAKER\\'S VIEW By Ed Owles  For some time I had been looking for a subject about which to make my first hour-long film. I\\'m interested in spaces where significant exchanges, relationships or encounters occur, which has taken me from this auction house to oil rigs in the North Sea to the Libyan-Sahara. When I came across The Russell Exchange auction house I was immediately entranced by the place as a visual spectacle. It\\'s a setting bursting with stories and layers - strands of Indian society that reflect and affect the city\\'s narratives. I also wanted to make a film in India that avoided over-rehearsed tales of abject poverty, or bland headlines about the \"economic miracle\", and explore a more nuanced space where real Indians meet, laugh, argue and trade day in, day out, for better or worse. There\\'s a special poetry that exists there in its own contained world that mirrors the chaotic, crowded city outside its doors. The brothers\\' relationship is central to what is a character-driven film and provided me with a fantastically engaging and honest way to tell the story of the auction house. I hope the film will resonate strongly with audiences both within and outside India, touching on themes of brotherhood, financial difficulty, migration and heritage to create an intimate and thoughtful reflection of contemporary Kolkata and a unique place in the city\\'s centre that should be treasured. -  Source:-Al Jazeera'],\n",

President Donald Trump\\'s choice was given the green light on Wednesday by a vote of 52-47. Sessions had faced accusations of racism, and a Senate panel rejected him for a federal judgeship in 1986 amid concerns over allegedly racist comments he had made. \"This caricature of me from 1986 was not correct,\" Sessions said after his confirmation hearing last month. \"I deeply understand the history of civil rights ... and the horrendous impact that relentless and systemic discrimination and the denial of voting rights has had on our African-American brothers and sisters.\" On Tuesday, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, a darling of the political left, was silenced in the Senate for reading a 1986 letter from Coretta Scott King, the widow of the Rev Martin Luther King Jr, that criticised Sessions for his civil rights record. Democrats, civil rights and immigration groups have voiced alarm about Sessions\\' record of controversial positions on race, immigration and criminal justice reform. \"Minority parties who did not favour the previous administration\\'s cabinet appointees, typically said let\\'s just confirm them, and allow whatever incompetence to happen, and then we will come out later and blame the president for poor decision-making,\" Lara Brown, associate professor at George Washington University, told Al Jazeera. \"Nobody seems to have the long game in mind, or a much larger strategy.\" A known immigration hardliner, Sessions will take over the Justice Department as its lawyers are defending Trump\\'s temporary entry ban on people from seven predominantly Muslim countries and all refugees, the most controversial executive order of the young administration.

The 70-year-old was an early Trump supporter who became a pivotal figure in his campaign and transition team. He served as a prosecutor from 1981 to 1993, and won a seat in the Senate in 1996. Senate Democrat Chris Murphy said he was \"scared\" about changes Sessions could bring. \"[His ] history of opposing civil rights, anti-gun violence measures and immigration reform makes him uniquely ill-fitted to serve [as attorney general],\" Murphy said. \"I want a chief law enforcement official that will be a champion of the disenfranchised and dispossessed, not a defender of discrimination and nativism.\" READ MORE: Donald Trump clashes with courts over immigration ban Former vice-presidential candidate Timothy Kaine, also a Senate-Democrat, said Sessions\\' record raised doubts. \"Any attorney general must be able to stand firm for the rule of law even against the powerful executive that nominated him or her,\" Kaine said. \"In this administration I believe that independence is even more necessary.\" Trump was quick to congratulate Sessions on Twitter:- Congratulations to our new Attorney General, @SenatorSessions! pic.twitter.com/e0buP1K83z Sessions will assume office a week after acting Attorney General Sally Yates was removed by Trump for refusing to defend his travel ban.

       " ['nan nan Iran and the new Trump administration have already clashed with potentially disastrous consequences. The extreme vulnerability of the rapport between the two countries following the nuclear deal was on show recently as Iran tested a new long-range missile, and the Washington put Iran \"on notice\". Yet, it is unsurprising that after 35 years of enmity, the revived US-Iran relationship would stumble as a radically different leadership takes power in Washington. Indeed, it might fall further should a similar shift occur in May after presidential elections take place in Iran. Does this mean the nuclear deal is doomed? It may be. But if so, it would be as much by default as by design. Four unexpected consequences of ill-conceived moves on Washington\\'s part could intensify the conflict and collapse the deal. One smart move could save it. 1) Misreading Iran\\'s bluster as more than an \\'opening position\\'  US puts Iran \\'on notice\\' after missile test confirmation (2:11) The legality of the missile launch within the terms of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the nuclear agreement signed in 2015 by both governments, has drawn much speculation by American analysts, but no actual determination that it broke the letter of the law. The Trump administration\\'s inexperience in reading the tea leaves of Iran\\'s foreign policy manoeuvres, however, has led it to decide, that, legal or not, the launch was an insult and a threat. So it hurled back a threat of its own. Yet - much like Trump himself - the Islamic Republic is a prodder and doesn\\'t back down when it gets a reaction. The result: public denunciations and shows of power will likely escalate. 2) Viewing diplomacy with Iran as useless, assuming that all it understands is force To Trita Parsi, of the American Iranian Council (whose forthcoming book tells the inside story on how exactly the deal was done), to put shouty cards on the table without a soft-exit plan is to misunderstand the game of diplomacy, particularly when it comes to Iran. What the Iranians do is play multiple hands - the public stage, the back-corridors, the phone lines - which Trump\\'s predecessors did too. If the new administration only grandstands and doesn\\'t balance tough words with secret meetings and smart compromises that suit both countries, the relationship will crash. 3) Mistaking Iran for a failed state By placing it on the \"List of Seven\", Trump has put Iran in strange company. The other six are either at war, or lacking central government authority - unlike Iran, which has conducted high-level, government-backed international negotiations with the US over a significant security deal. This is shaming for Iran, just as it was when George W Bush inducted Iran into the Axis of Evil after it publicly offered to materially support Washington\\'s plans against al-Qaeda after 9/11.- READ MORE: Ayatollah Khamenei - Donald Trump shows real face of US As previous Iran nuclear negotiator Seyed Moussavian has frequently pointed out, Iran craves international respect, which once it felt forthcoming from Washington, contributed to the miraculous nuclear turnaround. Trump, by including Iran among the seven Muslim-majority countries whose citizens he tried to ban from entering the US, has signalled that no matter what it does to burnish its international image, Iran will never get US respect. From that perspective, why would he care that not a single Iranian has been apprehended for terrorism inside the US?- Misreading an adversary - or a friend - suggests the honeymoon is over.- -- 4) Imagining Iran as having no good options Iran today - post nuclear deal, free of UN and EU sanctions, restored as a regional power balancing Turkey and Saudi Arabia in Syria, and, critically, close to Russia - is not the lonely pariah of the past. To completely misjudge Iran, and allow the relationship of jabs and one-upmanship to deteriorate to a point where the use of force is the only option left on the table, would see the US going into war largely alone. - Its economy is big - it\\'s the second largest producer of both steel and cars in the Middle East. But its trade goes not west but east, to the booming markets of China and India, and north, to Russia. A report this week by the conservative Washington Institute of Near East Studies noted that Iran\\'s tight relationship with Moscow defies history, but reflects a solid pragmatism on both parts, that will be unfazed by Trump officials threatening to drive a wedge between them. US administrations have consistently underestimated Iran\\'s ability to survive international pressure, such as the travel bans and individual targets in Congress\\'s newest \"behavioural modification\" sanctions passed last week. Today, however, miscalibrating Iran\\'s regional clout could damage the US\\' relations with both Moscow and Ankara, each of which have recently been wobbly and such a miscalculation could seriously compromise American regional plans to contain the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). To completely misjudge Iran, and allow the relationship of jabs and one-upmanship to deteriorate to a point where the use of force is the only option left on the table, would see the US going into war largely alone. Though Israel might be at its side (and the already war-worn Saudi Arabia), Russia, supportive of Iran\\'s recent \"legal\" missile test, would not sit back idly, but demand booty and threaten the use of force in equal measure. Islamists, all supporters of al-Qaeda, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, ISIL or the Khorasan Group, would finally have their turn against the US as Donald Trump stumbles back into the morass from which President Barack Obama had withdrawn. - And the Europeans cannot be counted on. The European Union just re-iterated Iran\\'s compliance with the JPCOA once again, signalling that it does not share Trump\\'s view of Tehran\\'s misdemeanours. Yet all this could be avoided with one smart move. And one that fits with President Trump\\'s own self-image as a deal-maker. Offer a White Flag, and recast Iran as a valuable prospective market. Hardliners and reformers in Iran agree on little, and neither would find much in common with Trump today, except to agree that the JCPOA isn\\'t working well - currency regimes have been inadequately loosened, sanctions haven\\'t been sufficiently lifted, companies are hesitant to sign deals, and international bank engagement remains anaemic. For either side, destroying the JCPOA would not be difficult. But presidential greatness stems not from ripping up deals but, as Jimmy Carter with the Camp David Accords and Obama with Cuba both illustrated, it comes from making them work. By approaching Iran in a completely new way (as Richard Nixon did with China) and turning it into an economic opportunity for US companies - currently restricted from doing any business, no matter how lucrative, with oil-soaked Iran - it could be both a diplomatic, and a commercial coup for the new president. Sadly, that\\'s the last thing that Mr Trump would think of doing.

Pompeo\\'s unexpected official visit to Turkey, perceived as a sign of the new US administration\\'s support for Ankara, came on the back of a 45-minute telephone conversation between Trump and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on Tuesday.

It is safe to assume, after witnessing the first three weeks of his time in office, that President Trump\\'s approach to foreign relations is going to be unpredictable and erratic. Ali Faik Demir, Istanbul\\'s Galatasaray University \"He already jeopardised his country\\'s relatively peaceful relations with major players like Iran and China and created problems with several loyal US allies, like Australia and the EU. \"So the positive noises that are being made today [about Turkey\\'s relationship with the US], may not mean anything tomorrow.\" Predictions on the future of the US-Turkey partnership can only be made when \"there is a winner in the battle between the US establishment and Trump\", Metin Gurcan, a security analyst and former adviser to the Turkish military, said. \"We are either going to witness the Trumpification of the US state or institutionalisation of Trump,\" Gurcan told Al Jazeera. \"And if Trump comes out as the victor in that battle, we are going to have to reassess Turkish-American relations on a daily basis, depending on the president\\'s mood.\" But analysts agreed that, even if Trump\\'s tenure as president is expected to be full of surprises for Turkey, it is going to be shaped by the new president\\'s perceptions about security. \"There is one thing we know about Trump: His priority, at home and abroad, is security,\" Demir said. \" And we already know that Trump\\'s first phone call with Erdogan focused on security issues.\" Trump\\'s attitude towards Turkey is going to be shaped by the perceived security threat he will choose to prioritise, Gurcan explained. \"Trump may focus on containing Russia or Iran\\'s growing influence in the Middle East, or make the fight against radical armed networks like ISIL his priority,\" he said. \"Because Trump is not making his priorities clear, Ankara is not yet sure whether to feel content or concerned about the future of its relations with the US.\" According to analysts, discussions on Syria and the Syrian Kurdish forces are going to be the focus of Pompeo\\'s visit to Ankara. \"Turkish officials will undoubtedly try to convince Pompeo to support a Turkish-operated safe zone in northern Syria, \"Gurcan said. -\"They are also going to lobby for the eradication of Kurdish forces from that area.\" READ MORE: Kurds and refugees behind Turkey\\'s Syria offensive The Syrian Kurdish forces, under the banner of the People\\'s Protection Units (YPG), controls swaths of territory along Syria\\'s northeastern border with Turkey, while its political wing, the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD), claims control over an autonomous region now called Rojava. Turkey sees both the PYD and the YPG as extensions of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\\' Party (PKK), which has waged a bloody campaign against the Turkish state for nearly three decades. \"The Trump administration wants to end the security threats and immigration waves coming from the Middle East without sending American soldiers to the region,\" Demir said. \"I don\\'t think it really matters to Trump whether the Kurds or the Turks do the job for him. So, I believe, if Turkish government agrees to play a more active military role in the region, the new US administration would happily turn its back to the Kurdish forces.\" Turkey\\'s recent rapprochement with Russia is not likely to cause friction between Ankara and Washington, analysts explained. \"Trump has been sending positive signals to Moscow since the beginning of his election campaign,\" Demir said. \"Russia is already the primary actor in Syria, and Trump does not seem to be too concerned about this. At this point Erdogan\\'s close relations with Vladimir Putin would not be seen as detrimental to US interests.\" A further rapprochement between Russia and the US, on the other hand, may be problematic for Turkey\\'s aspirations in the Middle East, said Gurcan. \"President Barack Obama was treating the Euphrates River in Syria as a natural border between US and Russian influence zones - east of the river was under US influence and the west under Russian influence,\" he said. \"Now, Russia feels like entire northern Syria should be under its influence.

And it was all sudden: Yemi Osinbajo, the man Buhari temporarily handed power to, abruptly ended his participation at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Rumours of hsi death have spread-on fake news sites, and it is very worrisome that Buhari has refused to personally assure the country of his wellness. On one occasion Garba Shehu, one of his two spokesmen, tweeted a photo of Buhari supposedly watching Channels, Nigeria\\'s leading television station, but it all seemed a cover-up. The president could have called that same station to address his countrymen for just a minute. In such an ethnically divided country as Nigeria, such a move is crucial for the preservation of democratic sanity. With that assurance still missing, the power grabbers are already at work. Until May 2010, it seemed inconceivable that a member of a minority ethnic group would become president. Were that even to happen, it looked like an outright impossibility that the north - a region that typically sees the number-one seat as its birthright - would be the victim of such power transfer. But when northerner Umaru Musa Yar\\'Adua, the former president, left Nigeria for Saudi Arabia in November 2009 to get treatment for pericarditis and hadn\\'t returned by February 2010, Goodluck Jonathan, from the Ijaw ethnic group, was formally declared acting president. With Yar\\'Adua\\'s death three months later, Jonathan - a man who was chosen as Yar\\'Adua\\'s running mate not for his political appeal but for his reputation of \"never rocking the boat\" - became president. Either Buhari returns to office in earnest to personally oversee the fulfillment of the promises he made to Nigerians in 2015, or he gives up the position for someone else who will run his own vision and will be entirely accountable for the state of the nation. - The north had lost the power it had been impatiently waiting for since the turn of the Fourth Republic in 1999. Worse still, despite the protests of the northern elite, Jonathan ran for office, and won in 2010. The possibility of a repetition of this situation is why the north is particularly apprehensive over Buhari\\'s extended medical vacation. There is no chance Buhari\\'s northern friends, already accused of imposing a political stranglehold over the masses, will watch Osinbajo become president without a fight - in the event that Buhari is unable to continue in office owing to ill-health or death. Despite the denial of rumours that there is pressure on Osinbajo, a southwesterner, to resign, the meeting-of northern governors with the National Security Adviser Babagana Monguno and Chief of Army Staff Tukur Buratai has raised eyebrows. OPINION: One year ago, Buhari promised to change Nigeria Osinbajo himself has, in practice, done very little to dismiss the rumours. He has been typically calm and self-controlled in his response to matters, but his incoherence while discussing Buhari\\'s health was a striking giveaway. \"I think that the health status of Mr President is an issue that only Mr President would discuss at the appropriate time,\" he said in Abuja on Monday. \"Again, he is running test and all of that. Before you will be able to determine your health status you must be able to say this is my health status.\" Those closing words show Osinbajo is himself in the dark about the state of the president\\'s health.  Buhari must be honest with himself. At 74, he alone understands his body and the rigours it can accommodate. He may have temporarily transferred power to Osinbajo but that\\'s just a procedural constitutional requirement. Osinbajo will not exercise that power beyond the extent to which he knows Buhari would want him to. And, quite frankly, that is not what Nigeria needs at the moment. Either Buhari returns to office in earnest to personally oversee the fulfillment of the promises he made to Nigerians in 2015, or he gives up the position for someone else who will run his own vision and will be entirely accountable for the state of the nation. With the Nigerian currency naira falling to an all-time low, companies folding, and the cost of living on the rise, there were protests-against Buhari\\'s government across the country on February 6. There was no news from Buhari and his vice president could not be held wholly accountable. For all his failings, Jonathan remains a hero for conceding the 2015 election. Buhari will be a far bigger one were he to concede the presidency to a fitter candidate if his health deteriorates further. In his absence, the hawks will be hovering over Osinbajo, and the behind-the-scenes power play won\\'t result in any meaningful national development. Buhari must spare Nigeria the political heartbreak of governance by an absentee president. Fisayo Soyombo was the pioneer editor of Nigerian online newspaper TheCable.

       " ['What do Trump voters think of his performance so far? Chris Kenning We speak to Trump supporters in Kentucky, where he won 63% of the vote, and find widespread support amid some concern. By Since Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th US president on January 20, his actions have sparked global protests and concern. His executive order to halt all refugee entries for 120 days, suspend admission of Syrian refugees indefinitely and block for three months most travellers from the Muslim-majority nations of Libya, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen sparked a legal battle and nationwide demonstrations. He signed many other executive orders, including reinstating the \"Mexico City Policy\", which prohibits federal funding for international non-governmental organisations that provide or talk about abortions. He signalled his intent to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, and decreed that for every regulation the executive branch proposes, two others must be repealed. He threatened to withhold funding from so-called sanctuary cities that don\\'t cooperate with immigration enforcement. And that\\'s not all. He had a contentious phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, levelled attacks on the media and drew criticism for often-unfiltered tweets that included lambasting a federal judge. A women\\'s march on Washington drew hundreds of thousands of demonstrators. But in Kentucky, a conservative state where Trump won 63 percent of the vote, many Trump supporters say they aren\\'t shaken by the actions of a president who campaigned on a promise to upend the political status quo. Others, however, say they do have some concerns. Al Jazeera spoke with an array of Trump supporters about how they feel he is performing so far. Robert Berry, 40, a former Marine from Owensboro, Kentucky \\'The American voters got what they ordered - for once\\' \"The moves that President Trump has made over the last few weeks, I can only say, \\'wow\\'. Though I had imagined him to be a non-politician go-getter, I had no idea that he was going to dive in so quickly. Though many of his campaign promises sounded like a good starting point for a negotiation, I never dreamed that he was going to literally run through Washington DC like a bull in a china shop. Granted, this is what myself and others who voted for him wanted, but seeing it in action is a bit unsettling. As much as anything, Trump was my warning shot to the establishment, as I knew he would garner enough support to scare at least a few of them straight. I have a few concerns about the way he is steamrolling everyone in his way, but this is why I supported him - I knew he would start twisting some arms in Washington. Obviously, the president means every word that he said, or, at the least, is willing to back those words up with action. For better or worse, the American voters got what they ordered, for once. One thing is for sure: Politics will never be the same in America again.\" Jeff Klusmeier, 48, insurance agent from-Louisville, Kentucky- \\'Where the hell is Congress?\\' \"The speed of the executive orders is a little overwhelming. It\\'s like, hey man, can you deliberate on this? For years, Republicans had to sit back while Obama used his pen [to change policy with executive orders]. So there\\'s a lot of pressure on Trump right off the bat. But I have a problem with too strong of an executive branch of the government. It\\'s not good for the country. I didn\\'t like it when Obama did it, and I don\\'t like an overzealous president. You have to compromise and work with Congress. Where the hell is Congress? I\\'d like to see Congress step up. I feel like they\\'re abdicating their duty, and need to take some of the agenda back. The [travel] ban \"¦was a surprise that it came so quick. It caught everybody off guard. The rollout was a little bumpy. But it was a campaign promise, so in some ways he did keep his word to have some kind of ban and slow down the refugees coming in. Trump is working to deregulate businesses, which I think will bring back coal jobs to Kentucky, [which has] lost a lot since the war on coal. Mid-term elections in two years, that\\'s when we\\'ll really find out what people really think of how he\\'s doing.\" Sovanna Chann, 59, Cambodian-American factory worker from-Simpsonville, Kentucky \\'I\\'m a refugee, but I don\\'t regret voting for Trump\\' \"I\\'m a refugee.

Better jobs is the number-one reason I voted for him. I work in a cabinet factory. Even before he was inaugurated, Ford cancelled a new auto plant in Mexico. That\\'s what I like to see. I like what he said, that if you want to move out of the United States, OK, but when you come back to sell, there\\'s a border tax. So the companies will stay, and they\\'re going to bring the jobs back to Kentucky. Right now, he\\'s trying to take back jobs. After that, he\\'ll build the wall \"?so no drugs come from Mexico.

Everybody is picking on him. I\\'ll give him a B. I can\\'t give him an A. Too many people are drilling on him and being negative. No man could jump in there and straighten up the world in two weeks. He\\'s trying, he\\'s already working on things like banning illegal immigrants. Trump, he\\'s not being politically correct. I love it, I\\'m sick of that. It\\'s going to get better once all these people stop whining and protesting and give him a chance. The safety of the US is pretty important, but jobs are the next thing to that. But he is tackling jobs. He\\'s had a bunch to do with keeping work here, talking about putting taxes on stuff coming from other countries. That would have a real impact here. It would bring a lot of production jobs, and those are the ones that go overseas. I\\'m just an old biker with a 12th-grade education, but I\\'m a true American.

The march in Washington DC wasn\\'t a women\\'s march. It was an anti-Trump march. Not a single one could tell you what they were marching for. Women\\'s rights? Well, name one. They couldn\\'t.

He has kept his campaign promises [including an order to start unwinding the Affordable Care Act]. - I\\'m a registered Republican but when Obama ran the last time, I voted for Obama because I felt like it was in our national interest to have a healthcare system so people could get the healthcare and medication they deserve. That didn\\'t pan out so well. But the $1,300 a month my family and I were paying under Obamacare was too much for insurance, insurance that\\'s not that good and it was hard to find a doctor who would take it. My family wasn\\'t the only one. Thousands were affected by the healthcare system. So when this election came, Trump said he was going to repeal and replace Obamacare. I think that\\'s a fabulous idea. So I\\'m excited to see what Trump and the Republicans do to replace it.\" Tina Foley, 48, financial controller with six children, from Louisville \\'I feel like he is going to support law and order\\' \"The one thing that concerns me a little is the sanctuary cities losing funding.

My dad was in the military and a chief of police, so coming into the election cycle I was feeling very defensive about law enforcement [amid the Black Lives Matter protests that followed a string of police shootings]. I feel like Trump is going to support law enforcement and law and order. I do believe that will be a focus of his administration. If we have good jobs, it solves a lot of the other problems.

He\\'s already getting the government out of people\\'s lives. The immigration halt - it will probably go to the Supreme Court - but I wish the unelected court system would let him do what he was elected to do. Getting out of the Trans Pacific Partnership was a huge thing. Factory after factory after factory has closed because of NAFTA. I think this whole \\'He\\'s not prepared\\' or that it\\'s not running smoothly is a media talking point because they\\'re not happy with the outcome of the election.

       " ['Dozens of ISIL fighters killed by Turkish-led forces Battle for Syrian city of al-Bab intensifies with 58 ISIL fighters killed as rebels and government troops converge. \\'Progress is fast\\' Syrian rebels backed by the Turkish military have captured the outskirts of the ISIL-held city of al-Bab in northern Syria, the Turkish government and rebel sources said. The advance threatens an important ISIL stronghold, whose fall would deepen Turkish influence in an area of northern Syria where it has created a de facto buffer zone. The Turkish military said in a statement that 58 ISIL fighters had been killed in air raids, artillery fire, and clashes. Two Turkish soldiers were killed and 15 slightly wounded. Syrian government forces also advanced on al-Bab from the south on Wednesday, bringing them into close proximity with their Turkish and rebel enemies in one of the most complex battlefields of the six-year-old conflict. But Turkey said international coordination was under way to prevent clashes with the Syrian forces. \"The al-Bab operation must be completed immediately in the period ahead ... In recent days our special forces and the Free Syrian Army [rebels] have made serious progress,\" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told a news conference.  READ MORE: ISIL fighters \\'besieged\\' in Syria\\'s al-Bab in Aleppo In a sign of Turkish momentum and confidence, the government said its next target would be the Syrian city of Raqqa, de facto capital of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group, which is also under attack in its Iraqi stronghold of Mosul. Al-Bab has been a major target of a Turkish offensive launched in northern Syria last August to drive ISIL away from the border and prevent further gains by US-backed Kurdish militia that are also fighting the group. The city is just 30km from the Turkish border.  A Free Syrian Army rebel commander, speaking to the Reuters news agency from the southeastern outskirts of al-Bab, said Syrian government jets and helicopters were visible to the west of his position, adding there was now an \"indirect frontline\" between the sides. But an official in a military alliance backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said the city was being left to Turkish control, in what appeared to be part of a deal with Russia, Assad\\'s most powerful ally. Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said clashes with the Syrian forces had been avoided. \"As a result of coordination between coalition forces, the Turkish air force and Russia, necessary measures are being taken to prevent any unpleasant incidents or clashes,\" Yildirim said. Assad has been backed in the war by the Russian air force and an array of Iranian-backed Shi\\'ite militias. The Syrian army advance towards al-Bab is aimed at preventing deeper Turkish advances and safeguarding the city of Aleppo, 50km to the southwest. A Syrian rebel fighter reached by Reuters said he was speaking from inside al-Bab where ISIL lines were \"collapsing\". \"Praise God, the progress is fast,\" he said. \"The operation is continuing.\" The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based organisation that uses a network of contacts in Syria to monitor the war, said it was not yet clear if ISIL was on the ropes. It said at least six people had been killed and 12 more wounded in the latest shelling there. ISIL is being fought by three separate military alliances in northern Syria, including the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, which incorporate the Kurdish YPG militia. US support for the YPG has angered Turkey, which views it as an extension of a Kurdish militia that is waging a rebellion in Turkey. Turkish sources said President Tayyip Erdogan and US President Donald Trump agreed in a phone call overnight to act jointly against ISIL in al-Bab and Raqqa. The White House said in a statement that Trump spoke about the two countries\\' \"shared commitment to combating terrorism in all its forms\".  Source:-Reuters news agency'],\n",

US President Donald Trump has broken the ice with Chinese President Xi Jinping in a letter that said he looked forward to working with him to develop constructive relations, although the pair haven\\'t spoken directly since Trump took office. Trump also issued belated well-wishes to China for the Lunar New Year, the most important holiday in the world\\'s most populous nation. He had been the only US president in recent years not to have issued greetings when the holiday fell on January 28, triggering speculation in China as to whether it was an oversight or an intentional slight. A statement from the White House late on Wednesday said Trump wrote to Xi wishing the Chinese people greetings for the new year and the Lantern Festival that falls on Saturday. \"President Trump stated that he looks forward to working with President Xi to develop a constructive relationship that benefits both the United States and China,\" the statement said. READ MORE: Fake Donald Trump tweets filling up Chinese social media The letter also thanked Xi for his congratulatory letter on Trump\\'s inauguration and wished the Chinese people a prosperous Year of the Rooster, it said. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China commended Trump for sending Lunar New Year greetings to the Chinese people and said cooperation between the two countries was the only option. Wang Yiwei, a professor of international relations at Beijing\\'s elite Renmin University, said the letter suggested the new US administration wanted to signal the importance it attached to the US-China relationship, without risking being confronted on specific issues.  \"Trump has sent many messages that makes the world confused, like on the South China Sea and \\'One China\\' policy, so if he makes a phone call President Xi will ask \\'What do you mean?\\',\" Wang said. \"He wants to avoid this, so he just sends a letter for the first step.\"-- Trump and Xi have yet to speak directly since Trump took office on January 20, although they did talk soon after Trump won the US presidential election in November. The Foreign Ministry in Beijing said last week the two countries were remaining \"in close touch\". Trump has accused Beijing of unfair trade practices and currency manipulation, criticised China\\'s military buildup in the South China Sea, and accused Beijing of doing too little to pressure neighbour North Korea over its nuclear and missile programmes.

Beijing decried the phone call with Tsai and has rejected the other accusations. China has in fact been spending heavily from its pile of foreign currency reserves to prop up the value of its currency, which would make its exports less competitive. The prospect of a military confrontation over the South China Sea had also been raised by Trump\\'s chief strategist Steve Bannon when he hosted the conservative Breitbart News Daily radio show in 2015 and 2016.

       " ['Appeals Court Blocks Trump Bid to Reinstate Immigration Order nan A panel of federal appeals court judges ruled Thursday evening to keep a restraining order against Donald Trump\\'s controversial immigration action in place, foiling the administration\\'s attempt to get the action reinstated, according to court documents. The move capped a public campaign by the president to put pressure on the courts to rule in his favor, calling the decision \"easy\" and suggesting that the judge who made the original ruling could be to blame if a terrorist attack happens. Tonight, Trump lashed out against ruling from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in an all-caps tweet.  SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!  In its unanimous decision, the three-judge panel denied the Department of Justice\\'s bid for an emergency stay, saying that the president\\'s previous remarks about a Muslim ban potentially could be used as evidence, saying rights attached to non-citizens and saying the government did not present evidence that nationals from the affected countries perpetrated attacks in the U.S. \"We hold that the Government has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of its appeal, nor has it shown that failure to enter a stay would cause irreparable injury, and we therefore deny its emergency motion for a stay,\"?the panel, from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, wrote in the decision Thursday. The DOJ said in a statement it is reviewing the decision.         Last week, a Washington federal district court judge, James Robart, issued a temporary restraining order that blocked Trump\\'s executive action nationwide, saying the policy would cause \"immediate and irreparable injury\" and taking issue with potential religious discrimination as a result of certain provisions that could prioritize some groups over others. The appeals panel heard arguments from a lawyer representing the state of Washington Tuesday who argued that the executive order -- which temporarily halted immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries in the Middle East and Africa and temporarily shut down the refugee program -- discriminated on the basis of religion among other claims. Department of Justice lawyers claimed that the order was made on national security grounds and that Washington District Court Judge James Robart\\'s issuance of a temporary restraining order pausing the ban nationwide was \"Averbroad.\"?In Tuesday\\'s hearing, which was conducted by phone, states alleged that the teaching and research missions of their universities are harmed by the executive order\\'s effect on faculty and students who are nationals of the seven affected countries. In its ruling, the appeals court took issue with the government\\'s claim that the courts couldn\\'t review the president\\'s authority to suspend \"admission of any class of aliens.\" \"There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy,\" the judges wrote. \"Although our jurisprudence has long counseled deference to the political branches on matters of immigration and national security, neither the Supreme Court nor our court has ever held that courts lack the authority to review executive action in those arenas for compliance with the Constitution.\" The states also argued that the order effectively constituted a Muslim ban and offered multiple statements made by Trump during the presidential election that said he intended to implement such a ban. The judges agreed that Trump\\'s talk of a \"Tuslim ban\"?could potentially be used as evidence for discrimination as the case proceeds, a point which the government argued against. \"It is well established that evidence of purpose beyond the face of the challenged law may be considered in evaluating Establishment and Equal Protection Clause claims,\"?the judges said. But the appellate judges said \"we reserve consideration of these claims until the merits of this appeal have been fully briefed.\"?And the appeals panel also rejected the government\\'s argument that the restraining order was overly broad in applying to those who have never had contacts with the U.S. \"The procedural protections provided by the Fifth Amendment\\'s Due Process Clause are not limited to citizens,\" the judges wrote. Finally, the judges said that the government did not present evidence that there were terrorist attacks perpetrated in the U.S. by nationals of the countries affected by the ban. \"The Government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the Order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States,\" the judges wrote. \"Rather than present evidence to explain the need for the Executive Order, the Government has taken the position that we must not review its decision at all.\"   Trump unleashed a series of attacks on Robart following the judge\\'s initial decision to interrupt his order last week. On Twitter, the president called Robart a \"so-called judge,\"?said his decision was \"ridiculous and will be overturned,\"?and added that \"\\x9c[i]f something happens blame him and court system.\"?Those comments were later condemned by members of both major political parties. Trump\\'s Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch classified Trump\\'s criticisms of the judiciary as \"demoralizing\"?and \"disheartening\"?in conversations on Capitol Hill, according to a spokesman, but the White House insisted he was not referring to a specific case. The administration has denied that the order is a Muslim ban.'],\n",

       " ['A Timeline of President Trump\\'s Immigration Executive Order and Legal Challenges nan President Trump\\'s controversial executive order to temporarily ban travel to the U.S. by refugees and immigrants from some majority-Muslim countries has sparked protests across the nation, as well as legal challenges that are still working their way through the court system. Here\\'s a recap of how the executive order and the subsequent legal challenges against it were rolled out.  At 4:39 p.m. on Friday at the Pentagon, Trump signed an executive order that promised to keep \"radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America.\" The order, named \"Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States,\" took immediate effect to bar admission to the U.S. of all people with non-immigrant or immigrant visas from seven countries -- Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen -- for 90 days. It also bars entry to all refugees from anywhere in the world for 120 days, and places an indefinite ban on refugees from war-torn Syria. Hours after Trump signed his order, the public had not yet seen documents that would describe exactly how airports and government officials around the world would implement the new rules. At 6:58 p.m., the order was distributed to the White House press list.  Two brothers with Iraqi visas, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq, landed at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City overnight. The Department of Homeland Security immediately detained the two men, following the guidance of Trump\\'s executive order. The two men worked for the United States military in Iraq and were granted special visas as a result of their service, but despite going through the standard security checks, they were held by Customs and Border Protection at the airport. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a writ of habeas corpus at the Brooklyn Federal Court on their behalf. At 7 p.m. on Saturday night, Customs and Border Protection released the men. Throughout the day, though, outrage brewed in airports across the country where people gathered to protest the executive order. \"Hey ho! Muslim ban has got to go!\" some of the protesters chanted. People interpreted Trump\\'s immigration order as a ban on people of the Muslim faith. Trump, appearing at another executive order signing in the Oval Office, disagreed. \"It\\'s not a Muslim ban,\" he said, adding that \"in the airports, it\\'s working out very nicely.\" Meanwhile, hundreds of refugees and immigrants -- caught in communications limbo between the White House and the Department of Homeland Security -- remained at airports from coast to coast. On Saturday night, Judge Ann Donnelly of the Federal District Court in Brooklyn ruled that people stuck in airports nationwide could not be forced back to their original destinations, writing that individuals subjected to the order could face \"substantial and irreparable injury.\"  On Sunday morning, the White House faced backlash from politicians on both sides of the aisle. Republican Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham called the executive order a \"self-inflicted wound\" that \"may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, teared up as he demanded Trump to rescind the \"mean spirited and un-American\" order. Federal lawsuits were filed in New York, Massachusetts, Virginia and Washington on behalf of travelers who were detained in airports in the United States. In airports overseas, many people hoping to come to the United States were turned away. As public outcry amplified, the White House still appeared to be working out details of the executive order. On \"Meet the Press,\" White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said that the order did not apply to green card holders, adding to the confusion. Despite the stay issued in Brooklyn Federal Court, the White House maintained that the order remained in place. \"It is the right and duty of the President to do everything in his legal and Constitutional power to protect the American people. Saturday\\'s ruling does not undercut the President\\'s executive order,\" the White House said in a statement. \"All stopped visas will remain stopped. All halted admissions will remain halted. All restricted travel will remain prohibited. The executive order is a vital action toward strengthening America\\'s borders, and therefore sovereignty. The order remains in place.\" Later Sunday evening, the White House said that \"legal permanent residents are exempt from the travel restrictions in the new executive order,\" referring to green card holders.  Trump tweeted on Monday morning, \"Only 109 people out of 325,000 were detained and held for questioning. Big problems at airports were caused by Delta computer outage,...\" He continued in another tweet, \"protesters and the tears of Senator Schumer. Secretary Kelly said that all is going well with very few problems. MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!\" On Capitol Hill, Republican leaders sounded exasperated by the executive order\\'s haphazard roll-out and the administration\\'s lack of communication between major agencies. \"It should have been vetted by the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, the Department of Defense, and all of the affected agencies. I think then a lot of the obvious problems with it would have been identified,\" Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, told reporters. Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court in Seattle citing examples of residents impacted by the ban. The lawsuit included a separate emergency motion for a nationwide, temporary restraining order that would bar the enforcement of parts of Trump\\'s executive order.  U.S. Federal District Judge James Robart issued a restraining order on Friday to immediately halt Trump\\'s executive order nationwide, allowing travel to proceed as it did before the executive order was enacted. The same day, Hawaii filed a lawsuit asking the court to block implementation of the executive order.  Late on Saturday, the Department of Justice filed an appeal to Judge Robart\\'s restraining order with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. The Trump administration argued that the president is acting within his authority and that the ruling by Robart \"second-guesses the President\\'s national security judgment.\"  Early Sunday morning, the Ninth Circuit Court rejected the Justice Department\\'s request for an emergency stay on the restraining order. The court asked for briefings from both parties to be filed on Monday by 6 p.m. before it makes a decision on the case.  In a brief filed on Monday morning, Washington state and Minnesota argued that the executive order causes \"irreparable harm\" to businesses, schools, family relations and state residents\"?freedom to travel and is unconstitutional because it discriminates on the basis of religion. Fifteen other states joined in support of Minnesota and Washington, along with leaders of the tech world from Google, Facebook and Apple, in addition to the ACLU. The Department of Justice, in a brief filed just before the 6 p.m. deadline, said the travel restrictions are a matter of national security and the administration was excluding people from countries with ties to terrorism, not people of a certain religion. Former Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright and John Kerry joined former national security and foreign affairs officials, including Leon Panetta, Janet Napolitano, Lisa Monaco and Michael Hayden, and wrote a declaration to the appeals court that \"there is no national security purpose for a total bar on entry for aliens from the seven named countries,\" adding that as a national security issue, the executive order was \"ill-conceived, poorly implemented, ill-explained.\"  On Tuesday evening, the Ninth Circuit heard oral arguments from Justice Department lawyers and attorneys for the states of Washington and Minnesota. The hearing allowed each side to give 30-minute arguments. After listening to both sides, the three federal judges -- Judge William C. Canby Jr., appointed by President Jimmy Carter, Judge Michelle Friedland, appointed by President Barack Obama, and Judge Richard R. Clifton, appointed by President George W. Bush -- will decide the fate of Trump\\'s travel ban.  On Thursday evening, those three federal judges unanimously ruled to deny the Department of Justice\\'s bid for an emergency stay. In its unanimous decision, the judicial panel indicated that President Trump\\'s remarks on the campaign trail about implementing a ban on Muslims entering the United States if he was elected was a factor in their decision. The judges also held that the government failed to provide evidence that nationals from the seven affected countries had carried out attacks on U.S. soil. \"\\x9cWe hold that the Government has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of its appeal, nor has it shown that failure to enter a stay would cause irreparable injury, and we therefore deny its emergency motion for a stay,\"?the panel, from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, wrote in the decision Thursday. Department of Justice lawyers argued that the order was made on national security grounds and that Washington District Court Judge James Robart\\'s issuance of a temporary restraining order pausing the ban nationwide was \"\\x9coverbroad.\"?Following the decision of the 9th Circuit Court, the Department of Justice issued a statement saying they are \"\\x9creviewing the decision and considering its options.\"?They have no further comment at this time. In brief remarks to a small group of reporters waiting outside White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer\\'s office, President Trump called the 9th Circuit\\'s ruling a \"\\x9cpolitical decision\"?and said he looks forward to challenging the ruling in court. President Trump cautioned that he was concerned about the security of the nation, yet he was confident in his administration\\'s case. \"\\x9cWe\"\\x99ll win the case,\"?he said. \"\\x9cWe have a situation where the security of our country is at stake, and it\\'s a very, very serious situation and so we look forward, as I just said, to seeing them in court,\"?the president said.

The prosecutor's office said around 70 grams of TATP were seized in the home of a 20-year-old man in the Montpellier area, along with a liter each of acetone, oxygenated water and sulfuric acid. TATP, which can be made from readily available materials, was used in the November 2015 attack in Paris and the March 2016 attack in Brussels carried out by Islamic State extremists. Two other men were arrested, a 33-year-old and a 26-year-old, along with the 16-year-old girl, according to the prosecutor's office, which handles terrorism investigations in France. A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the unfolding investigation, said one of the suspects was believed to be planning a suicide attack but that the investigation had not yet uncovered a specific target.\"],\n",

President Vladimir Putin\\'s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the prospects of extending the New START Treaty that is set to expire in 2021 will \"depend on the position of our American partners\" and require negotiations. He wouldn\\'t say whether the Kremlin favors extending the 2010 pact that limited Russian and U.S. nuclear arsenals to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads each. Speaking in a conference call with reporters, Peskov pointed to a \"certain break in dialogue on strategic security issues\" during the Obama administration, and said Moscow and Washington now need \"an update of information and positions.\" Russia-U.S. relations have been strained over the Ukrainian crisis, the war in Syria and the allegations of Russia hacking of the Democrats in the U.S. presidential election. The Kremlin has welcomed President Donald Trump\\'s promise to mend the broken ties. While suggesting possible cooperation with Moscow to fight the Islamic State group in Syria, as a candidate Trump was critical of the New START and talked about a need to strengthen U.S. nuclear arsenals. In December, Trump declared on Twitter that the U.S. should \"greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability\" until the rest of the world \"comes to its senses\" regarding nuclear weapons. Putin has said that strengthening Russia\\'s nuclear capabilities should be among the priorities for the nation.'],\n",

In a signal that the incident hasn\\'t hurt a Russia-Turkey rapprochement, Peskov said on Friday that Erdogan is set to visit Russia next month.

       " ['Ex-Guardsman to Be Sentenced for Islamic State Group Support nan Mohamed Jalloh served six years in the National Guard and about 18 hours as a recruit of the Islamic State group. Jalloh, 27, of Sterling, Virginia, is to be sentenced Friday for providing material support to a terrorist group. Prosecutors are seeking a 20-year sentence. The defense is asking for a term of less than seven years. Jalloh is one of more than 100 people in the U.S. to be charged with terror offenses connected to the Islamic State since 2014, according to George Washington University\\'s Extremism Tracker, and one of seven from the northern Virginia area alone to be charged in the past two years. In Jalloh\\'s case, the charges originated from an FBI sting operation. After his arrest, though, Jalloh admitted that he had made his own contact with the group before he had ever been introduced to the FBI informant \"?contact the government had been unaware of at the time. Jalloh, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Sierra Leone, had traveled back to Africa with his father in 2015. While there, he met an Islamic State recruiter. In August 2015, Jalloh traveled from Sierra to Leone to stay with the group\\'s facilitator. He intended to travel to Libya to join the Islamic State, but the plans fell through. Later that year, Jalloh traveled to Niger, again with the intent of joining the group. This time, he went so far as to get on a truck with a bunch of other recruits to trek across the Sahara to Libya. But, in court papers, Jalloh described how he got cold feet and sneaked off the truck after 18 hours. \"Guys in the truck would whip people with a hose to pack you in,\" Jalloh said, describing his experience as a recruit. \"This was the worst, most scary situation that I had ever been in as an adult.\" Before returning to the U.S., Jalloh made contact online with an IS operative named Abu Saad Sudani, who put Jalloh in contact with a person he hoped would help Jalloh carry out an attack in the U.S. But that person turned out to be a government informant. In conversations with the informant, Jalloh discussed carrying out a Fort Hood-style attack. He also sent hundreds of dollars to an undercover FBI employee he believed was an IS member. Jalloh\\'s lawyers describe his interest in the Islamic State group as a \"flirtation\" that stemmed from a difficult childhood in war-torn Sierra Leone that left him with little parental guidance. They say that when Jalloh met with the informant, his goal was to be set up with a Muslim woman he could marry, but the informant continually steered the conversation to violence. In court papers, Jalloh renounces the Islamic State group. \"I feel like a complete idiot for accepting such a superficial and dishonest interpretation of Islam,\" Jalloh wrote in a letter to the court.'],\n",
       " ['Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Files 1st Legal Challenge Over Dakota Access Pipeline Easement nan A Native American tribe has filed the first legal challenge to block the nearly finished Dakota Access Pipeline from crossing under a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota, just hours after the federal government gave the green light for construction to proceed. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Wednesday granted an easement to the developer of the four-state crude oil project, allowing it to install the final section of the 1,172-mile pipeline. Part of this 1.25-mile section will run under Lake Oahe just upstream of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe reservation. \"the safety of those located on Corps-managed land remains our top priority, in addition to preventing contaminants from entering the waterway,\"?said U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Omaha District Commander Col. John Henderson in a statement. \"We appreciate the proactive efforts of the tribes to help clean the protest site ahead of potential flooding along the river, typical during the runoff season.\"?While the Army Corps says this area is federally owned land, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe cites an 1851 treaty that it says designates the land for Native American tribes. The tribe, which claims its members were never meaningfully consulted before construction began, sued in July to block the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline. That lawsuit is pending, and the Army Corps and the company behind the pipeline argued in court papers that they followed a standard review process. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, which has joined the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe\\'s lawsuit against the pipeline, filed a motion at the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia this morning seeking a temporary restraining order \"go halt construction and drilling\"?under and on either side of the land surrounding Lake Oahe. The tribe argues that the pipeline \"will desecrate the waters upon which Cheyenne River Sioux tribal members rely for their most important religious practices and therefore substantially burden the free exercise of their religion,\"?according to court documents obtained by ABC News. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, which is part of the Great Sioux Nation, is requesting that the judge immediately issue a temporary restraining order to stop construction, with a hearing to be held at the court\\'s earliest convenience. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe filed a separate motion seeking a preliminary injunction directing the Army Corps to withdraw the easement issued to the pipeline company Wednesday. The tribe alleges that the easement granted is \"entirely unlawful\"?under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, according to the court documents. \"the government has granted the easement, and Dakota Access has begun to drill. This court cannot wait until the harm begins to issue equitable relief. When the free exercise of religion is at stake, a threat certain to that right is enough to constitute irreparable harm,\"?the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe states in court documents. \"And in view of the threat to the tribe\\'s and its members\"?constitutional right, this court may not wait until the oil is slithering under the tribe\\'s sacred waters. The law entitles the tribe to relief as soon as the government acts to threaten their rights.\" The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is expected to file its own legal challenge to the easement by the end of the week. U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg has ordered that arguments on the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe\\'s motion for a TRO will be heard on Monday, during a previously scheduled status hearing in the case.           The granting of the easement follows Tuesday\\'s decision by Robert Speer, the acting secretary of the Army, to terminate the notice of intent to perform an environmental impact statement and to notify Congress of the Army\\'s intent to grant permission for the Oahe crossing. Speer said the decision was made based on a sufficient amount of available information. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe said in a statement Tuesday it will \"Challenge any easement decision\"?on the grounds that the environmental impact statement was \"wrongfully terminated.\"?The tribe said it will also \"demand a fair, accurate and lawful environmental impact statement to identify true risks to its treaty rights, including its water supply and sacred places.\"?If the Dakota Access Pipeline is completed and begins operating, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe said it will \"seek to shut the pipeline operations down.\"?After receiving the easement to build the pipeline across land on both sides of the reservoir, the Texas-based developer, Energy Transfer Partners, announced it would resume construction immediately. The Dakota Access Pipeline, which would connect oil production areas in North Dakota to an existing crude oil terminal near Patoka, Illinois, is expected to be in service in the second quarter of 2017. \"We plan to begin drilling immediately,\"?a company spokesperson told ABC News in a statement Wednesday night. \"the drill under Lake Oahe will take approximately 60 days. It will take an additional 23 days to fill the line to Patoka, Illinois, enabling Dakota Access to be in service in approximately 83 days.\" The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has been at the forefront of massive and prolonged protests that have stalled work on the pipeline for months. The demonstrations have drawn thousands of Native Americans, environmental activists and their allies to the Standing Rock reservation. The protesters, who call themselves water protectors, argue that the pipeline will threaten the reservation\\'s water supply and traverse culturally sacred sites. Kelcy Warren, the CEO of Energy Transfer Partners, has said that \"Concerns about the pipeline\\'s impact on local water supply are unfounded\"?and \"multiple archaeological studies conducted with state historic preservation offices found no sacred items along the route.\"?In the final days of President Barack Obama\\'s administration, Jo-Ellen Darcy, the assistant secretary of the Army for civil works, announced on Dec. 4 that an easement would not be granted for the pipeline to cross under the large reservoir on the Missouri River. She said at the time of the decision that the Army Corps would engage in additional review and analysis, including a \"robust consideration and discussion of alternative locations for the pipeline crossing the Missouri River.\"?All these steps, Darcy determined, would best be accomplished by the Army Corps\"?preparing a full environmental impact statement allowing for public input \"?a process that could take years. She is no longer in the position after the change in administrations. The move to deny the easement was hailed by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and other pipeline opponents as a major victory. But on his second weekday in office, President Donald Trump signed a memorandum aimed at advancing the Dakota Access Pipeline, as well as one directed at the Keystone XL pipeline.

       " ['Under Fire, Conway Maintains Support of the President nan Kellyanne Conway, the high-profile White House counselor, has come under fire from Democratic and Republican lawmakers, fact checkers and the media. But she\\'s so far maintained the support of her boss, President Donald Trump. Trump backed Conway both publicly and privately Thursday after House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, criticized her for promoting Ivanka Trump\\'s fashion line during a television appearance and urged the Office of Government Ethics to review the matter. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Conway had been \"counseled\" on her comments, but he would not expand on what that entailed. The president appeared to take issue with his own press secretary\\'s depiction, telling staff that he believed it was unfair to Conway and made it sound like she was in trouble, according to a person with direct knowledge of his comments. A White House spokeswoman said that while Trump didn\\'t see Conway\\'s television comments urging people to buy Ivanka Trump\\'s products, he believed she was \"merely sticking up\" for his daughter after Nordstrom dropped her fashion line. The flare-up came in the midst of a rough stretch for Conway, who is among Trump\\'s most visible advisers. Her reference to a nonexistent \"Bowling Green massacre\" made her a punchline for comics and internet pranksters. She said it was a slip of the tongue as she was describing the 2011 arrest of two Iraqi nationals in a failed plot to send weapons overseas to al-Qaida. It was later discovered that she had made that misstatement before. Conway was then caught up in the bad blood between the Trump administration and CNN. The news network was angered last weekend when Vice President Mike Pence made the rounds of Sunday talk shows and pointedly left out Jake Tapper\\'s CNN show. CNN said it \"passed\" when Conway was offered instead, while Conway said she was unable to appear. Conway\\'s high-profile and close relationship with Trump has created tension with some other advisers. One Trump associate said Conway\\'s standing with some senior staff had been hurt by her recent missteps, though the person noted that her relationship with the president remained strong. The Trump associate and the person with knowledge of the president\\'s comments about Conway insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss internal matters. Conway\\'s sales pitch for Ivanka Trump was particularly notable in that it sparked a rebuke from Chaffetz, a Republican who until now has not questioned the young administration on ethical matters. Chaffetz said Conway\\'s actions were \"wrong, wrong, wrong, clearly over the line, unacceptable.\" The Utah congressman and the ranking Democrat on the committee, Elijah Cummings of Maryland, jointly asked for the ethics review. The Office of Government Ethics advises federal employees on such issues but is not an enforcement agency; enforcement falls to Congress, the General Accounting Office, the FBI, various inspectors general and others, OGE noted on Twitter. Ultimately, it is up to Trump to punish employees for ethics infractions. While Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are not subject to ethical regulations and laws for federal employees, Conway, who is a counselor to the president, is. Among the rules: An employee shall not use his or her office \"for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise.\" \"For whatever reason, the White House staff evidently believes that they are protected from the law the same way the president and vice president are,\" said Stuart Gilman, a former special assistant to the director of OGE. In addition to the House Oversight Committee, two liberal-funded government watchdog groups pounced on Conway\\'s comments, filing ethics violation complaints with OGE. A third group, the Project on Government Oversight, asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions to open a Justice Department investigation. Nordstrom reiterated Wednesday that its decision to drop Ivanka Trump\\'s brand was based on its performance, not politics. The company said sales of her items had steadily declined over the past year, particularly in the last half of 2016, \"to the point where it didn\\'t make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now.\" \"?Associated Press writers David Bauder, Anne D\\'Innocenzio and Matthew Ott in New York, Michelle Price in Salt Lake City, Catherine Lucey and Chad Day in Washington contributed to this report. \"?Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC and Julie Bykowicz at http://twitter.com/bykowicz'],\n",

Trump vs. senators, senators vs. senators, White House vs. media and a jumble of insults and shifting loyalties that\\'s already become familiar in Donald Trump\\'s Washington.

The noise of the last 24 hours \"? up to and including the extraordinary statements relayed from Judge Neil Gorsuch -\"?may actually make him more likely to get the job Trump wants him to get. Whether by intricate design or utter luck, Machiavellian maneuverings or sheer happenstance, the controversy over the courts is playing out like the kind of distraction the president revels in. On that point, at least, bipartisan consensus is emerging.       \"This little back and forth that the news media is consumed with \"?I think if anything, it helps the case of Neil Gorsuch,\"?Sen.

Trump called him a \"so-called judge,\" said that a \"bad high-school student\"?would know better, and also warned that \"if something happens blame him.\"?That appears to have spurred Gorsuch, a federal appeals judge for more than a decade, to tell senators that attacks on the judiciary are both \"disheartening\"?and \"demoralizing.\"?The president disputed accounts of what Gorsuch said, first made public by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, and then confirmed by the nominee\\'s spokesman, choosing then to attack Blumenthal by saying he misled the public about his service in Vietnam. Other senators backed up accounts of Gorsuch\\'s take. Yet the White House maintained that Gorsuch was \"lery clear\"?that he was not commenting on any specific action \"? and press secretary Sean Spicer said the president won\"t change his rhetoric about judges. \"Part of the reason the president got elected is because he speaks his mind,\"?Spicer said. By Thursday afternoon, Trump was also warring with another senator \"? this one, a legitimate Vietnam War hero, in Sen. John McCain \"? on an unrelated matter regarding a raid the president authorized in Yemen. And Spicer revealed that a top Trump adviser, Kellyanne Conway, had been \"Counseled\"?after telling TV viewers to go out and buy products associated with Ivanka Trump, after the president said his daughter had been treated badly by a retailer. In other words, it was another dizzying day in the Washington Trump vowed to take by storm. Trump, as always, was at the center of the storm \"?and not always in a good way.

Motorists jammed highways as thousands of residents rushed to flee the area downstream from the Oroville Dam, about 150 miles northeast of San Francisco, after authorities warned that the emergency spillway could fail, the National Weather Service. Hundreds of cars lined up on Highway 99, creating a bumper-to-bumper traffic jam as people streamed north, the Associated Press said.  I don\\'t know what they are doing, but we aren\\'t even moving. This is pretty bad. #OrovilleSpillway #OrovilleDam pic.twitter.com/bvhtm3aY8A  Lake Oroville, one of California\\'s largest man-made lakes, has been swollen by more than a month of heavy rains. Water began topping the emergency spillway on the 770-foot-tall dam, the nation\\'s tallest, on Saturday, causing erosion damage that could lead to a surge of water being released, officials said. Officials from California\\'s Department of Water Resources said they planned to use helicopters to drop rocks to fill in the gouge in the spillway. Residents of Oroville, Gridley, Live Oak, Marysville, Wheatland, Yuba City, Plumas Lake, and Olivehurst were all ordered to evacuate immediately, authorities said. Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said officials made the decision to nearly double the volume of water being released from the dam to 100,000 cubic feet per second to drain the lake quickly and stop erosion at the top of the auxiliary spillway. \"Hopefully, that will release pressure on the emergency spillway and they\\'ll find a repair to prevent a complete failure,\" Honea said on Sunday. \"[The] situation is dynamic and could change anytime.\"  A video posted by K Newton (@fignorcal) on Feb 11, 2017 at 7:48pm PST  Oroville Mayor Linda Dahlmeier told ABC News the lake had been lowered to 2 feet below the top of the emergency spillway thanks to the increased volume of water being released through the dam\\'s main spillway. The lake level is currently being lowered at a rate of about 4 inches per hour, the mayor said, adding that the erosion area has stopped progressing and stabilized. California Governer Jerry Brown issued an emergency order in response to the situation. \"The state is directing all necessary personnel and resources to deal with this very serious situation,\"?Brown said in a statement on Sunday.

The helicopters, along with two airplanes, will also be available for search and rescue on Monday near the Oroville Dam, California National Guard Adjunct General David Baldwin said at a news conference late Sunday. He added that the California National Guard put out a notification to all 23,000 soldiers and airmen to be ready to deploy if needed.

The president, who spent the weekend at his private club in Florida, has yet to comment on Flynn\\'s status. Nor has Vice President Mike Pence, who previously denied that Flynn had discussed sanctions with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the U.S. Pence and Flynn spoke twice on Friday, according to an administration official. Trump has told associates he is troubled by the situation, but he has not said whether he plans to ask Flynn to step down, according to a person who spoke with him recently. Flynn was a loyal Trump supporter during the campaign, but he is viewed skeptically by some in the administration\\'s national security circles, in part because of his ties to Russia. The administration official and both people with ties to Trump spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. Stephen Miller, Trump\\'s top policy adviser, skirted the issue on several Sunday news shows, saying it was not his place to weigh in on the \"sensitive matter\" or to say whether the president retains confidence in Flynn. Several other White House officials did not respond Sunday to questions about whether Trump had confidence in his national security adviser. Their silence appeared to reflect some uncertainty about the views of the president, who is known to quickly change his mind. On Friday, The Washington Post reported that Flynn addressed sanctions against Russia in a call with Kislyak. The report contradicted repeated denials from Trump officials, including Pence, who vouched for Flynn in a televised interview. Flynn has since told administration officials that sanctions may have come up in the calls, which coincided with the Obama administration slapping penalties on Russia for election-related hacking. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who led Trump\\'s transition planning before the election, said Flynn would have to explain his conflicting statements about his conversations with Kislyak to Trump and Pence. \"Gen. Flynn has said up to this point that he had not said anything like that to the Russian ambassador. I think now he\\'s saying that he doesn\\'t remember whether he did or not,\" Christie said on CNN. \"So, that\\'s a conversation he is going to need to have with the president and the vice president to clear that up, so that the White House can make sure that they are completely accurate about what went on.\" The controversy surrounding Flynn comes as the young administration grapples with a series of national security challenges, including North Korea\\'s reported ballistic missile launch. The president, who was joined at his Mar-a-Lago estate by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, voiced solidarity with Japan. Trump meets Monday with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and later in the week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The White House is also dealing with fallout from the rocky rollout of Trump\\'s immigration executive order, which has been blocked by the courts. The order was intended to suspend the nation\\'s refugee program and bar citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. Miller, who was one of the architects of the order, maintained in a round of Sunday show interviews that the president has sweeping executive authority when it comes to barring foreigners he deems pose a risk to the country. He said Trump will do \"whatever we need to do, consistent with the law, to keep this country safe\" and slammed judges who\\'ve stood in his way. \"This is a judicial usurpation of the power. It is a violation of judges\\' proper roles in litigating disputes. We will fight it,\" Miller said in an interview on \"Fox News Sunday.\" As for the administration\\'s next steps, Miller said that \"all options\" remain on the table,\" including a Supreme Court appeal. Trump said on the plane ride to Florida on Friday that he was considering signing a \"brand-new order\" as early as Monday to try to bypass the legal challenges. \"As you know, we have multiple options, and we are considering all of them,\" Miller said on ABC\\'s \"This Week.\" The comments come amid an outcry from immigration activists over an \"enforcement surge\" by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers that officials say is targeting immigrants who are in the country illegally and have criminal records. Advocacy groups contend the government has rounded up large numbers of people as part of stepped-up enforcement. The agency calls the effort no different from enforcement actions carried out in the past. But Trump and Miller appeared eager to take credit for the action. \"The crackdown on illegal criminals is merely the keeping of my campaign promise. Gang members, drug dealers & others are being removed!\" Trump tweeted. Added Miller on NBC\\'s \"Meet the Press\": \"We\\'re going to focus on public safety and saving American lives and we will not apologize.\" \"?Follow Jill Colvin at http://twitter.com/colvinj and Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC'],\n",
       " ['Desperate immigrants risk perilous winter trek to Canada nan After he was denied asylum in the U.S., Seidu Mohammed\\'s fear of being deported to his native Ghana, where he believes he\\'d be killed or jailed, became so great that he set out in brutal winter conditions to cross illegally into Canada. Mohammed and his friend lost all their fingers to frostbite after a 10-hour trek across fields of waist-high snow in sub-zero temperatures. Despite their injuries, the two men say they now feel safe. They\\'re part of a small but growing number of immigrants risking the northern border crossing. \"God blessed Canada with good people,\" said Mohammed, 24. \"I see the difference between Canada and the United States.\" In Manitoba, which borders Minnesota and North Dakota, groups that specialize in helping refugees say the pace of arrivals has quickened since Donald Trump became president and banned travel from seven majority-Muslim countries. Refugees who spoke with The Associated Press cited Trump\\'s order and anti-Muslim campaign rhetoric as the main reasons for going north. Rita Chahal, executive director of Manitoba Interfaith Immigration Council, said her group normally sees 50 to 60 refugees from the U.S. each year. But The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said that more than 40 have been picked up at the border near Emerson, Manitoba, in just the last two weekends.   Chahal said most are natives of Somalia, which was in Trump\\'s travel ban, but also from Ghana, Djibouti, Nigeria and Burundi. They are making the trip at a dangerous time. \"This is one of the coldest seasons in the coldest parts of our country,\" said Ghezae Hagos, a counselor at Welcome Place in Winnipeg, Manitoba, who deals with refugees upon arrival. He said that on Feb. 4, five Somalis said they walked for five hours in the fields in minus-30 Celsius (minus-22 F) weather. The increase at the Manitoba crossing is likely related to Minnesota\\'s status as the leading U.S. landing spot for Somali immigrants. Marc Prokosch, an immigration attorney in Minneapolis, said it\\'s been growing more difficult for Somalis to get asylum in recent years, mostly because they lack documents to prove their identity. There is also fear of deportation. U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement said 90 Somalis were deported from across the U.S. on Jan. 25. Bashir Yussuf, a Somali refugee who spent three years in San Diego and the last two months in Minneapolis, crossed the border Feb. 5 with two others. Yussuf, 28, was ordered deported in 2015. He had remained in the U.S. under monitoring, hoping to get a favorable ruling to stay. \"But when Trump took over, eventually my hope died,\" he said.   He called the trip \"the hardest thing I\\'ve ever done,\" describing a three-hour journey over ice and snow. \"I even jumped two rivers over snow. You go down deep,\" he said. \"My life was in danger in many ways.\" While the number of Illegal crossings to Canada is dwarfed by the hundreds of thousands from Mexico on the southern border, the numbers are increasing. In Quebec, the number has tripled in one year to 1,280 in the current fiscal year, which runs through March. Illegal crossings to British Columbia doubled to 652 last year. In Manitoba, the RCMP intercepted 68 people three years ago but 430 this fiscal year. Near Emerson \"?about 80 miles north of Grand Forks, North Dakota, on Interstate 29 \"?officials on the U.S. side have done enough rescues in the past month that Aaron Heitke sees it as a humanitarian issue. Heitke, the Border Patrol\\'s Grand Forks sector commander, said he\\'s contacted consulates for some African countries asking them to spread information about the hazards of a Minnesota winter. \"Family groups with small children that, if someone hadn\\'t gone out and picked them up, they\\'d have frozen to death,\" Heitke said. Those fleeing the U.S. avoid border posts because of an agreement \"?called Safe Third Country \"?that requires migrants to request refugee protection in the first safe country they arrive in. That means migrants arriving at a Canadian border post are rejected and told to apply in the U.S.   An opposition party lawmaker grilled Canada\\'s immigration minister in Parliament on Thursday, saying the agreement discourages refugees from crossing at an official border checkpoint. New Democrat lawmaker Jenny Kwan also asked the minister whether he still believes the U.S. is offering a high degree of protection for asylum seekers. Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen, himself once a refugee from Somalia, stressed that Canada is welcoming to refugees. Canada has taken in almost 40,000 Syrian refugees, triple the U.S. intake of Syrians in 2016.   But Hussen said the agreement with the U.S. will remain because it \"provides an orderly system of managing asylum claims.\" Mohammed, who feared for his safety in Ghana because he\\'s bisexual, met Razak Iyal, also a Ghana national, at a bus terminal in Minneapolis. Both men had been denied asylum. Worried about deportation, they decided to travel together and took a bus to Grand Forks, North Dakota. They then each paid a taxi driver $200 on Christmas Eve to get them close to the border. They crossed on foot, fearing death in the brutal cold until a truck driver saved them. \"We were standing in front of the highway looking for help for almost seven hours. Nobody was willing to help, no traffic stopped. We gave up. That was our end of our life,\" Iyal said. Mohammed and Iyal are hoping for prosthetic fingers, and Iyal said he wants to bring his wife to Canada. \"We feel like we are home,\" Iyal said. \"We feel we are a part of Canada. ... They were talking to us with respect.\" \"?Forliti reported from Minneapolis, Minnesota. Doug Glass contributed from Minneapolis.'],\n",

Bowe Bergdahl will try Monday to convince a judge that he cannot get a fair trial on charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy because of highly charged statements made by President Donald Trump. The pretrial hearing before a military judge at Fort Bragg is expected to focus on statements that Trump made during the presidential campaign. Bergdahl is scheduled for trial in April and could face a life sentence if convicted of misbehavior before the enemy. He is accused of endangering the lives of soldiers who searched for him after he walked off his post in Afghanistan in 2009. Defense attorneys argue that Trump violated Bergdahl\\'s due process rights by repeatedly calling him a \"traitor\" and making other harsh statements about the soldier. The defense motion, filed shortly after Trump was sworn in as president, cites more than 40 instances of Trump\\'s criticism at public appearances and media interviews through August 2016. Bergdahl\\'s attorneys argue that potential jurors may feel obligated to agree with the new president and would have a hard time ignoring what he said. Although Trump repeatedly said Bergdahl should face stiff punishment, even suggesting he be thrown out of a plane, prosecutors contend that any reasonable observer would understand that Trump\\'s comments amounted to campaign rhetoric and should not be taken literally. They argue that Trump\\'s use of the term \"traitor\" was not meant in the legal sense, but in a conversational way. Bergdahl, who is from Idaho, has said he walked off his post to cause alarm and draw attention to what he saw as problems with his unit. He was held captive by the Taliban and its allies for five years. The Obama administration\\'s decision in May 2014 to exchange Bergdahl for five Taliban prisoners prompted some Republicans to accuse Obama of jeopardizing the nation\\'s safety. \"?Follow Jonathan Drew at www.twitter.com/jonldrew'],\n",

A White House official said the two countries would launch a new task force called the United States Canada Council for the Advancement of Women Business Leaders-Female Entrepreneurs. The official said Trudeau\\'s office reached out to discuss working on a joint effort, noting that this was seen as an area of shared interest between both leaders. Ivanka Trump, who has been a vocal advocate for policies benefiting working women, was involved in recruiting participants and setting the agenda for the meeting and will attend, the official said. Ivanka Trump stressed the importance of maternity leave and child care on the campaign trail, and has recently been meeting with business leaders to discuss those issues. The White House official said that Trump\\'s economic agenda will include a \"focus on ensuring women enter and stay in the work force and addressing barriers facing female entrepreneurs.\" The official requested anonymity to provide details in advance of the meeting. Advancing women has been a clear priority for Trudeau. In late 2015, he drew attention for naming a Cabinet that was 50 percent women, saying that he chose a group that \"looks like Canada.\" Trump did not promise to appoint a gender-balanced Cabinet and has named a smaller number of women and minorities to top jobs. \"Our team reached out and suggested as it is an important part of the prime minister\\'s agenda and of our economic growth plan,\" a Canadian official said. \"It seemed like a natural fit given their commitments in their platform as well.\" The official requested anonymity to discuss the meeting in advance. Trump has offered a childcare plan and has signaled an interest in working on those issues. The business round table will be part of an itinerary that includes a bilateral meeting and a working lunch. The visit is crucial for Canada, which relies heavily on the United States for trade. Trump has said he wants to discuss his plan to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement, which involves the United States, Canada and Mexico. There are fears Canada could unintentionally be sideswiped as Trump negotiates with Mexico. Female executives from the United States and Canada are expected for the round table, including General Electric Canada CEO Elyse Allan, TransAlta Corp. CEO Dawn Farrell, Linamar Corp. CEO Linda Hasenfratz, T&T Supermarket Inc. Tina Lee and Schnitzer Steel Industries CEO Tamara Lundgren. Also expected are Julie Sweet, CEO-North America for Accenture, NRStor CEO Annette Verschuren, Monique Leroux, chair of the board of directors for Investissement Qu?bec. Carol Stephenson, of the board of directors for General Motors Co. will attend in place of the GM CEO. Additionally, the meeting will include Katie Telford, Trudeau\\'s chief of staff, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland and Dina Powell, assistant to the president and senior counselor for economic initiatives. Powell, Telford and Freeland were involved in setting up the council and recruiting the CEOS. The council includes many of the meeting attendees, as well as Mary Barra, General Motors CEO, GE Vice Chair Beth Comstock and Catalyst CEO Deborah Gillis. Topics at the event will likely include issues like providing maternity leave and childcare, how to recruit and retain women and how to better support women entrepreneurs. Ivanka Trump does not have an official White House role. But her husband, Jared Kushner, is a senior adviser to the president and she stepped away from her executive positions at the Trump Organization and her lifestyle brand to move her family to Washington.

Hernandez already is serving a life sentence for the 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez\\'s fianc?. A guide to the trial and key background about the case: THE DEFENDANT Hernandez, 27, was a star tight end for the New England Patriots. He grew up in Bristol, Connecticut, and played football at the University of Florida before being drafted by the Patriots in 2010. He played for the Patriots from 2010 to 2012. The team released him in June 2013, shortly after he was arrested in Lloyd\\'s killing. In 2015, Hernandez was convicted of murder in Lloyd\\'s death and is serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole. \"?THE VICTIMS Daniel de Abreu, 29, and Safiro Furtado, 28, were close friends who attended high school and served in the military together in Cape Verde before coming to the United States and settling in Boston. Family members and friends of the men have packed the courtroom for many of Hernandez\\'s pretrial hearings. \"?THE KILLINGS The two men were fatally shot one night in July 2012 as they sat in a car at a red light after leaving a Boston nightclub. Prosecutors say Hernandez followed the men and fired five shots into their car after de Abreu accidentally bumped into Hernandez at the club and spilled some of his drink. At Hernandez\\'s arraignment, prosecutor Patrick Haggan told a judge that in the months before the shooting, Hernandez had become increasingly convinced that people had been \"testing, trying or otherwise disrespecting him when he frequented nightclubs in the area.\" \"?THE TRIAL Jury selection was scheduled to begin Monday in Suffolk Superior Court in Boston, but was postponed Sunday as a heavy overnight snowstorm approached. Prosecutors said jury selection would likely begin Tuesday, instead. Opening statements are slated for March 1. Prosecutors plan to call Alexander Bradley as their star witness. Bradley, a former friend of Hernandez, was with him in his car the night he allegedly shot de Abreu and Furtado. Prosecutors say Hernandez shot Bradley in the face in 2013 because he was worried Bradley might implicate him in the double slaying. Bradley survived, but lost his right eye. Hernandez is charged with witness intimidation in the Bradley shooting. Prosecutors have also said they plan to show jurors two Hernandez tattoos they say relate to the killings of de Abreu and Furtado. \"?THE DEFENSE Hernandez has pleaded not guilty and denied any role in the shootings of de Abreu and Furtado. His lawyers have not revealed their defense strategy in court, but they are expected to challenge Bradley\\'s credibility. In a recent court filing, prosecutors asked the judge to prohibit Hernandez\\'s lawyers from telling the jury about Bradley\\'s criminal record. In a recent court filing, prosecutors said they anticipate that Hernandez\\'s lawyers may try to argue that Bradley \"had the propensity to commit the crimes\" Hernandez is charged with. In January, Bradley was sentenced to five years in prison for shooting up a bar in Hartford, Connecticut, in 2014. No one was hurt. \"?This story has been corrected to show jury selection is likely to begin Tuesday, not Thursday.'],\n",

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the agency operating under the Department of Homeland Security that is responsible for handling deportations, arrested more than 160 foreign nationals this week in Los Angeles, the majority of whom had criminal records. ICE LA Field Office Director David Marin said in a press call that the raids conducted were not related to Trump\\'s executive order, and described them as being \"nothing out of the ordinary.\" Between 2009 and 2015 the Obama administration removed more than 2.5 million people through immigration orders, shattering records, and earning him the nickname \"Deporter in Chief\" among rights groups and activists. As recently as 2016, Obama drew sharp criticism from some Democrats over ordering raids that targeted women and children, according to Reuters. But ACLU senior attorney Lee Gelernt told ABC News that while they were \"not pleased\" with Obama\\'s handling of deportation raids, his group is concerned that the Trump administration will expand those efforts. The rapid response team would bring together the ACLU, private law firms and local community groups to ensure that individuals facing deportations have access to counsel right away. \"This administration is just getting started and we\\'re anticipating much worse,\" Gelernt said in a phone interview, citing the language Trump uses about immigrants as his reasoning for his concern that Trump\\'s approach could be more severe than Obama\\'s. \"His rhetoric is already scaring a lot of people in immigrant communities.\" In September, the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council, the official union representing ICE\\'s 5,000 federal immigration officers and law enforcement support staff, endorsed Trump\\'s campaign for president.

North Korean state media said leader Kim Jong Un was at the site to observe the launch and expressed pleasure at the North\\'s expansion of its strategic strike capabilities. \"These are serious military and security threats,\" Jeong Joon-hee, spokesman at the Ministry of Unification, told reporters. \"Pyongyang has no intention of backing away from its goal to become a country with nuclear weapons.\" A report on the launch carried early Monday by the North\\'s Korean Central News Agency said Kim watched from an observation post and gave the order to fire the \"Pukguksong-2,\" which it said was a \"Korean style new type strategic weapon system.\" It is believed to have flown about 500 kilometers (310 miles) before splashing down into the ocean in international waters. The report said the test proved \"the reliability and security\" of a new mobile launching system, the solid fuel that was used and the guidance and control features of the ballistic missile. Solid fuel can give missiles longer range and make detecting them before launch more difficult because they can be readied faster than liquid fuel missiles. The report also said the test verified control and guidance capabilities and said the missile can be \"tipped with a nuclear warhead.\" It suggested the launch conducted in a \"lofted\" style, which puts the missile into a high trajectory rather than a lower one that gives it more range, in order take \"the security of the neighboring countries into consideration.\" It added Kim \"expressed great satisfaction over the possession of another powerful nuclear attack means.\" \"Now our rocket industry has radically turned into high thrust solid fuel-powered engine from liquid fuel rocket engine and rapidly developed into a development- and creation-oriented industry, not just copying samples,\" he said. \"Thanks to the development of the new strategic weapon system, our People\\'s Army is capable of performing its strategic duties most accurately and rapidly in any space: under waters or on the land.\" North Korea had warned it was ready to test its first intercontinental ballistic missile. The U.S. Strategic Command, however, said it detected and tracked what it assessed to be a medium- or intermediate-range missile. The reports of the launch came as Trump was hosting Abe and just days before the North is to mark the birthday of leader Kim Jong Un\\'s late father, Kim Jong Il. After receiving word of the launch, Trump stood at his south Florida estate with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who called the move \"intolerable.\" Appearing with Trump at a news conference at Trump\\'s estate, Abe condemned the missile launch as \"absolutely intolerable.\" He read a brief statement calling on the North to comply fully with relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions. He said Trump had assured him of U.S. support and that Trump\\'s presence showed the president\\'s determination and commitment. Trump followed Abe with even fewer words, saying in part: \"I just want everybody to understand and fully know that the United States of America stands behind Japan, its great ally, 100 percent.\" Stephen Miller, Trump\\'s chief policy adviser, said Trump and Abe had displayed \"an important show of solidarity\" between their nations. \"The message we\\'re sending to the world right now is a message of strength and solidarity; we stand with Japan and we stand with our allies in the region to address the North Korean menace,\" Miller said during an interview Sunday with ABC\\'s \"This Week.\" The firing of the missile is a major challenge for the Trump administration, said George Lopez, an expert in economic sanctions and nuclear disarmament and a professor emeritus of peace studies at the University of Notre Dame. \"The Sunday test of an intermediate-range ballistic missile by the North Korean regime is in clear violation of past United Nations Security Council resolutions and recent warning from the U.S.,\" Lopez said. \"As such, it is a significant challenge to the Trump Administration because it has yet to develop its policies toward the region, toward North Korea, or its role in the UN and its use of economic sanctions. So we may learn a lot about Mr. Trump\\'s crisis diplomacy in the coming days.\" South Korea\\'s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that the missile was fired from around Banghyon, North Pyongan Province, which is where South Korean officials have said the North test-launched its powerful midrange Musudan missile on Oct. 15 and 20. The missile splashed down into the sea between the Korean Peninsula and Japan, according to the U.S. Strategic Command. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters it did not hit Japanese territorial seas. The North conducted two nuclear tests and a slew of rocket launches last year in continued efforts to expand its nuclear weapons and missile programs. Kim Jong Un said in his New Year\\'s address that the country had reached the final stages of readiness to test an ICBM, which would be a major step forward in its efforts to build a credible nuclear threat to the United States. Though Pyongyang has been relatively quiet about the transfer of power to the Trump administration, its state media has repeatedly called for Washington to abandon its \"hostile policy\" and vowed to continue its nuclear and missile development programs until the U.S. changes its diplomatic approach. Just days ago, it also reaffirmed its plan to conduct more space launches, which it staunchly defends but which have been criticized because they involve dual-use technology that can be transferred to improve missiles. \"Our country has clearly expressed its standpoint, that we will continue to build up our capacity for self-defense, with nuclear forces and a pre-emptive strike capability as the main points, as long as our enemies continue sanctions to suppress us,\" Pyongyang student Kim Guk Bom said Sunday. \"We will defend the peace and security of our country at any cost, with our own effort, and we will contribute to global peace and stability.\" South Korean Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, who is also the acting president, said his country would punish North Korea for the missile launch. The Foreign Ministry said South Korea would continue to work with allies, including the United States, Japan and the European Union, to ensure a thorough implementation of sanctions against the North and make the country realize that it will \"never be able to survive\" without discarding all of its nuclear and missile programs. \"?Associated Press writers Kim Tong-Hyung in Seoul, South Korea, Jill Colvin in Palm Beach, Florida, and Edith M.

       " ['North Korea launches ballistic missile test nan North Korea fired off a ballistic missile into the East Sea from Banghyeon North Pyongan Province early Sunday, according to South Korean officials. South Korea\\'s military is analyzing exactly what type of missile it was but there\\'s a strong possibility that it was a midrange Musudan type, according to officials. North Korea has test fired a total of eight Musudans, but only one was successful last June. South Korea\\'s joint Chiefs of Staff said the missile flew about 310 miles. Estimates vary over how far this mobile intermediate-range ballistic missile could travel, but at its best the Musudan would be able to reach U.S. military bases in Guam. Analysts in Seoul have been expecting some sort of military provocation ahead of late Kim Jong-il\\'s birthday on February 16 and the largest ever joint military exercises between the U.S. and South Korea scheduled to begin in two weeks.   According to the statement, the two officials strongly condemned the launch and agreed that the countries will explore every possible way to suppress North Korean provocations. The launch today comes only two days after President Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe strongly urged North Korea to abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and not to take any further provocative actions.  #ICYMI: Joint Statement with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on North Korea. pic.twitter.com/qEC87FKB1D  In a brief joint statement with Trump at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, Saturday night, Abe called the missile launch \"absolutely intolerable.\" \"North Korea must fully comply with the relevant U.N. security council resolutions,\" he said. Abe, who has spent the weekend with Trump in South Florida and had private meetings today, said that he and the president were dedicated to working together and strengthening their alliance. Trump echoed the Japanese prime minister, saying, \"The United States of America stands behind Japan a great ally 100 percent, thank you.\" Trump gave no further remarks, and neither leaders answered questions from the press corps. U.S. Strategic Command spokesman Lt. Colonel Martin O\\'Donnell said the North Korean missile was a medium or intermediate range ballistic missile. It was not an ICBM as North Korea had warned in early January it was close to testing. O\\'Donnell told ABC News that they are still assessing what type of missile was launched. A Musudan is an intermediate-range ballistic missile, but it could have also been a medium-range ballistic missile, he said. Japan\\'s chief cabinet secretary said the missile did not land in Japanese territorial seas. Yoshihide Suga said that Abe was notified and ordered that intelligence be gathered about what had occurred, and to check on the safety of navigation of flights and ships.

       " ['China blames US, South Korea for North Korea missile launch nan China, facing criticism that it is not doing enough to pressure North Korea to drop its nuclear program, said Monday that the root cause of North Korean missile launches is Pyongyang\\'s friction with the United States and South Korea. North Korea fired a banned ballistic missile on Sunday, its first test since U.S. President Donald Trump took office. The missile, launched as Trump hosted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Florida, is believed to have flown about 500 kilometers (300 miles) before splashing down in international waters. Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China opposed the launch, which violated U.N. Security Council resolutions that call for an end to North Korea\\'s nuclear and missile tests. China is North Korea\\'s largest source of trade and aid, and Trump has complained that Beijing is not doing enough to pressure Pyongyang. Beijing counters that its influence is overstated and suggests that Washington\\'s refusal to talk directly to North Korea is impeding progress toward a solution. \"The root cause of the (North Korean) nuclear missile issue is its differences with the U.S. and South Korea,\" Geng told reporters at a regular briefing. Geng said China, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, has been \"completely and comprehensively\" implementing Security Council resolutions on the nuclear issue. He said Beijing \"has been striving for a settlement of the Korean Peninsula issue by proactively engaging in mediation and promoting peace talks.\" Although generally dismissive of sanctions, Beijing has signed on to successive rounds under the U.N. Security Council, and last month banned more items from being exported to North Korea, including plutonium and dual-use technologies that could aid its nuclear program. Geng urged all sides to refrain from provocative action and said China would continue participating in Security Council discussions in a constructive and responsible way. Beijing appears concerned that the U.S. and South Korea will speed up the planned deployment of an advanced missile defense system in South Korea designed to counter a missile attack from the North following the latest launch. Beijing objects to the system because it would possibly be able to observe Chinese military movements. Shi Yuanhua, a Korean studies professor at Shanghai\\'s Fudan University, said that from Pyongyang\\'s perspective, it was a good time to launch a missile because the new U.S. administration hadn\\'t decided what approach to take with North Korea, and Beijing was at odds with Washington and Seoul over the anti-missile system. \"Whether or not to abandon nuclear weapons concerns North Korea\\'s core national interests and there is no way for China to get it to change its stance with a few words of persuasion, and it can\\'t solve the problem by applying a ban on exports,\" Shi said. \"The key for solving the problem lies in the hands of the U.S. If the U.S. is willing to sit and talk with North Korea, China will be happy to promote it,\" he added. A Communist Party newspaper said in an editorial Monday that the timing of Sunday\\'s launch, a day after the end of China\\'s 15-day Lunar New Year period, suggests Beijing\\'s participation in U.N. Security Council sanctions is having a \"positive effect.\" Last year, North Korea launched a long-range rocket on the eve of China\\'s most important holiday, in a snub to its chief ally. \"?Associated Press researcher Yu Bing contributed to this report.'],\n",

       " ['Democrats consider their future and who to pick as party chair nan Supporters of Congressman Keith Ellison\\'s bid to become the next Democratic National Committee chair held mismatched signs -- some from a nurses\"?union, others from different labor groups and the Minnesota representative\\'s formal campaign for the party office. The hundred or so people who came to a Democratic Party meeting in Baltimore on Saturday backing Ellison\\'s candidacy sang and marched around the building\\'s lobby. But they weren\\'t the only contingent there. Ellison, who backed Sen. Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primary, was the early favorite in the race to lead the party\\'s national political organization after the party took a surprise beating last fall. The congressman was one of the first to throw his hat in the ring and enjoyed quick endorsements from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and grassroots organizations like MoveOn and Democracy for America as well as Sanders. But now with just two weeks before the party\\'s election, there is a crowded field of candidates. Democratic National Committee members, who include state party officials and officeholders, are choosing from a group of top-tier candidates as they struggle to determine who would best diagnose and treat the party\\'s ills. Thomas Perez, who was President Obama\\'s secretary of labor, entered the race late but came in with gusto and big-time backing. Almost every major player in the Obama administration apart from the former president himself has given Perez a thumbs up, including former Vice President Joe Biden. Still, many organizers in the Ellison and Sanders camp view Perez as representative of the same old approach to politics that has recently failed Democrats and, even worse, a rejection of the populist energy and dynamism surging in the party\\'s base. In talks with reporters and his pitch to DNC members over the weekend, Perez responded to being labeled the \"establishment\"?candidate by pointing to his record. \"I fought for established principles of anti-discrimination, access to opportunity for everyone, and making sure we value our nation\\'s diversity,\"?he said in an interview with ABC News, before running through a list of past accomplishments from challenging the right-wing Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio to fighting legal battles for marriage equality and against Wall Street. \"I\"ve taken on those battles because I believe in those established values of opportunity and inclusion\"?I\\'m proud to have worked for Ted Kennedy, Barack Obama, and I want to bring those values and take those values into action here,\"?Perez said. But he appeared somewhat defensive when asked about whether he can compete with Ellison\\'s progressive street-cred. \"There\\'s not one candidate here that has the monopoly on the grassroots support,\" Perez said. \"We all have a lot of grassroots support because We\\'re all worked in the grassroots.\"?The meeting in Baltimore was one of a series of events the party has held around the country since November to allow Democratic leaders including local state chairs and elected officials the chance to ask questions of the candidates for DNC head. Democrats are clearly concerned about how to unify different factions in the party and best support -- and ultimately utilize -- ground-up, local organizing taking place around the country in opposition to the policies of President Trump. There is also anxiety among some in the party that the competition between Ellison and Perez too closely resembles a proxy battle of the bitter 2016 primary. That in part is why lesser-known candidates are getting a close look too for the chairperson\\'s role. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg\\'s bid has gained some momentum the last few weeks. Saturday, he presented himself as an alternative to the two frontrunners. \"Why not go with somebody who isn\"t a product of one faction or another faction, but somebody who is here to deliver the fresh start our party needs?\"?said Buttigieg. He argued that even if the party had won the White House in November it would still be in trouble due to its atrophying local organizations. \"If we recognize that the answers are going to come from our local communities, put in a local organizer, a local mayor who\\'s been running and winning elections in one of the reddest states in America to deliver results to the Democratic Party.\" Conventional wisdom among party members seems to be that none of the hopefuls have yet secured the majority of votes needed and so the election will likely take multiple rounds of ballots at the end of the month. The longtime chair of the state party in New Hampshire, Raymond Buckley, went on the offensive against Buttiggieg on Saturday and chided the mayor for having backed Clinton. Buckley emphasized that after he stayed neutral in the 2016 primary race Sanders won his state by a landslide. One reoccurring conversation at these Democratic meetings is about what exactly went wrong during the 2016 race, and there is no love lost in talk of the Clinton campaign or of recent former heads of the party. Buckley had one of the more buzzy answers Saturday when he blamed the party for wasting money attacking President Trump and failing to devise it\\'s own message. \"When we are running hundreds of millions of dollars worth of commercials, telling the voters that our opponent is offensive, when you are worried about your damn paycheck, when you\\'r worried about your job and where your kids are going to do to school, you don\"t really give a crap about whether the president is an insult to us,\"?Buckley said to big applause. Traditionally, the Democratic Party chairperson\\'s role is a mix of fundraiser, spokesperson and manager, and some candidates clearly have a background or advantage in one of these areas. But finding someone who will both personify the fight against Trump and lead the rebuilding of a massive, arguably atrophied party, may remain a tall order.'],\n",

Michelle Obama leaves the White House with sky-high approval ratings after a campaign season where enormous and enthusiastic crowds jammed into her every appearance, shouting that she should to run for office. Retrospectives of the Obama presidency praise everything from her healthy food to her high fashion. But in fact, just about every first lady comes into office at a disadvantage. (Except perhaps the first White House hostess dubbed \"Hirst lady\"?by the press. James Buchanan\\'s niece, Harriet Lane, moved in after Jane Pierce spent her four years in the Executive Mansion mourning the death of her son, causing one writer to judge: \"Ler woebegone face\"?banished all animation in others.\"? The title comes with no job description, and a great deal of suspicion. The public knows that the president\\'s wife is likely to have a great deal of influence but she can\"t be fired. And each first lady is pretty much left to figure out how to handle it for herself. One exception: Laura Bush and her staff worked to make smooth her successor\\'s path. Even so, Michelle Obama took some time to get comfortable in the role, to choose the causes where her voice would make a difference and to organize the allies to work with her to bring about change. Mrs. Obama was at something of a disadvantage because she had never been first lady of a state. For both Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton that experience had provided the closest thing to a test run for the national role. Not only had they learned how to promote their projects, they also already knew what it was like to take hits from political opponents and the press. Melania Trump will arrive with none of that preparation and with no close friends nearby as she tries to navigate through the treacherous waters of the nation\\'s capital. Much has been made of the fact that she is not the first first lady to be foreign born -- that distinction goes to Louisa Catherine Adams, the wife of John Quincy. But Mrs. Adams was the daughter of an American living in London at the time of her birth. By the time she went to the White House her husband had served in the Senate and for eight years as secretary of state. She was so wily about the ways of Washington that she wrote her father-in-law that it was her \"location\"?to get her personality-challenged spouse elected president. No neophyte she. Contrast that with Melania Trump, who will be thrust into this very public position with no political preparation beyond the recent campaign. Michelle Obama and her staff have offered to be helpful and Mrs. Trump would be wise to accept those offers. She just has to hope that her husband doesn\"t tweet something that offends the people who want to give her a helping hand. Cokie Roberts is a political commentator for ABC News.

But the country shrugged off suggestions it should be doing more to intervene in the rogue state\\'s military affairs, pinning the test down to Pyongyang\\'s testy relations with Washington and Seoul. North Korean state media hailed the Sunday test as a success, claiming a previously unpublicized part of the country\\'s arsenal -- a Pukguksong-2, an intermediate-range missile -- was launched under the supervision of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. North Korea is prohibited from carrying out ballistic missile launches under UN Security Council resolutions aimed in part at curbing the country\\'s development of nuclear weapons. China\\'s Foreign Ministry said that his country was opposed to launch activities in violation of the resolutions. \"Under current circumstances, relevant sides should not provoke each other or take actions that would escalate tensions on the Korean Peninsula,\" ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular press briefing Monday. \"As I have pointed out repeatedly in the past, the root cause to the North Korea nuclear missile issue is the conflicts between North Korea and the United States, as well as between North and South Korea.\" North Korea\\'s relationship with China -- its most important ally -- has kept Pyongyang afloat as sanctions have crippled and isolated it from the rest of the world. But in recent years, China has taken a tougher line on the North Korean nuclear program, voting in favor of UN sanctions and issuing condemnations when it conducts provocative military tests. Russia\\'s Foreign Ministry also spoke out against the test, the first since US President Donald Trump\\'s inauguration, saying in a statement that it was in \"defiant disregard\" of UN resolutions. Russia and China were both members of the Six Party Talks -- a diplomatic attempt to curb North Korea\\'s nuclear program that started in 2003 -- along with the US, Japan, and North and South Korea. \\'Clear provocation to Japan\\' The United Nations Security Council said it plans to hold consultations on an \"urgent basis\" Monday afternoon regarding North Korea, according to the US Mission to the UN. The meeting was requested by the US, South Korea and Japan -- whose Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was visiting President Trump in the US when the missile was fired and landed in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea. Abe said that the test was \"absolutely intolerable,\" while President Trump said that the United States \"stands behind Japan, its great ally, 100%.\" Japan\\'s chief Cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said the fact the launch came as Abe met with Trump made it \"a clear provocation to Japan and the region.\" Tokyo has already lodged protests against North Korea via its embassy in Beijing, he said. What can the Pukguksong-2 do? Sunday\\'s test has stoked concerns that Pyongyang may be getting closer to a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile than previously thought. The Pukguksong-2 is nuclear-capable, state media claims, and can travel from 3,000 to 5,500 kilometers (1,864 to 3,417 miles). A US official said the missile tested traveled 500 kilometers (310 miles) before landing in the Sea of Japan and that it was launched from North Pyongan province. It is believed to have used a solid-fuel propelled engine which enables faster launch and increases the mobility of the launch process, according to a spokesman of the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman. The Joint Chiefs also believe that Pyongyang employed a cold-launching system, in which the missile is lifted off the ground using pressure and then ignited mid-flight, as opposed to igniting it on the ground -- which is said to be less stable, the spokesman said. Kim expressed satisfaction over \"the possession of another powerful nuclear attack means, which adds to the tremendous might of the country,\" state media reported.'],\n",

It was a jaw-dropping counterpoint to Trudeau\\'s carefully cultivated image of calm. And it was all caught on camera. In May 2016, while debating a contentious piece of legislation on assisted suicide, Trudeau \"manhandled\" a member of Parliament and elbowed another, apparently swearing as he went. He apologized, twice, and the negative attention was mostly limited to Canada. No such luck for Trudeau\\'s next misstep. As the world reacted to the death of Fidel Castro, Trudeau said in a statement that the Cuban leader had been a \"larger than life leader who served his people.\" He left out any mention of Castro\\'s record on human rights and his history of oppression.  The criticism poured in. #TrudeauEulogies started trending, with mock tributes to despots past and present. In the end, Trudeau agreed that Castro was a dictator. Even before that ruckus could die down, Trudeau found himself in the middle of yet another scandal. His office confirmed that the Prime Minister spent his winter holiday on the private island of the Aga Khan -- and used the billionaire religious leader\\'s private helicopter to get there. An ethics investigation is underway. And no sooner had the new year begun than tragedy struck in Quebec City, where a local college student allegedly shot to death six men at a mosque. It was one of the worst attacks to target Muslims in a Western country. Make Trudeau great again Trudeau used the massacre to double down on his message of inclusion. \"Muslim-Canadians are an important part of our national fabric,\" he said. The attack came as Trudeau, aware of his waning popularity and aiming to shed the label of \"limousine liberal,\" embarked on a cross-country town hall road show. He got grilled, heckled and yelled at. But some commentators saw it as a successful act of contrition after several weeks of damaging missteps. \"That\\'s why he did this incredible tour of the country that no one\\'s ever seen before,\" said Craig Oliver, chief political commentator for CTV News. \"He\\'s authentic,\" said Oliver, who has known Trudeau since childhood. \"He has real good instincts about people and about politics.\" \\'Sunny ways\\' still under threat As he works to dig out of his domestic rut, Trudeau faces new threats to his progressive politics. There\\'s still a strain of nationalist populism that runs deep in Canada. Oh, and then there\\'s Donald Trump. Former Vice President Joe Biden suggested weeks before he left office that Trudeau, along with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, would inherit the liberal mantle from former President Barack Obama. \"The world\\'s going to spend a lot of time looking to you, Prime Minister, as we see more and more challenges to the liberal international order since the end of World War II,\" Biden said. But is Trudeau up to the task? The Prime Minister is an avowed feminist, free-trader and self-appointed cheerleader for diversity. And just a week before Trump was sworn in, Trudeau issued a thinly veiled swipe at his new American counterpart. \"There are things that we hold dear that the Americans haven\\'t prioritized,\" he said at a town hall event. \"And I\\'m never going to shy away from standing up for what I believe in -- whether it\\'s proclaiming loudly to the world that I am a feminist, whether it\\'s understanding that immigration is a source of strength for us and Muslim-Canadians are an essential part of the success of our country today and into the future.\" After the Trump administration announced its travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries, Trudeau tweeted, \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada\" \"Almost everything that Trump represents, Trudeau resents,\" Oliver said. Face to face with Trump As Trudeau preps for his meeting with Trump, some say he should remember the words of his late father, who in the 1960s said that living next to the United States was like \"sleeping with an elephant\" -- every \"twitch and grunt\" affects you. \"Agitating the President of the United States is not a good strategy especially when the President is Donald Trump because he has such a thin skin,\" pollster Nanos said. Trudeau and Trump are sure to agree on some issues, including support of the Keystone XL Pipeline. But for Trudeau, nearly every facet of his country\\'s economy could be affected by his relationship with Trump. \"There\\'s just so much riding on it,\" Oliver said. \"You know, 75% of Canada\\'s goods are sold in the United States. That border has to stay open for business.\" For his part, Trudeau said as much last week during a public appearance ahead of his White House visit. \"We both got elected on commitments to strengthen the middle class and support those working hard to join it,\" the Prime Minister said. \"And that\\'s exactly what we\\'re gonna be focused on in these meetings -- making sure that the millions of good, middle-class jobs on both side of our borders that are dependent on the smooth flow of goods and services and people back and forth across our border are reinforcing the deep connections and friendship between Canada and the United States.\"'],\n",
       " ['Trump set to meet Canada\\'s Trudeau at the White House (CNN)President Donald Trump will meet for the first time Monday with Canada\\'s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, an ideological opposite who nonetheless hopes to avoid clashing with his new US counterpart. In his previous US visits, Trudeau found a leader almost exactly aligned with his liberal worldview and youthful image. In return, then-President Barack Obama met with Trudeau often, counseling his younger ally on how to best advocate for the progressive agenda he championed. Now, Trudeau is arriving to a very different White House. He will balance the need to maintain close ties with a mandate from anxious Canadians to press Trump on his more controversial views. The meeting is Trump\\'s third official visit from a head of government at the White House. In his first three weeks in office, he\\'s also welcomed the British and Japanese prime ministers, and will host Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu Wednesday. Trump\\'s previous bilateral sessions were marked by comity and a focus on shared priorities. But in Trudeau, Trump will encounter a leader further apart from him in both age and global outlook than his previous two visitors. Aides both in Washington and Ottawa insist Trump and Trudeau will seek to emphasize neighborly bonds during their first face-to-face meeting, but their stylistic approaches will be on full view during a midday news conference. Disputes between the US and Canada rarely veer into anything resembling combativeness, though disagreements do exist, including on the import of softwood lumber and, under Obama, the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which Canada supports (Trump took action early in his term to restart the process of building the oil pipeline). Under Trump, however, the differences between the two countries could become more plain. Trudeau, a 45-year-old liberal, has made a point of actively welcoming refugees fleeing war in Syria, even visiting the Toronto airport in 2015 to greet a planeload of migrants. When Trump signed his controversial executive order barring Syrian refugees entry into the country, Trudeau wrote a pointed message on Twitter: \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength. #WelcomeToCanada.\" The message was accompanied by a photo of the Prime Minister greeting a young girl during his 2015 visit to the airport. Even then, though, Trudeau refused to actively criticize the immigration order, which is currently mired in legal challenges and, for now, on hold. He said Friday he planned to discuss \"all sorts of things that we align on\" with Trump, but would also confront areas of disagreement \"in a respectful way,\" Refugee policy isn\\'t the only divide between Trudeau and Trump. The leaders have expressed vastly differing views on climate change and economic policy as well. Trump has vowed to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement between Mexico, the US, and Canada, though detailed talks about what\\'s to be included in a new accord weren\\'t likely to be hashed out Monday.'],\n",

After sweeping the night\\'s top awards for song and record of the year for \"Hello\" and album of the year for \"25,\" Adele let it be known she thought Beyonc¨¦ deserved the latter. \"My artist of my life is Beyonc¨¦,\" she said. \"And this album for me, the \\'Lemonade\\' album is just so monumental.\" \"It was so monumental and so well thought out and so beautiful and soul-bearing, and we all got to see another side of you that you don\\'t always let us see and we appreciate that,\" Adele said from the stage to Beyonc¨¦, who sat in the audience. \"You are our light.\" \"The way that you make me and my friends feel -- and the way that you make my black friends feel -- is empowering,\" Adele continued. \"You make them stand up for themselves and I love you, and I always have and I always will.\" The quote about her \"black friends\" -- coming from a white artist -- had the potential to be inflammatory.

The city has seen many of its irreplaceable antiquities, monuments and historic sites destroyed since the terror group first occupied it in May 2015. Russia\\'s Defense Ministry released a statement Monday saying they have detected \"an upsurge in truck movement\" near the ancient site that indicates that ISIS is planning to cause even more damage to the ancient complex. \"We have detected an upsurge in truck movement near the ancient city amid Syrian troops\\' successful advance on Palmyra,\" the statement reads. \"This indicates that Daesh (ISIS) wants to bring in explosives to deal maximum damage to the remaining architectural relics before they leave.\" ISIS\\' enemies line up to take Raqqa, but when -- and how? Footage shows wrecked sites Footage from a Russian Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) shows the uptick in movement from ISIS\\' trucks in the region, showing \"ISIS intentions to deliver explosives in order to cause maximum damage to the leaving architectural monuments before their retreat.\" The same footage, the statement claims, also shows the destruction already wrought by the group, including the facade of the Roman theater and Tetrapylon column -- a square building erected in 270 AD -- along with the Triumphal Arch, Lion of Al-lÄ\\x81t, Temple of Baalshamin, Temple of Bel and other sites. Russian topographers and archeologists from the Institute of Material Culture History at the Russian Academy of Sciences worked with the Defense Ministry to conduct a photo survey of the site, obtaining high definition 3D metric models of the terrain and architectural objects, which show greater detail than current satellite photos, the statement said. \"All this allows to imagine comprehensively and complexly what the ancient city used to be like before the barbarian(s\\') destruction,\" the statement added. Is ISIS going broke? Almost two years of destruction ISIS fighters destroyed part of the historic Roman amphitheater in the ancient city in January after recapturing the historic city in December of last year. The amphitheater has also been used by the jihadist group for numerous executions. In August 2015 ISIS also beheaded Khaled al-As\\'ad, a university professor and the former general manager for antiquities and museums in Palmyra. He had refused to reveal location of valuable antiquities to the militants. The jihadist group first seized control of Palmyra, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, in May 2015. Syrian regime forces managed to briefly push the militants out of the city last year. But Palmyra fell to ISIS again in December when Syrian troops pulled out and over 4,000 militants returned.

       " ['People\\'s March for Education Justice nan Besty \"Amway\" DeVos clearly demonstrated at her confirmation hearings that she is unqualified to be Education Secretary. While her approval by Republicans in the United States Senate is a national embarrassment and an insult to public school families, the bigger issue is the Republican/Trump plan to privatize public education in the United States through outsourcing, vouchers, and tax credits and to eliminate opposition and make private schools the profitable by breaking teacher unions. While all public schools do not functional well, problems are rooted in poverty and discrimination in American society, not schools and teachers. Privatization is a threat to a fundamental American institution that promotes democracy and citizenship while contributing to social mobility. In response to Trump, Betsy, and the Republican Party\\'s push to privatize public education, students, teachers, parents, and community members across New York State will march on Saturday March 4 for education justice. Multiple marches are being organized by the Alliance for Quality Education (AQE). AQE charges Donald Trump and DeVos with threatening to take billions of education from New York communities. They are also concerned because \"Governor Cuomo has a history of woefully inadequate education investments\" and they believe \"his current proposal is his worst ever and would take cuts to the next level.\" The People\\'s March for Education Justice program includes: \"?Full & Fair funding for all Public Schools from Pre-K - College \"?End the School to Prison Pipeline: Solutions, not Suspensions \"?Increase Access to Early Care and Learning Opportunities for Babies & Toddlers \"?End the state\\'s over-reliance on high-stakes testing \"?Protect Public Education: End of School Privatization \"?Implement Culturally Responsive Curriculum \"?Increase Supports for Students in Poverty \"?Increase Supports for Immigrant Students & English Language Learners \"?Protect the Educational Rights of Students with Disabilities \"?Full & Fair funding for all Public Schools from Pre-K- College According to the March call \"The system of driving school funding based on zip codes and home values, perpetuates systemic racism through dramatic inequalities in educational opportunity. The racial inequality in school funding is exacerbated by the fact that New York State has the most segregated schools in the country. For over a decade we have yet to see a political will of urgency from New York State\\'s elected leaders to reverse the racial and economic inequality for our children.\" The issues are especially sharp in New York State where Governor Andrew Cuomo has essentially endorsed the Trump/DeVos educational agenda. According to the Network for Public Education, Cuomo branded public schools a \"monopoly that he wants to \"break\" and introduced a bill to provide backdoor school vouchers in the form of tax credits. An analysis of Cuomo\\'s proposed state budget shows plans \"to expand charters in NYC\" by eliminating the current cap, give more taxpayer dollars to charter schools for rent, and force New York City schools to give more space in their own school buildings to charter schools.\" Currently marches are planned for Buffalo, the Hudson Valley, Long Island, New York City, Rochester, and the Capital Region.

According to Digital Fuel Monitor, other countries have figured out how to deliver unlimited wireless services for just 16-30 EUR. (One Euro is now $1.07 US dollars.)  And even funnier, Verizon now claims it is going to offer a new unlimited wireless plan. This is after Verizon has been dumping customers who supposedly went over a magic 200GB limit. Droid Life\\'s headline says it all: \"Verizon Unlimited Users Averaging 200GB or More Per Month Getting the Boot\" But, according to the fine print in Verizon\\'s new offer, if a customer reaches just 22GB, the customer may be slowed down where other, more important priorities take over. CNBC reports: \"The plan...Verizon called a \\'great value,\\' will cost $80 for unlimited data, calls and texting; or $45 per line for four separate lines carrying the same features. There was a catch, however: Verizon added that after 22 GB of data usage on any one line, the company might \\'prioritize usage behind other customers in the event of network congestion\\'.\" And I need to laugh for a couple of reasons. This is a T-Mobile ad about their unlimited plan. It shows AT&T\\'s plan vs T-Mobile and notice all of the other AT&T charges; some, like the \"Regulatory Charge\" or the \"admin fee\", are made up. So, while the advertisement may give a price, it will have nothing to do with what the customer actually pays.  We assume Verizon will play the exact same game. Ah, but that\\'s not what is so funny. The fine print at the bottom of this T-Mobile ad, (that is too small to read), says that during congestion, the top 3% of users - those who go over 28GB/month - may experience reduced speeds. Also, the video \\'streams\\' are at 480p - about Â½ of HD, (though it appears you can adjust that so it can eat up your \\'unlimited\\' plan faster.)  Verizon can\\'t even be original and has the same \\'kill\\' plan - but at 22GB. How is this \\'unlimited\\'? But just how bad are America\\'s LTE services? We keep hearing about 5G and 1Gbps wireless speeds and...pure con, plain and simple. OpenSignal tracks the speed and other criteria of wireless services around the world.
